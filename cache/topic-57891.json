Though I<br/>\nknow one of his first references won&#39;t be a movie it would be the series<br/>\nBand of Brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a story of the experiences of Allied women and children prisoners of War<br/>\nin Singapore I&#39;d look to the BBC series Tenko.  I recall being captivated<br/>\n(horrified, stunned, aghast) by it in the 80s, and thus found the later<br/>\nmovie Paradise Road almost superficial (in part understandable: as a movie<br/>\nit couldn&#39;t stretch the length of the women&#39;s experiences, it also focussed<br/>\non the brief period in which some women formed a choir) - the flavour the<br/>\nmovie left seemed less dire, less shocking, less awe than the series.  The<br/>\nseries allowed one to develop a deeper and longer-lasting appreciation for<br/>\nthe experiences of these women by spending time with the hardships,<br/>\nindignities, ill treatment, starvation, desperate measures, ethical<br/>\ndilemmas, hopelessness, griefs - to end not with glossy conclusions about<br/>\nendurance or attitude or how singing helps or resilience but rather to end<br/>\nstill pondering.  I felt the series allowed more opportunity to appreciate<br/>\nthe variability of behaviour amongst the prison-keepers, the dramatic impact<br/>\none psychotic with authority can have -v- the challenges soldiers have in<br/>\nbehaving humanely when their leaders are not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is The Dunera Boys (an Australian movie about a camp in Australia<br/>\nto which the British sent ex-German immigrants (mostly Jews) they had<br/>\nrounded up as potential spies).<br/>\n<br/>\nMica<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Nov 3, 2010 at 6:37 PM, dezignarob &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dezigna@...\">dezigna@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One of my favorites is &quot;The Dam Busters&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046889/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046889/</a> Mostly about British engineers trying<br/>\n&gt; to make a bouncing bomb.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also enjoy &quot;Von Ryan&#39;s Express&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059885/which\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059885/which</a> is worth watching just for the Vicar&#39;s impersonation of a Nazi<br/>\n&gt; officer, and &quot;The Longest Day&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056197/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056197/</a> about<br/>\n&gt; D-Day with just about every big name actor of the day in it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Of course you won&#39;t neglect &quot;Casablanca&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/</a> for it&#39;s allegorical value.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Three Came Home&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043041/\">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043041/</a> (aside from the<br/>\n&gt; title somewhat giving away the ending) is about European women in Japanese<br/>\n&gt; prisoner camps during WWII.

Jesse, 10, got really interested in WWII as a result of watching &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot; last winter and just this week has been asking about WWII and Vietnam, got books about them from the library and wants to make a movie about one of them after he decides which interests him the most. These strewing ideas are so helpful. I had been wary of &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot; and watched it with him sure he&#39;d want to turn it off (they&#39;ve run from the room over anything too realistically violent in movies).

Thanks for all the ideas!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just had to share:<br/>\n&gt; We are watching Saints and Soldiers at the moment because it was available<br/>\n&gt; immediately on Netflix.  Not the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, but he&#39;s having<br/>\n&gt; a blast trying to identify all the guns (he&#39;s gotten into this gun<br/>\n&gt; fascination).    I am really impressed with his gun knowledge.  The story is<br/>\n&gt; based on an actual massacre near the Belgian border during WWII, and he&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; been asking all kinds of questions about the Germans and the draft (because<br/>\n&gt; we watch MASH all the time), and so we&#39;ve talked about how WWII was a more<br/>\n&gt; *popular* war to join and we had to look up whether there was a draft during<br/>\n&gt; WWII (there was), whereas Korea was not a very popular war -- we chatted<br/>\n&gt; about some possible reasons for that.  And then he started asking me about<br/>\n&gt; Vietnam -- which I know very little about.  We&#39;ve got lots of things to look<br/>\n&gt; up -- my head is swirling trying to keep track of it all.  He has connected<br/>\n&gt; this movie to the book Number the Stars, which we read together last year,<br/>\n&gt; and I think next we&#39;re going to watch Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  His dad<br/>\n&gt; was watching a documentary the other day on the bombing of Hiroshima -- and<br/>\n&gt; so we got into a conversation about the connections between Japan and China<br/>\n&gt; and Germany, and why the Korean conflict happened so soon after WWII... It<br/>\n&gt; just goes on and on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Today, while the movie was playing, he asked me where we could *rent a game<br/>\n&gt; board.*<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I said, &quot;Rent a game board?&quot;  Think.  Think.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;You mean a board game?&quot; I said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Yeah!&quot; he said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;What board game?&quot;  I said.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t care...just one about war and stuff!&quot;  he said.  So I found the<br/>\n&gt; Axis and Allies board games online, and I&#39;m thinking of getting one of them.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; By the way, he has been playing lots of video games, including one called<br/>\n&gt; World at War that is based on WWII, and he&#39;s in love with it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m just following him around in all this enthusiasm.  It&#39;s been fun, and a<br/>\n&gt; huge change from last year this time when I was still trying to force<br/>\n&gt; subjects on him.  Last year, before finding Sandra Dodd, I would have<br/>\n&gt; probably pooh-poohed his gun fascination (too violent), rolled my eyes at<br/>\n&gt; his video game obsession (a waste of time), laughed at his suggestion that<br/>\n&gt; we *rent* a board game, and never given any thought to what war movies he<br/>\n&gt; may or may not care about, and I probably would have veered away from all<br/>\n&gt; this stuff so that we could *get back to* language arts or history (haha).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And if it all ended tomorrow and he said, &quot;I decided I don&#39;t care about war<br/>\n&gt; stuff anymore.  Let&#39;s go make s&#39;mores,&quot; we&#39;d do it, and I wouldn&#39;t look<br/>\n&gt; back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just wanted to share.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Deb<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: War movies?","postDate":"1288124973","msgId":57922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3RERDM0E2LTNGREUtNEI0MS04QTJCLTAyNzMyNUNEQzI4MEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDRDQzNTlBNkQwMzAzQS1FQUMtMTEwQkB3ZWJtYWlsLW0wODIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltNmlwZzZ4ajFqaHZrSGZkUGhubU1EN0pZS3NSR3cyMmk4cmhEckBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT48aWE0ZWtmK3N0dG9AZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+PEI2MDIzMzMxQzZCQTQ3QkNBQ0EyNDA3OTQ1NzUxODNBQEVkUEM+PEFBTkxrVGlrUnBBSEVzZGUxZXppUXVSU2s1UUR3V1dEam1EaGpGaGlPV3pkZUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPEFBTkxrVGluTjJaPWFhYmVzbzlIWUJfYVM5K1FKUUhvLVRCV21zLWF0PVpta0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDhDRDQzNTlBNkQwMzAzQS1FQUMtMTEwQkB3ZWJtYWlsLW0wODIuc3lzb3BzLmFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":57921,"nextInTopic":57924,"prevInTime":57921,"nextInTime":57923,"topicId":57891,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Thanks for all the ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust had to share:<br/>\nWe are watching Saints and Soldiers at the moment because it was available<br/>\nimmediately on Netflix.  Not the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen, but he&#39;s having<br/>\na blast trying to identify all the guns (he&#39;s gotten into this gun<br/>\nfascination).    I am really impressed with his gun knowledge.  The story is<br/>\nbased on an actual massacre near the Belgian border during WWII, and he&#39;s<br/>\nbeen asking all kinds of questions about the Germans and the draft (because<br/>\nwe watch MASH all the time), and so we&#39;ve talked about how WWII was a more<br/>\n*popular* war to join and we had to look up whether there was a draft during<br/>\nWWII (there was), whereas Korea was not a very popular war -- we chatted<br/>\nabout some possible reasons for that.  And then he started asking me about<br/>\nVietnam -- which I know very little about.  We&#39;ve got lots of things to look<br/>\nup -- my head is swirling trying to keep track of it all.  He has connected<br/>\nthis movie to the book Number the Stars, which we read together last year,<br/>\nand I think next we&#39;re going to watch Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  His dad<br/>\nwas watching a documentary the other day on the bombing of Hiroshima -- and<br/>\nso we got into a conversation about the connections between Japan and China<br/>\nand Germany, and why the Korean conflict happened so soon after WWII... It<br/>\njust goes on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, while the movie was playing, he asked me where we could *rent a game<br/>\nboard.*<br/>\n<br/>\nI said, &quot;Rent a game board?&quot;  Think.  Think.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You mean a board game?&quot; I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Yeah!&quot; he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What board game?&quot;  I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t care...just one about war and stuff!&quot;  he said.  So I found the<br/>\nAxis and Allies board games online, and I&#39;m thinking of getting one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, he has been playing lots of video games, including one called<br/>\nWorld at War that is based on WWII, and he&#39;s in love with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just following him around in all this enthusiasm.  It&#39;s been fun, and a<br/>\nhuge change from last year this time when I was still trying to force<br/>\nsubjects on him.  Last year, before finding Sandra Dodd, I would have<br/>\nprobably pooh-poohed his gun fascination (too violent), rolled my eyes at<br/>\nhis video game obsession (a waste of time), laughed at his suggestion that<br/>\nwe *rent* a board game, and never given any thought to what war movies he<br/>\nmay or may not care about, and I probably would have veered away from all<br/>\nthis stuff so that we could *get back to* language arts or history (haha).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if it all ended tomorrow and he said, &quot;I decided I don&#39;t care about war<br/>\nstuff anymore.

One of our favorites was &quot;Boy in the Striped Pajamas.&quot; PG-13<br/>\nSet during World War II, a story seen through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant at a concentration camp, whose forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence has startling and unexpected consequences. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old enjoyed &quot;The Pianist&quot; from 2002 as well. It is rated R though. Famed Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody, in an Oscar-winning role) struggles to survive the onslaught of Nazi tyranny during World War II in this Roman Polanski-directed drama based on Szpilman&#39;s memoirs. In spite of his well-known musical talents, Szpilman spends several years holed up in Warsaw, barely alive and subsisting on scraps, until grace comes in the form of a second chance -- at music, at freedom and at life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may or may not be too much violence for a 10 year old.

Any other<br/>\nsuggestions or recs?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nDeb<br/>\nCaitlin, 15<br/>\nJulian, 10<br/>\nJosephine, 20 months<br/>\nAutumn, 5 months<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57985,"nextTopicId":57989}}
