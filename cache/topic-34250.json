She is the type that jumps to<br/>\nconclusions and, for lack of a better word, is a &quot;drama queen&quot;. This is what<br/>\nshe says to me when I try and talk to her about it (and go with a very huffy<br/>\nand irritated voice here), &quot;Are you saying I HAVE to play with Lilly?&quot;<br/>\nTotally not what I am saying, but she must hear that. Apparently I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow how to talk to her so that I *don&#39;t* get those kinds of responses<br/>\nthough. She often says things like that in that tone of voice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nIn exchange for that, then you could give her lots of uninterrupted<br/>\ntime so that Lilly starts to see that sometimes Marti needs time<br/>\nalone, but it won&#39;t be a long series of &quot;no&quot; with an occasional &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nI think we do give her a lot of uninterrupted time, but I will ask and see<br/>\nwhat she thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nAlso, I bet they could get along better outside the house, away from<br/>\nMarti&#39;s possessions and space.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nI think you&#39;re right and I love your suggestions, however that brings me to<br/>\nanother post I have been meaning to write...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are without a vehicle right now. Are there any unschoolers out there who<br/>\nmanage without a car?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live on a bus route, but our car breaking down has been a *huge*<br/>\nlifestyle change for us. It takes a long time to get somewhere on the bus<br/>\nand the bus is really hot, which is not something we can control and the<br/>\nthree of us (Me and the girls) get motion sickness, especially when its hot.<br/>\nWe also can&#39;t go to places that we went before, because they are either not<br/>\non the bus route at all or we would need to transfer busses multiple times.<br/>\nLike, we used to go to one particular library on the other side of the town<br/>\nnext to us. It took us about 1/2 hour to get there by car, but it would take<br/>\n1 1/2 hours on the bus to get there and 2 to get home, plus we would have to<br/>\ntransfer busses 4 times and it would cost us nearly $12.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know right now, I am feeling trapped and I think Lilly especially is too.<br/>\nWe are not sure when we are going to be able to get the car fixed. Much of<br/>\nthe money we are saving in gas is either going into savings to get the car<br/>\nfixed or to pay for rides on the bus. I need a big perspective change when<br/>\nit comes to this, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do have a couple of parks nearby, that is to say a 20+ minute walk away,<br/>\nand we try to get out to them when Daddy has the day off of work (so that we<br/>\ncan take both strollers because the girls are obviously going to be tired on<br/>\nthe way home and not want to walk), but that is only 2 days a week and it is<br/>\nspring so if it&#39;s cold or raining on one of those two days, we are out of<br/>\nluck.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nI got Roya to try out playing with Roxana for an hour first thing in the<br/>\nday.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI will see if there is a good time for Marti. Right now we are at a point<br/>\nthat the only time Marti wants to play with Lilly is when we go upstairs at<br/>\nnight for bed and at that point Lilly is tired. She has asked to go to bed<br/>\nand she even tells Marti to stop &quot;jumping on the bed&quot; and &quot;roughhousing&quot;<br/>\nbecause she is tired.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nWith us, I would ask Kirby to do something Marty liked for a while<br/>\nsometimes. And occasionally I would offer Kirby money to distract<br/>\nMarty while I needed to do something else. He would read to him, or<br/>\nplay something strenuous outside. The difference between those times<br/>\nand the play-by-choice times were a little like a practice job for<br/>\nKirby. It was always optional. Sometimes he wanted money to buy<br/>\nNinja Turtles.<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\nIf I *ask* Marti to play with Lilly the answer is always an automatic &quot;no&quot;.<br/>\nEven if she isn&#39;t doing anything. Maybe because I have asked too many times<br/>\nwhen she has been doing something, I am not sure, but I try really hard not<br/>\nto do that to her. I know that she sees things way differently than I do<br/>\nthough so it is, of course, possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunatley paying her isn&#39;t an option right now due mostly to the car<br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSwap books.
