She challenged (bribed)<br/>\nthem to learn it by telling them that if they could say it by memory when<br/>\nthey saw her next, she would pay them some money - a whopping $2.50 each! My<br/>\nboys almost didn&#39;t do it because they said $2.50 was not enough to go<br/>\nthrough the trouble of memorizing it - but they did it anyway to please her,<br/>\nmostly, and just to prove to themselves and her that they could do it. They<br/>\ndid memorize it - it took about an hour with me helping them. They recited<br/>\nif off perfectly for her - she was VERY impressed and gave them the money.<br/>\nOh yeah, they started to recite it for her at first and didn&#39;t have their<br/>\nhand over their heart and she stopped them and said it didn&#39;t count unless<br/>\ntheir right hand was over their heart. Now - about a month or two later -<br/>\nthey both still DO remember most of it. I remember every word of it from<br/>\nwhen I was in school. My feelings are that I just went along with it all<br/>\nfiguring that saying something against it would do much more damage than me<br/>\nkeeping my mouth shut. At least they don&#39;t have to say it every day, when<br/>\nclass starts, looking at the flag, like I did when I was a kid, not really<br/>\neven knowing what I was saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9119,"nextTopicId":9123}}
