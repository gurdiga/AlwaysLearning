So for me, it looks like Montreal; just sayin&#39;.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people read about unschooling and then turn the computer off or  <br/>\nput the books and magazines away, and they live with their kids in a  <br/>\nway they think they understood, and then come back and complain that  <br/>\ntheir initial understanding didn&#39;t work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people read and write online for hours, weeks, one person even  <br/>\nYEARS, before changing anything about the way they are interacting  <br/>\nwith their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people take a suggestion, go and try it once or twice, and come  <br/>\nback and say &quot;That didn&#39;t work; now what?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read a little, put a toe in the water of trying it out, think  <br/>\nabout it, sleep on it, try it some more, listen to your kids and watch  <br/>\nthem and hold them (you can feel when a child is tense or relaxed by  <br/>\nholding or hugging; I hope all the parents here can do that, and if  <br/>\nnot, practice that--WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT IT TO THEM), then come back  <br/>\nand ask another question if you have one, or read more online, or talk  <br/>\nto other unschoolers... that is how confidence comes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s one thing to do something because you read that other people&#39;s  <br/>\nkids responded well to it.  Taking children out of school on the basis  <br/>\nof faith that other people&#39;s kids did well without school is fine, but  <br/>\nthat&#39;s still about other people.  Little by little you will start to  <br/>\nsee your own child learn without being taught, and be there when your  <br/>\nown child asks very cool questions and makes connections between ideas  <br/>\nthat you yourself never considered.  And soon you&#39;ll be one of the  <br/>\npeople other people are basing their own initial faith on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s gradual.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/confidence\">http://sandradodd.com/confidence</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57150,"nextTopicId":57248}}
