The girls liked that idea.  But I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;re figuring the math right.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa owes $4 to Jackie.  So we gave Jackie $4 from the bank, then gave Lisa $4 from the bank, but she turned it upside down to show that it was $4 in debt.  When she earned $2 passing go, she would then be $2 in debt instead of $4.  I told the girls that the bank would charge interest, but that was too complicated for me to figure out with play money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLisa asked if the real bank would give you upside down money when you borrowed it.  I explained that they give you a piece of paper telling how much you owe.  Maybe we should keep track of the debt on paper, instead of with upside down money.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other ideas on this variation?<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13069,"nextTopicId":13021}}
