I rented <br/>\npaper moon because one day we were mixed up about change for a $20, and which <br/>\nway it would go, with her needing to give me some money back for me to give <br/>\nher her allowance and some money I had borrowed, but she would keep the $20.  <br/>\nIt got so crazy and funny that I tried to tell her about the $20 bill scam <br/>\nfrom Paper Moon, and couldn&#39;t remember it exactly, so I rented the movie.  <br/>\nHolly LOVED the music.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for Christmas I ordered a CD with songs from that.  We discovered Irving <br/>\nBerlin (&quot;Let&#39;s Have Another Cup of Coffee&quot;) also wrote Annie Get your Gun, <br/>\nwhich Holly knew had discovered at a friend&#39;s house.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe rented Top Hat, because &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; was on her CD.  She LOVED <br/>\nthat--we kept it ten days.  So I ordered a CD of Fred Astaire doing all <br/>\nIrving Berlin songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere in the depths of the Wizard of Oz video was something about <br/>\n&quot;Everybody Sing,&quot; an old Judy Garland movie.  Holly wanted to see it; we <br/>\nfound it and rented it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne song on there, &quot;Why? Because&quot; (I think it&#39;s called), Holly loved, and she <br/>\nwanted the lyrics.  The lyrics weren&#39;t online (or I didn&#39;t find them) but I <br/>\nDID find an ad for a Judy Garland CD collection of stuff from MGM movies, <br/>\nwith that song on it.  AND there were lots of songs from Annie Get your Gun <br/>\nthere.  We ordered it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTuesday  night was a friend&#39;s birthday party, and we went to buy him a DVD.  <br/>\nBladerunner, we thought (endedstory, were some scenes with... JUDY GARLAND!  <br/>\nSo two days ago Holly saw film of two songs from the movie, with Judy <br/>\nGarland.  It was finished with another actress instead, because Judy Garland <br/>\ngot sick and couldn&#39;t finish the movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, the Judy Garland CD came.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(I should keep this in Holly&#39;s diary, to show the speed with which this <br/>\nIrving Berlin &quot;unit study&quot; came on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the bid deal:  In my whole life I have had a great aversion to that <br/>\nstyle of music.  Keith pressed me to watch some Fred Astaire stuff, and he <br/>\nwas right, it was nice, but I was still tepid.   I&#39;ve never liked Judy <br/>\nGarland much at all.  I didn&#39;t realize what all Irving Berlin had done.  I <br/>\nnever knew anything about Annie Get your Gun until Holly told me about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this wasn&#39;t something I taught Holly.  It was me facilitating her <br/>\ninterest, connecting dots as they appeared one or two at a time, encouraging <br/>\nher, enabling her, and sharing her interest.  Now I&#39;m actually pretty <br/>\ninterested, and we&#39;ll probably look for some Fanny Brice stuff, because she&#39;s <br/>\nthe other singer on the &quot;Why? Because&quot; number.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh--Shirley Temple figured into this some too, but was in parallel (similar <br/>\nmusic and time period).<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly will know more about the 1930&#39;s (she asks LOTS of questions about the <br/>\ndepression) by the time she&#39;s grown than I&#39;ve ever known or ever wanted to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!
