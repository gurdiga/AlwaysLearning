BE your child in that moment, BE the parent *YOU* <br/>\nneeded to have in those moments that shaped who you are in *this* exact <br/>\nmoment.  When I step back and realize that I&#39;m replaying a horrible tape <br/>\nfrom my own childhood, it&#39;s like a splash of cold water on my soul.  My <br/>\nheart tells me to strive to be the parent I&#39;m meant to be with my own <br/>\nchildren, not some knee-jerk replication of my family&#39;s history.  <br/>\nKnee-jerk is easy AND it&#39;s damaging and painful; thoughtful parenting is <br/>\ntougher (to begin) AND is healing (to parent) and nurturing (to parent <br/>\nand child/ren). <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Yes, feel bad.

Once there, she helped her <br/>\nfriend ready the horse, all along quietly reminding me she wasn&#39;t going <br/>\nto ride today.  We watched the other girls have their lessons and when <br/>\nHannah&#39;s turn came, she looked at me with tears in her eyes and asked <br/>\nthat I tell the teacher she wasn&#39;t riding.  The volume button in my head <br/>\nwas really hard to reach and I almost caved in to those voices, when I <br/>\nrealized the *ONE* person I needed to listen to right now is Hannah and <br/>\nHannah alone.  I hugged her sad, scared little Self and told Deb she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to ride today.  The confusion on the teacher&#39;s face was <br/>\npriceless!  How do you chastise a kid who came in and did the hard part <br/>\nof the lesson and doesn&#39;t want to do the fun part??  As she sputtered <br/>\nabout charging without 24 hour notice, I quickly assured her I had no <br/>\nproblem paying for the lesson and I was glad to have Hannah&#39;s wishes <br/>\nrespected.  As soon as we adults were okay with her &quot;no,&quot; she helped her <br/>\nfriend take off the saddle and lead the horse to the field, where we fed <br/>\nhim the apples we brought along.  Deb kindly asked Hannah if there was <br/>\nsomething *she* could do to make riding lessons less angstful for her.  <br/>\nHannah told her &quot;it&#39;s just today, I don&#39;t feel like riding today&quot; and <br/>\nDeb accepted it.  Hannah&#39;s now looking forward to her next lesson.

Years back I was more likely to.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow others in the family are more likely to smile if I&#39;m having a  <br/>\nmelt-down than to cringe.  There&#39;s nothing to cringe about.  Kirby  <br/>\nthinks I should have more self control and so he expresses disgust  <br/>\n(facially, and he leaves the room) if I&#39;m frustrated or angry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat Kirby who thinks I should be able to control my emotions better  <br/>\nwas a little kid who was quick to fury, broke things, lunged at his  <br/>\nbrother, threw himself down crying...  but we never said &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>\nokay, Kirby.&quot;  We figured out how we could try to avoid the  <br/>\nsituations he was in and we would get people and things out of his  <br/>\nrange and hold him or sit across from him and help him express  <br/>\nhimself and to breathe, the combination of which are a quicky home- <br/>\nversion of drugs and therapy.  Oxygen and the opportunity to express  <br/>\nthe rage and the practice and assistance to put it into better words  <br/>\nand context moved him QUICKLY to a place I will probably never be,  <br/>\nbecause while I had years of no help, years of reinforcement for bad  <br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little if an adult was having a tantrum, it was assumed  <br/>\nthat it was WHOLLY justified and probably the &quot;fault&quot; of me or  <br/>\nanother kid.  It was assumed to be okay that when that adult did calm  <br/>\ndown (or maybe just a while before), a kid could get a spanking, or  <br/>\nsome big punishment.  And we wouldn&#39;t have laughed or smiled or said  <br/>\n&quot;Sheesh, mom--breathe!!&quot;   Because then we&#39;d&#39;ve been slapped.  So we  <br/>\nwere somewhat trained to accept those fits as normal and right and  <br/>\ngood and our fault.   Many years of that went by in my life, and when  <br/>\nI was in my 20&#39;s, I had few good tricks for self-calming (though I  <br/>\nhad more than some of my friends, because I had been meditating since  <br/>\nI was fifteen, and though it wasn&#39;t regular or daily, I had the tool  <br/>\nand I knew how to induce that state more quickly than if I&#39;d never  <br/>\nbeen there.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s a long ramble to get to this point:<br/>\nIf this list turns into a &quot;support group&quot; for moms who lose it, we  <br/>\nwill enable people to continue to lose it and feel justified.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one feels about to lose it, that&#39;s a good time to look around  <br/>\nand see what she should have or could have done differently in the  <br/>\nhour or day before that.  Is it time to go and you&#39;re not ready?   <br/>\nThat is not the fault of your husband or children.  Suck it up.     <br/>\nDid you forget to do something you said you&#39;d do and now you&#39;re  <br/>\nembarrassed and frustrated?  That&#39;s not anyone else&#39;s fault.   <br/>\nApologize sweetly and make a quick Plan B.  Get a packet of phrases  <br/>\n(affirmations, tricks) and learn to change your posture and to take a  <br/>\nfew breaths in whatever way calms you.  I do slow, deep and hold, and  <br/>\nlet it out slowly, and then huff out the last bit, and start a new  <br/>\nslow deep one, and after years of that being my best trick, I can  <br/>\nusually calm down in less than two breaths now, though there was a  <br/>\ntime it took several, or a fast walk.<br/>\n<br/>\nFast walk is a good trick.  If you think you&#39;re about to cry or roar,  <br/>\ndo a real thing.  Take the compost out, or the trash.  Go and refill  <br/>\nthe bird feeder.  Check the mail box.  Then if you need to cry you&#39;re  <br/>\naway from little kids who might be freaked out and feel responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nParent yourself when you&#39;re feeling like you&#39;re losing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt probably helps new unschoolers to know we&#39;re not perfect moms, but  <br/>\nit won&#39;t help them if we say &quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about it.  Everyone  <br/>\nloses it.  It&#39;s normal.  Don&#39;t feel bad.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, feel bad.   Yes, desire to do better.   Yes, learn to manage  <br/>\nlife so that the frustrations are avoided and aren&#39;t so harmful when  <br/>\nthey can&#39;t be avoided.  Maybe  you can&#39;t jump there all in one great  <br/>\nstride, but if that&#39;s where you want to go, every choice you make can  <br/>\nbe made with that destination in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] thank you","postDate":"1136645386","msgId":23867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDN0UxQjBCQzgyRDBBQi0yMjgtNTQ5NEBGV00tTTQ0LnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTA2MDYzMDMzLjUxNTgxMDhCQGRtMjEubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTA2MDYzMDMzLjUxNTgxMDhCQGRtMjEubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":23853,"nextInTopic":23869,"prevInTime":23866,"nextInTime":23868,"topicId":23823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Maybe you&#39;ve learned that compared to most people,<br/>\nyou have a lower tolerance to some things, and you *feel* tired after those<br/>\nkinds of stimulants.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] thank you","postDate":"1136559501","msgId":23825,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlBQTI0QTBFLUM2QUQtNDlENS1BREVCLTVGRDNFNERGQ0U4NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTA2MDYzMDMzLjUxNTgxMDhCQGRtMjEubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTA2MDYzMDMzLjUxNTgxMDhCQGRtMjEubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":23823,"nextInTopic":23828,"prevInTime":23824,"nextInTime":23826,"topicId":23823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ======================= What some people describe as kids testing parents (and isn t that always presented in a negative manner, as though the kids are","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-679413296\">On Jan 6, 2006, at 7:30 AM, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:janclan@...\">janclan@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; i think when the unkindness happens that being tired and/or hungry  <br/>\n&gt; is usually the cause and sometimes its just testing like behaviour<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=======================<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat some people describe as kids &quot;testing&quot; parents (and isn&#39;t that  <br/>\nalways presented in a negative manner, as though the kids are sneaky,  <br/>\nmanipulative and bad?) can be seen as them simply communicating and  <br/>\nattempting to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to put a positive spin on how you see situations with your  <br/>\nchildren, and how you phrase things.<br/>\n<br/>\nWords and ideas change thought and behavior.  It&#39;s not (as people  <br/>\nlike to say when they don&#39;t want to really think about it) &quot;just  <br/>\nsemantics.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I often say I &quot;have a delicate sanity&quot; and what that really means  <br/>\nis I get tired-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou often say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Tired&quot; sometimes means feeling powerless or overwhelmed.   Every  <br/>\nstep you take toward seeing that your life is made of conscious  <br/>\nchoices will energize you, I think.  When people feel helpless and  <br/>\nput-upon, that can feel like tiredness.     Bolster up your sanity  <br/>\nwith knowledge of how learning works and how you can help yourself  <br/>\nand your kids learn, and how you can maintain the kind of peaceful  <br/>\nyet busy environment that makes for good unschooling.  Have a focus.   <br/>\nPeople without priorities can sometimes feel that they&#39;re wallowing  <br/>\nand flailing in confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus doesn&#39;t mean you need to have a big plan and schedule.  That&#39;s  <br/>\nhow priorities and principles work.  If your priority is the cleanest  <br/>\npossible house, then that will cause you to make decisions based on  <br/>\nwhat will get your house clean and keep it that way.    If you  <br/>\npriority is three sit-down meals every single day with your whole  <br/>\nfamily present, then THAT is how you will decide whether it&#39;s okay  <br/>\nfor your children to sleep in or stay at a friend&#39;s house longer.   <br/>\nThe answer would be no, because it would conflict with your first  <br/>\npriority.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy priority has long been to help my kids discover the world in fun  <br/>\nand safe ways.  So if they want to stay up really late playing online  <br/>\ngames with people on other continents, that seems (within my  <br/>\npriorities) vastly superior to a sit-down breakfast just because it&#39;s  <br/>\n7:30 a.m.  They can sleep.  I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re not hungry.   <br/>\nThere&#39;s food available that they can get easily on their own, and I&#39;m  <br/>\nwilling to cook for them if they&#39;d rather have pancakes or scrambled  <br/>\neggs or something.  That&#39;s not a schedule, and it doesn&#39;t take a lot  <br/>\nof thinking.  Each decision is made based on the principles and  <br/>\npriorities that support unschooling at our house.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf clean house were my one main focus, it would be better for me and  <br/>\nmy house for the kids to have gone to school so I could clean up, and  <br/>\nthey wouldn&#39;t have or need so much stuff at home, because their  <br/>\nlearning would be relegated to schooltime and school&#39;s buildings.   <br/>\nWhy would our house need maps and globes?  That wouldn&#39;t be my job,  <br/>\nor the purpose of our house.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-it seems the long haulers don&#39;t really talk about getting tired or  <br/>\nlazy or having a hard time -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was harder when I was newer at it, and when my kids were all  <br/>\nlittle there were days I hardly got to think of anything that wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nthe in-my-face sticky or poopy mess of the moment.  Talking about how  <br/>\nhard it is doesn&#39;t help much, but talking about how it can be easier  <br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":200789511,"authorName":"janclan@netscape.com","from":"&lt;janclan@...&gt;","profile":"janqlan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"thank you","postDate":"1136557833","msgId":23823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwMTA2MDYzMDMzLjUxNTgxMDhCQGRtMjEubXRhLmV2ZXJ5b25lLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23825,"prevInTime":23822,"nextInTime":23824,"topicId":23823,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra  : I ll definitely check your site rec s and read and try to change what i m doing....i think when the unkindness happens that being tired and/or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1219592015\">Sandra  :<br/>\nI&#39;ll definitely check your site rec&#39;s and read and try to change what &quot;i&#39;m&quot; doing....i think when the unkindness happens that being tired and/or hungry is usually the cause and sometimes its just testing like behaviour but I&#39;m gonna try to observe more and see if thats really it......it all just takes so much thinking and I guess sometimes i get lazy.........it really takes a lot of work ( for me)to be this kind of parent but its the right thing to do and no one is making me.....
