By being open and honest, I mean owning it when I mess<br/>\nup and apologizing to the kids/husband when I make choices that aren&#39;t so<br/>\ngreat and then working to fix what I messed up.  We are all works in<br/>\nprogress.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I think that many times a parent can feel desperate; not<br/>\nto mess up their kids, to feel like they know what they are doing, to<br/>\n&quot;prove&quot; that she/he is doing the parenting thing &quot;right&quot; to relatives and<br/>\nfriends.  My way of dealing with disapproving relatives was to let them<br/>\nknow in no uncertain terms that I and my husband were the parents and would<br/>\nbe making the decisions about our family, which included our kids, and that<br/>\ntheir approval was &quot;neither required nor desired&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forget that many people find it very difficult to deal with any<br/>\nconflict--even conflict that they perceive from an email list, and so<br/>\nsometimes they just &quot;break&quot; and start the equivalent of a tantrum in type.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while I agree that it is NOT acceptable to dump on anyone like that<br/>\nwhether in person or in print, I think I get why it happens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Sandra for your diligence with this list and for sparing the rest<br/>\nof us the full impact of the unnamed author&#39;s tirade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sandra note:<br/>\n&gt; Had she actually reread the thread instead of posting, more than one life<br/>\n&gt; would have been better.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love the sentiment of this note so much that I wanted to leave it here.<br/>\n:)<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How not to post to the discussion","postDate":"1331912738","msgId":66180,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGNTEwODlCLUUwRTQtNDBBQy1CMEI4LUIwN0ZEM0NBOUVCNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYyMjIyNDEyLTk4RkItNDg5Ny04MkFGLTU4QjEyRkFCQjkzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDYyMjIyNDEyLTk4RkItNDg5Ny04MkFGLTU4QjEyRkFCQjkzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66178,"nextInTopic":66181,"prevInTime":66179,"nextInTime":66181,"topicId":66178,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- you are not interested in examining anything and I feel very very sorry for the poor souls who get taken in by your pretending to offer anything - except","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-153756368\">-=-&quot;you are not interested in examining anything and I feel very<br/>\nvery sorry for the poor souls who get taken in by your <br/>\npretending to offer anything - except your own defense of <br/>\nNEGLECT &quot;-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI have examined quite a few things in my life, and in the time I&#39;ve been unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offer this:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com\">http://sandradodd.com</a><br/>\nand this discussion<br/>\none at facebook (I don&#39;t love it as I love this one)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/\">http://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the best thing these days is Just Add Light and Stir<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m speaking several places this spring-to-fall<br/>\nMassachusetts in two months and then several others.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/\">http://speakingsandradodd.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThose aren&#39;t pretend.

It helps me grow as a human being and I do not know how you have the patience some days. All you do to help us Unschoolers and to get scathing remarks and yet you do not give up. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. That you can see past the few who do not want to examine themselves~ and grow from what you graciously share, to their loss and to their child&#39;s detriment.

She hasn&#39;t been thrown out, though.  I know that sometimes people calm down and think, after getting all riled up.  I know that sometimes when someone is posting late at night there&#39;s alcohol or exhaustion involved.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut five minutes wasn&#39;t enough time to have read the four posts to which she was responding, and to have thought about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to this from Glenda, &quot;Sandra recommends to read a little, try a little, wait a while, and watch. Reread the thread and let it roll around in your mind for several days, taking irritation out of the picture. Maybe there will be an &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment for you. Or maybe not. But I bet there WILL be for *someone* who&#39;s been reading this thread&quot;...<br/>\n<br/>\n...the person wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nyou seriously need help!  psychological help!  I&#39;ve been reading this<br/>\nlist since 2003!  from my yahoo email - duh!  I just moved all my<br/>\nlists to a separate email address so they wouldn&#39;t fill my main<br/>\nmailbox.  How ridiculous you all are - I said I was looking for help<br/>\nand suggestions, and the only thing you did was assume and accuse -<br/>\nwhere is the &quot;discussion&quot; there?  You all give unschooling a very very<br/>\nbad name.<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSandra note:<br/>\nHad she actually reread the thread instead of posting, more than one life would have been better.<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis was in response to Marina, whose post was also nice, and written of her own free will in her volunteer time, in order to be helpful:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-what the heck is any of this post supposed to mean? and how <br/>\nis it related to my question? If you don&#39;t have any first <br/>\nhand experience with allergies then why are you posting? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------------------------------------<br/>\nSandra note:<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t a discussion about allergies.  It&#39;s about unschooling.<br/>\nBut Marina was writing about food and allergies, and ended with &quot; I found as a La Leche Leader many babies who were rejecting foods, later were identified as being allergic.&quot;  Yet someone was rude to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one was directed toward me:  <br/>\n&quot;you are not interested in examining anything and I feel very<br/>\nvery sorry for the poor souls who get taken in by your <br/>\npretending to offer anything - except your own defense of <br/>\nNEGLECT &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand also to me, though about another e-mail reporting the changes in a mom&#39;s beliefs after she actually saw her children turn down sweets:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Sandra you really are an idiot if you think that this trumps<br/>\nphysical science -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to the unnamed author of that vitriol, don&#39;t drink and post.  If you weren&#39;t drinking, don&#39;t wind yourself up into a fury and post a bunch of rude crap on my list ever again.   It certainly doesn&#39;t seem to reflect an eight-year familiarity with this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs was noted by a couple of posters, &quot;physical science&quot; covers a large area, and not all nutritionists agree, and few nutrition-faddists agree, and not all allergists agree, and not all evidence is equally valid.   <br/>\n<br/>\nEvidence to the contrary of &quot;physical science&quot; does, every time, throw a shadow of doubt on the validity of the &quot;science.&quot;  That point was also being made in this discussion.  Unschooling itself goes against educational research, and so people look at WHY the educational research exists, who approved and published it, and what their motives are.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously...  in addition to the insults, the use of <br/>\n&quot;duh&quot;<br/>\n&quot;ridiculous&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;idiot&quot; are enough that if it had happened at my house, I would have said &quot;go home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/ridiculous\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/ridiculous</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66176,"nextTopicId":66200}}
