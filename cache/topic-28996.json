There were  <br/>\nthings I couldn&#39;t do with three children.  Kirby needed more time and  <br/>\ntouch and attention that he didn&#39;t get, and it showed then and it  <br/>\nshows now.  If I was  holding Holly and Holding Marty&#39;s hand, Kirby  <br/>\nheld onto the diaper bag.  A diaper bag just isn&#39;t a mom.

The problem is all that lead up to  <br/>\nthe outburst. One problem is lots of kids. That&#39;s just your reality.  <br/>\nRight now it&#39;s raining. That&#39;s my reality.

If a child is having a melt down, do  <br/>\nthis.<br/>\n<br/>\nMindful parenting advice focuses on the cause of the behaviors and  <br/>\nhelps parents figure out ways to adjust their environments to prevent  <br/>\nas many of the problems as possible. An outburst is an opportunity to  <br/>\nfigure out what went wrong and what you might do next time to avoid  <br/>\nwhat lead up to it. Sometimes you have to move many steps back.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeltdowns will happen and you deal with them as best you can, giving  <br/>\na child as much love and attention as he needs. (And if a new milk  <br/>\nwill help, a new milk.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We want to go out and enjoy our time together but I usually end up<br/>\n&gt; feeling frazzled and like I cant handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think this is the crux. Some mothers will be able to take 4 kids to  <br/>\nthe mall and all will have a great time but that&#39;s because she has a  <br/>\ndifferent mix of personalities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s way easier to help someone who has a small problem in a  <br/>\nparticular situation than to help someone who is putting themselves  <br/>\nin a situation where there are so many problems that it leads to her  <br/>\nbeing frazzled. The *real* problem is going into situations that  <br/>\ncreate way more problems than you can handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink of it this way. You can adequately juggle 4 balls. You&#39;re  <br/>\ntrying to add 20 balls (by going to the mall or whatever situation  <br/>\ncreates frazzlement) and then asking for advice on how to handle the  <br/>\n20 balls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re saying, don&#39;t add so many balls! Try one more ball. Try putting  <br/>\ndown three balls and adding a plate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids + mall = crying kids and frazzled mom, take out the mall! ;-)  <br/>\nTake one or two children to the mall. Take all the children to the park.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour reality is that all going out together *is* going to be  <br/>\nstressful. There isn&#39;t a way around that with your particular  <br/>\nchildren and your particular situation. Rethink where you take them  <br/>\nfor now. It might have been better for dad to take 1 or 2 kids to the  <br/>\nmovies and you take the others somewhere else. It might have been  <br/>\nbetter to wait until Shrek came out on DVD.<br/>\n<br/>\nEngage your kids in the process. Approach it with a &quot;Let&#39;s see how we  <br/>\ncan work this out&quot; attitude. This might take some practice.  <br/>\nEspecially if kids feel their needs aren&#39;t being met, they won&#39;t care  <br/>\nabout stepping on the toes of others to get what they want. They  <br/>\nmight feel the youngest&#39;s needs for less stress aren&#39;t as important  <br/>\nas their need for a toy. Rather than an indication of selfish  <br/>\nchildren, it&#39;s an indication of needs that aren&#39;t being met. When  <br/>\nkids are full and know they don&#39;t need to worry about not being full,  <br/>\nthey don&#39;t need to fight each other to get what they need and can in  <br/>\nfact be generous and give up something for someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids need to know that the parent takes the request for a toy  <br/>\nseriously and will get it for them when the situation will be good  <br/>\nfor everyone. It can take a while of doing that in order for kids to  <br/>\ntrust that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Hole in the Milkbox","postDate":"1180940764","msgId":29054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVMQUdIQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRGRTY3RDlDLTlEMzUtNDJDMi04NjBCLTlGRDU0OTVFMUY4NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29050,"nextInTopic":29055,"prevInTime":29053,"nextInTime":29055,"topicId":28996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... provide them all with the touch and direct attention and mom-gaze that they would like to have (or need).","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1332939912\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;It is possible to have so many children so quickly that the mom can&#39;t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>provide them all with the touch and direct attention and mom-gaze<br/>\nthat they would like to have (or need).&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read beyond this post, but had to say a resounding YES!! to this<br/>\nquestion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving had 4 in 5 years, it WAS impossible to meet all their real needs all<br/>\nthe time.

I cant do <br/>\nanything about that. I cannot go back in time and say oh, I only <br/>\nwant one child for now. It is what it is. And after Isaiah had his <br/>\nfit we went and played in the play area and he had a great time. <br/>\nThey all did.It was fun and the only thing I would change is buying <br/>\nhim that other damn milk box. Im sure he was frustrated and I see <br/>\nhow he may have felt like I wasnt hearing him. But I am not going to <br/>\nstop taking them to the play area. They really enjoy that even if <br/>\nthere are a few mishaps on the way. But I know that I pay attention <br/>\nto him and my others as much as I can. My house is pretty much <br/>\ntrashed all the time b/c I am either with them or researching <br/>\nunschooling on the net to get more ideas. I am putting a great <br/>\neffort into this.

You can give the child all the <br/>\nattention in the world and they will still have outbursts and fits. <br/>\nIt may not be as frequent but Im sure it will happen sooner or later.<br/>\nMy children are happy and I enjoy them very much.

I<br/>\nunderstand that you all want to go out, but perhaps you could pick<br/>\nless stimulating, intense destinations than the mall (just for now)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this example you gave, it sounds like Isaiah has a hard time with<br/>\ncompetition.  I forget how old he is, but some folks just don&#39;t do<br/>\ncompetition well (and they usually, but now always, grow out of it). <br/>\nI would be on the alert for these kinds of situations and try to head<br/>\nthem off with whatever tool I could find.  My goal would be to replace<br/>\nthe yucky feelings with Joyful times.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, my son has never done competition too well and would get<br/>\nvery upset if someone else won.  So, we defuse competitions by goofing<br/>\nabout it.  He and my husband came up with changing things up so that<br/>\nthe *last* one there wins, or you don&#39;t win unless you&#39;ve cheated. <br/>\nNow, instead of getting hot under the collar and taking things so<br/>\nseriously, there&#39;s gales of laughter around races to the car, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther games like chess and Monopoly and poker are more fun now because<br/>\nLiam (now 12) sees how he can learn from playing with someone who is<br/>\nmore adept at the game than he is.  But, this is a recent change, and<br/>\nwe just stayed away from stuff like that until now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur situation is different than yours because our son has no sibs to<br/>\nmeasure himself to, but perhaps you and Isaiah and Maya can come up<br/>\nwith creative ideas (during calmer times) to eliminate competitive<br/>\nsituations and replace them with fun for fun&#39;s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I would really consider toning down the outings to keep Isaiah in<br/>\nless stressful situations until you feel that he would be better able<br/>\nto handle them.  Or, perhaps consider going on special outings with<br/>\njust him sometimes and just Maya sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am not into controlling my kids or bossing them around and think <br/>\n&gt; of them as people not as objects at my command. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think the only two choices you have are either allowing chaos<br/>\nor being authoritarian.

I want to let you all know <br/>\nthat I do spend alot of time with Isaiah. We watch tv together, we <br/>\ncuddle alot, read stories, play outside. As much as possible with <br/>\nthe other 3. I felt like some people were making it sound like I <br/>\nignore my son and neglect his needs.  <br/>\nI knew I should&#39;ve got him the other milk. No the other kids would <br/>\nnot have drank it. I thought I was being sensitive to his needs when <br/>\nI bought him what he asked for. But it would have made him feel like <br/>\nI cared a/b his feelings if I bought him the other one- I agree with <br/>\nyou all on that. It was my mistake. It is difficult when I go out to <br/>\nmake sure I am meeting every single childs needs all of the time. <br/>\nAnd I do try. I was standing in line at the coffee shop with the <br/>\nbaby in my arms. my 2 yr old in the stroller trying to distract him <br/>\nso he wouldnt climb out and run off and the other 2 who are prone to <br/>\nwondering. So when I got them their drinks I was hurrying to get <br/>\nthem to them so we could make it to the play area before my 2 babies <br/>\nstarted to cry. <br/>\nEven today when we went to the mall to get some toys and some <br/>\nicecream. My older 2 take off running when we get in the mall and I <br/>\nhave my toddler in my hand. ( My hubby kept the baby) Maya won the <br/>\nrace and Isaiah wigged b/c he wasnt first and sat down in the chair <br/>\nand threw his money down and said he wasnt going anywhere. I got on <br/>\nhis level and asked him if he would like to be the leader on the way <br/>\nto the icecream and he said no.

Did he get lots of  undivided attention from his parents?  I think often when children are raised being told what to do and when to do it with little regard for what they want and how they feel , they do not learn to consider other peoples feeling, wants, needs, very well. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I was a bit worried about my 4 year old.....she had been in school a short time while I was having to work then i quit and we pulled the girls out, She asked permission for everything. <br/>\n  I have to admit I felt annoyed by all the can I ........questions at first. Then they changed she was no longer asking can i watch tv , or go to the bathroom its can I give you a kiss , can I pour the milk for you when I was getting a bowl of cereal. I believe she has seen me care about what she wants and thinks to ask me because maybe *I* wanted to pour my own milk :) <br/>\n  My 4 year old is very spirited and we have had this same drink problem only with a straw in sprite. Finances are very tight and I truly didnt have money to buy a new one but would have if I did .....so i removed the straw and offered a new one. This compromise was accepted and we went on with our lunch. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  In your post you said I want him to accept the things he cant change. Some things cant be changed, like the death of a relative. Getting a new milk , or a new straw and milk closed and re-open can be changed ....either by doing it yourself or persuading another to do it for you.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better Globetrotter.

He will melt over seemingly insignificant things. BUT,they are not insignificant to him. I&#39;ve been a mama for 27 years,5 children and he is by far the most emotional,sensitive child I have. <br/>\n  It may seem to the world outside that I *give in* alot. Contrary,it&#39;s not giving in,it&#39;s being mature enough myself to see my *child* having a hard time with emotions he couldn&#39;t explain if he tried(being a child) that I find the best way to help him not explode. If I see an explosion starting to brew I do whatever I can to dissuade it.<br/>\n  For instance,he wanted to wear his underwear underneath his swim trunks. My husband told him to take off his underwear,that he didn&#39;t need them with his trunks. Kenny started to cry,my husband saw that it mattered to Kenny to have his underwear on,so he said hey son,it&#39;s alright if you want to wear your underwear too,no big deal. That was it. Kenny didn&#39;t meltdown. We went to the pool and had a great time.<br/>\n  We have potential meltdowns everyday,or meltdowns period. I just go with the flow,love him,try to validate his feelings,and take nice  naps when I can so I can recharge. <br/>\n  I&#39;ve learned alot from this little guy. Mainly to be flexible in my thinking,to be more compassionate,to truly *see* through a childs eyes and heart.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Kim<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n          -=-When this happens the only thing I can do is to leave him<br/>\nalone to cool off.
