I doubt you&#39;re talking about dealing with mean teachers who put kids down without even noticing they do it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a pretty great time in school, but I remember lots of sad, bad times.  For some reason you have your daughter at home, so move toward what you envision, don&#39;t envision back toward school as an ideal.  It will always be there if you change your mind, but try the non-school world fully before you think school could do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep away from the school. If you can still see it out of the corner of your eye, you&#39;re too close.  If you&#39;re still comparing her to your mind&#39;s eye&#39;s image of a perfect schoolkid, you&#39;re still too close.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":177721839,"authorName":"Angela S","from":"&quot;Angela S&quot; &lt;game-enthusiast@...&gt;","profile":"autonomousangela","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] home schooling","postDate":"1108817711","msgId":21819,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDUwMjE5MTI1NTA3LklSVVQyNjcyOC5tdGE5LmFkZWxwaGlhLm5ldEBsZWlnaD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGN2NTMwNitqMGUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21818,"nextInTopic":21821,"prevInTime":21818,"nextInTime":21820,"topicId":21818,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" If *she* feels she is needing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-13636614\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been schooling my 8-yearold at home, but I feel she&#39;s missing <br/>\nout on the social aspects of school.
