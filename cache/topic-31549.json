Vaguely I had thoughts like  <br/>\nmaybe their moms helped them, or they were just some kind of language  <br/>\nprodigies, or just quick at whatever all reading took.

A child who &quot;can read&quot;  <br/>\nmight not be reading really fluently and that will relegate him to  <br/>\neasy books, or to reading slowly and painstakingly.   Kids in school  <br/>\nreported the same thing; I remember it myself.  When my mom read to  <br/>\nme it was Winnie the Pooh, Uncle Remus and poetry.  I wish she&#39;d read  <br/>\nway more but we didn&#39;t have any books.   When I came home with A&#39;s in  <br/>\nreading, it all ended, and I was stuck with my schoolbooks and  <br/>\n&quot;Little Golden Books&quot; (some weren&#39;t bad, but still they were short  <br/>\nand for kids) and comic books (one a week if I was lucky).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids didn&#39;t start reading phonetically, or maybe I didn&#39;t call  <br/>\nphonetic stumbling &quot;reading.&quot;  School does.  It misleads everyone  <br/>\ninvolved.  Even &quot;the good readers&quot; feel there&#39;s something wrong when  <br/>\nthe teacher says &quot;you can read&quot; but there are words all around them  <br/>\nthey can&#39;t read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids could read, all words looked legible.
