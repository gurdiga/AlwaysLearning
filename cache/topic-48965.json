I ve been thinking about the description of your son a lot because he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1775701808\">I know this topic is kind of old, so I hope my responding now will still be useful.  I&#39;ve been thinking about the description of your son a lot because he sounds very similar to my brother.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my brother was only a toddler, he managed to climb on top of the roof (without a ladder).  When my mom and uncle heard him up there, they walked outside, and my uncle turned around just as he said, &quot;Uncle Tommy, catch!&quot;  Then he jumped.  Luckily he WAS caught.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe also ran through a sliding glass door 3 different times in 3 different houses.  The first time nearly killed him because there was no safety glass.  He was 4, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots more examples I could give from his childhood, but my point is that he had extremely high levels of energy and curiosity, and somewhat lower levels of empathy and impulse control than my other brother and me.  He did poorly at school, even though he was smart.  He was always getting into some kind of trouble, and finally, as a young adult, he ended up in prison for about a year.  It wasn&#39;t until then that he decided to do something constructive with his life.  I&#39;m happy to say that nowadays he works as a diver and underwater welder, which suits him perfectly because it&#39;s a dangerous and physically demanding job.  But even though he&#39;s 41 now, he still tends to get into trouble if work isn&#39;t keeping him busy enough (crashing his dirt bike, etc.).  He told me recently that he gets nervous when he sits for too long.  Even now he needs more stimulation and physical activity than the rest of us.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease understand that I&#39;m not suggesting your son could be headed for prison.  But I&#39;ve been wondering about my brother my whole life.  <br/>\nWhen I was young, I thought he was just a bad kid.  As I got older, I realized that he was internally driven to use his body and mind in very active, intense ways, and I saw that really, he had some good qualities, and I began to wonder what my mom could have done differently (and what any parent could do) to prevent the trouble he got into.  Here are my theories, for what they are worth:  1)Try to understand what his physical and other needs really are, and do your best to meet them.  In other words, my brother needed to be physically and mentally challenged, much more so than any other person I&#39;ve ever known, and he needed to have his energies channeled in positive directions.  He was the school chess champion in sixth grade.  What if my mom had found a chess club or just some other people he couldn&#39;t beat, and he had to work at that?  Might that have kept him out of trouble for a while?  2)Don&#39;t expect him to be as compliant as other kids.  If there&#39;s something he must not do, try to keep him away from that thing.  3) Help him to see how his actions affect others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling is THE way to go with kids like my brother.  I wish he had had the same opportunity your son has, I applaud you for doing the extra work of attending to his needs, and I beg you to get as much support and rest as you can.  I think your job is more difficult than the average parent&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":352545834,"authorName":"tiffermom@comcast.net","from":"tiffermom@...","profile":"tiffermomof5","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: struggles of will","postDate":"1260246853","msgId":49028,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk0MzkzMzIwMS4yMzQ4MTUxMjYwMjQ2ODUzMzY4LkphdmFNYWlsLnJvb3RAc3owMDM5YS5lbWVyeXZpbGxlLmNhLm1haWwuY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1QTFEMkYxLTU1MDQtNDg3OS04RDc3LTEwMkM2MUI0QzBGNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49022,"nextInTopic":49269,"prevInTime":49027,"nextInTime":49029,"topicId":48965,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"While reading this thread I was thinking how dangerous is the shed?

I do not think he will fall or get hurt. My concern is more that I do not want him to damage my paint or window wipers. It is my car and I like it and do not want it damaged. That is what I tell him. Telling him it is dangerous probably would not make much sense to him. Especially after successfully climbing on it already. Potentially damaging it makes sense to him because we have already had to repair a broken windshield wiper. Maybe stop telling him it is dangerous and tell him why YOU do not want him to climb on it other then the danger. <br/>\n<br/>\nTiffani <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, December 7, 2009 4:54:44 PM GMT -08:00 US/Canada Pacific <br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: struggles of will <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I felt like i was only a obligation of politeness to her when she <br/>\nwas telling me this because her husband and son was working on our <br/>\nbathroom...for free. so i didn&#39;t say anything.

Just now I remembered something my father and I used to do when I was about 5 years old: He used to take me to the train tracks in the local town, where there were boxcars on a side track. We would both climb the ladder on the side of the boxcars onto the roof of the boxcar. That&#39;s very high up! Then he would help me to jump from boxcar to boxcar along the top of the cars (He was really supervising us during this part). Now, my mother would have never done anything like this with me because it would have scared her too much. But now that I&#39;m reflecting on it, my relationship with my father was a million times better than with my mother. I really trusted him, and more importantly, he trusted me back.

I have never heard of two children that sound so much alike.<br/>\nHe is also 8 years old.<br/>\nFortunately my sister has been pulled him out of school  August of last year and has been unschooling him since then. <br/>\nShe reads this list but does not post. She loves the advice here and Sandra and has &quot;stolen&quot; my book Moving a Puddle  before I could read it all myself - hey Bella I need it back!<br/>\nAnyways back  to our feature presentation...&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>\nPatrick is a super smart, sensitive, energetic, physical, don&#39;t-try-to-boss-me-around-or-control-me sweet kid.<br/>\nNeedles to say school was NOT good for him and in a coupoe weeks in first grade they wanted him on medication.<br/>\nI am going to write some observations I have made of him.<br/>\nWhat I have noticed is that he likes to be in charge, he is very curious and he needs a lot of physical activities and a lot of my sister presence to facilitate in certain situations.<br/>\nHe is at the same time very sensitive and polite but when he is frustrated with something or not feeling heard he can call my sister names.<br/>\nHe is impulsive but that has really improved in the last year.<br/>\nShe keeps him out of situations that are too hard for him too handle. <br/>\nShe is really careful not to take him places she knows he cannot handle or he would be bored with.<br/>\nHe has a need to know everything that is going on. So if something was being done in the bathroom she would have asked the guys to show him and maybe taken him out to a park or somewhere else if it was needed.<br/>\nBut usually once his curiosity is satiated then he moves on.<br/>\nShe has a trampoline in her living room. She buys toys on yard sales, thrift stores or dollar stores so if they break its not a big deal.<br/>\nHe is a dare devil and very physical. He masters difficult physical challenges easy. Since he was little he would be climbing on stuff and he was told a lot to come down that it was dangerous. He figured out they were wrong and ALWAYS did it anyway.  They have somewhat relaxed about it and he has also not tried to find more crazy things to do once they relaxed. They have built a &quot; fort/tree house/club house for him in the backyard and she takes him to the park a lot weather permitting. He still needs lots of things to do physically.<br/>\nHe hates feeling controlled or bossed around.<br/>\nAn example of how I deal with him is this: There were a group of kids here playing and they were starting to get rough with some of our toys ( Patrick really likes to bang and brake things) so I walked in and told everyone not to do it and or to go play with something else . I knew Patrick was the one who started it but I called him and asked him if he could please keep and eye so that no one was banging the toys. I asked him to watch and come get me if needed . He loves to be the one  that is &quot;trusted&quot; to do things like that. He was great. <br/>\nHe will play with my 3 year old daughter so gentle and nice but he and my son fight a lot so I need to be there with them. <br/>\nMy sister keeps playdates short. When kids start fightin its time to go home for her or me when visiting.<br/>\nSometimes they can play well for hours , something after just 30 minutes it is time to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Robyn  about facitlitating and keeping him out of situations that he would not do well.<br/>\nMaybe my sister will chime in but with Patrick and another younger boy I doubt she has much time to write at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

Long time since i posted. There are some things going on that i need help with and the best way for me is to write it as it happened.  many probably remember my son Lukas,is(8yo.)<br/>\nWe are still having a hard time getting him to stop doing certain things that are dangerous or a problem. Like the other day,workers were in our bathroom and he wanted to go in there. We told to he can&#39;t,lets do something or watch from over here. He went in. We told him to come out. He said no. We said he needs to get out of there,they are sawing and there&#39;s no room for him plus it&#39;s not safe. He came out  yelling mommy&#39;s mean to me! The guy in the bathroom said&quot;listen to your mom!&quot; We told him before they started working not to go in there. Then a women friend(who was here too) said to me&quot;Heather,if there isn&#39;t that parental authority now when he is a teenager and has that young man strength,you will have no control&quot; so,I look bad to these people and i get a free traditional,mainstream, parenting lecture. It looks really bad for me when people are here. I don&#39;t get why he isn&#39;t as nice as he is when we are alone. I don&#39;t think i treat him any different,maybe i&#39;m wrong but can&#39;t see how,maybe you can help.<br/>\nHe acts like a rebel when company is here and i can&#39;t figure out why. I pay just as much attention to him,show him affection,respect him but all hell breaks loose.<br/>\nThen there is the climbing on the truck top and the shed. We don&#39;t want him on either. He refuses to stay off them! I did the explaining thing,danger talk,that didn&#39;t stop him. One day with my sciatica pain and all,I removed all the stuff he was using to get on the shed,i threw the wheelbarrow on top,the bins,all of it! He found a cooler to stand on! Every time he goes outside i find him on top of the shed...doing a dance sometimes! Of course i offered lots of other things to climb on,what am i supposed to do? Not let him go outside if he goes on it? Isn&#39;t that a punishment? I have gone out there with him and said very sternly:Get off the shed! Do not go on it!<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t do any good. Sandra once said maybe i wasn&#39;t talking firm enough but believe me,I have been lately to no avail.<br/>\nWhen those people were here Lukas also said some not too nice things,he said he wished i were dead.(because he couldn&#39;t get his way being in the bathroom) and curse words.So you can see how bad this looks about us and more important how we need to fix these things in our relationship.<br/>\nHeather</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49237,"nextTopicId":49275}}
