I made SURE I had a date and <br/>\nstayed out until 11:59:59.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was stupid.  I was only doing the make-up because I had waited so long for <br/>\nthis rite of passage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we let Holly dress however, get her ears pierced, wear make-up, do <br/>\nwhatever to her hair, and so she&#39;s doing all the freaky weird stuff as a cute little <br/>\ngirl, and by the time she&#39;s of that more dangerous age, she&#39;ll either have it <br/>\nsomewhat out of her system or she&#39;ll be really artsy with it, one or the <br/>\nother. &lt;g&gt;  Probably some of both.

I did mine on and off for the last 3 <br/>\nyears. It felt weird the first time and I got a few looks in the street <br/>\nespecially as I wear combat trousers, t-shirts with skulls on and <br/>\nassorted jewellry. When I arrived in Virginia I had pink spiky hair. <br/>\nThen I shaved most of it off after seeing Tank Girl, then let it grow <br/>\nagain. My Mother in Law keeps hinting I should settle down now I&#39;m <br/>\n35.....usually that makes me go do soemthing spiky and colourful again :-)<br/>\nNow I&#39;m feeling boring again. I had the sides shaved but the top is now <br/>\nlong enough to cover it and I feel like Stepford mum.<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m 106 I&#39;ll get that denim jumper.....<br/>\n<br/>\nShyrley</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154033277,"authorName":"crystal.pina","from":"&quot;crystal.pina&quot; &lt;crystal.pina@...&gt;","profile":"crystalinma","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Mom&#39;s dressing funky","postDate":"1063808603","msgId":16327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWMzN2QyNyQ0MGZmZDM1MCQwMGMxZmVhOUBTRVlNT1VSQlVUVFM+","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTE3LjA3MTY1Ni4xNTAxNC4xNTQ3MDBAd2VibWFpbDA1Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16326,"nextInTopic":16328,"prevInTime":16326,"nextInTime":16328,"topicId":16326,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My favorite doctor was the doctor I had when I was pregnant with my first 2 boys.
