For a bit it looked like he was going to two of <br/>\nthem, and he reserved a tux for two weekends, but he&#39;s down to just one prom. <br/>\n Los Alamos High (90 miles away), so not convenient.  But the good news is he <br/>\nsaves over $100 by not taking his now-former girlfriend to her high school&#39;s <br/>\nprom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13913,"nextTopicId":13915}}
