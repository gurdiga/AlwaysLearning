He keeps asking me<br/>\nto look up more that I don&#39;t think could exist but they then there<br/>\nthey are when I look them up. Ha. They are stories built on stories,<br/>\nand this leads to fanfic which I have spent tons of time reading to<br/>\nKarl. Last night, he came and got me to watch a Bakugan episode with<br/>\nhim, in which a grown son went back in time to play Bakugan with his<br/>\nmother when she was a very young child. I wish I could have heard all<br/>\nthat was said but even pictorially it was something to see the<br/>\ncharacter spending this time with his mom, and the game was a way to<br/>\nunderstand even more someone who he missed. It was more than just a<br/>\ngame. It was more than neat that Karl especially asked me to watch<br/>\nthat with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have watched House only like one episode worth and I found myself<br/>\nwondering if the things that were happening could really happen in<br/>\nreal life, and yes they do.
