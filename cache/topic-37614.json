J&#39;s <br/>\nreading skills are not up there yet but he does his best.  I just nod <br/>\nif I am in the room, or help alittle if he seems to want me to but for <br/>\nthe most part he remembers the story.   I have mentioned here before <br/>\nthat his younger brother can read pretty well and J is beginning to <br/>\nnotice this.  I can see it in his face.  He has actually quit trying <br/>\nto read as his brother has improved.  B reads to me quite often and J <br/>\nhears him.  I have noticed the past few nights when I asked J is he <br/>\nwanted to read to the kids that he would say yes, but then change his <br/>\nmind and say something like, &quot;no my throat kind of hurts tonight&quot;. or <br/>\nlast night he said he couldnt see so well cause his glasses are <br/>\nbroken.  I just nod and go read to the kids.  Today, he came to me and <br/>\nasked if I would write someone a note, and another time asked if I <br/>\nwould read something for him, &quot;because he isnt good a reading yet&quot;.  I <br/>\nguess I just wonder if I should say anything to him about what might <br/>\nbe bothering him or just wait and see if he brings it up.  For the <br/>\nmost part he is happy, he has his things he feels he is good at, but I <br/>\nknow it bothers him sometimes.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37582,"nextTopicId":37616}}
