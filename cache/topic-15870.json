Cool,  I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy other dd, Abbi(8),  said  something along those lines.

There is some deductive reasoning in playing it because<br/>\nat some points you know what cards you have but you don&#39;t know where they<br/>\nare, cause you mix them.  And then you get rid of some and you could keep<br/>\ntrack of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbbi and I just got done playing a round of it and we started talking about<br/>\npercentages/probability.   &quot;I have 50% chance of getting a card that matches<br/>\nyours because I have 4 cards and I know 2 are the same as yours.&quot;   Then on<br/>\nto 66% chance.

Its called Mystery.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t really thought a whole lot about it.  Well,  the other day she comes and asks me if I&#39;d like to play.  &quot;Sure!&quot;  I say.  So we sit down and she deals out 7 cards to each and says not to look at them.  She then puts the pile of remaining cards in the middle, facing up.   She says we can&#39;t look out our own cards but we have to hold them up so the other person can see them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you play kind-of like Go Fish.  Look at the other persons&#39; hand,  are there any pairs? If there are you get to take them for a point.  Then next, you pick a card out of your own hand, still can&#39;t look at your hand.  Look at the one you picked, does it match with any in your opponent&#39;s hand?  If it does you take the one out of the opponent&#39;s hand,  if not put it back and draw the top card off the pile.   It is now the next person&#39;s turn.  You keep doing this until someone runs out of cards,  then the game is done.   If you are left with cards in your hand you have to deduct pairs from your collection.   Then, the person with the most pairs wins! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was pretty fun,  I thought it was just a little step up from Go Fish as far as challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you believe my little 6 year old thought this up??<br/>\n<br/>\nIts so funny we keep saying,  &quot;you can&#39;t look at the card,  that&#39;s why its called A Mystery!&quot; &lt;g&gt; Like a commercial or something!<br/>\n<br/>\nKids are amazing.
