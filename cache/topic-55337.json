Mostly, he<br/>\nrubs his eyes, but sometimes he will yawn if he&#39;s very sleepy. Or he may<br/>\nstart &#39;drooping&#39;. That is bedtime. If he&#39;s on his belly, he will simply drop<br/>\nhis head, stick his thumb in his mouth and sleep right there.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe sleeps late and wakes up early and has a few naps in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes he has trouble falling asleep, and he &#39;stalls&#39;. He will rub his<br/>\neyes, get sleepier, fussier or even start crying but not sleep. So I check<br/>\nfor comfort. Sometimes I can&#39;t figure it out, or fix it (poop due soon).<br/>\nEven a brief change in position and back &#39;restarts a stalled routine&#39;. I<br/>\nhave found it useful to have several different &#39;routines&#39;. I have found that<br/>\ndifferent things fit on different days, but its helps to have some idea of<br/>\nwhat I will do even if its a simple pick and cuddle or let him sleep where<br/>\nhe is. So in that sense its not totally free style, though its flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the most important thing is to recognize when he&#39;s sleepy and what helps<br/>\nhim nod off and what interferes. For example, N will wake up if I play<br/>\n&#39;soothing music&#39; as he is just drifting off, but he can sleep in bright<br/>\nlight, no problem.

When we get yes or no questions from our children we have trained ourselves to stop and think - why not yes.  I don&#39;t know why it is so hard to apply this to all avenues of parenting.  For us it feels easy to just step back into what we were used to growing up (habits ingrained in us).  Bedtime is just another one of those habits we went with because in all honesty, even though it wasn&#39;t working, it seemed easier because we didn&#39;t have to think about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe forging ahead without a living breathing elder or peer in our families to turn to who truly get it is challenging.  I am not sure if it is just the stage in our lives as parents or if we are just in a rut.  We didn&#39;t seem to have this problem with extended breastfeeding or attachment parenting or co-sleeping I don&#39;t know why we have lost that gumption to keeping facilitating that same way of thinking as parents now.<br/>\n<br/>\nBreathing, thinking, trying and observing is on my to do list again!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] No bedtime","postDate":"1277689546","msgId":55351,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZEN0E3NDNELUNDNEEtNDcxNS04M0Q2LTgxRjZBQkVEODQ0N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDYyMUUwOUQ1LTE5RTYtNDQ4Qy04MTM1LTUyOTI3Q0E0MzQ3MUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGkwN3RsdCt1MDg4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjIxRTA5RDUtMTlFNi00NDhDLTgxMzUtNTI5MjdDQTQzNDcxQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":55350,"nextInTopic":55355,"prevInTime":55350,"nextInTime":55352,"topicId":55337,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-No bedtimes has never been seriously suggested on any list I ve been on and yet lots of people label the concept like that.

The <br/>\npoint is not to go to bed. The point is to get enough sleep to feel good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  In my family, that meant that I watched for signs of sleepiness in <br/>\neach kid -- and each was different. When I started seeing signs of <br/>\nsleepiness coming, I&#39;d start toning down the activity level in the <br/>\nhouse. I&#39;d lower lights (love the dimmer switch) and I&#39;d turn down the <br/>\nsound on the tv. I might call the sleepy one into another room and <br/>\ncuddle up and read to her. I might run a bath for her. I might say, <br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s have just candles and tell stories.&quot; I might put on a movie that <br/>\nthe kids love, but have seen many times, so tht would free up the sleepy <br/>\nones to conk out. I might bring out some blankets and pillows for the <br/>\nliving room floor. I might just pick up the sleepy one and hug her on my <br/>\nlap and stroke her cheek or hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, in my house, I was the one taking the lead.

If they notice that <br/>\nyou&#39;ve let usual bedtime slip by, just ask, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;  Let it <br/>\nstay that way until everybody has just forgotten that bedtime used to be <br/>\nspecific time and has adjusted to it being when they feel sleepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid is clearly sleepy, but not admitting it, then just tone things <br/>\ndown. Calm and quiet time is conducive to sleep. Rosie pretty much <br/>\nalways fell asleep in the middle of the rest of the family still up and <br/>\nbusy. She still falls asleep in the living room, quite often.
