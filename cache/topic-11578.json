The workshop was totally hands-on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Engineering thing was taught by a cool many who LOVED all the cool <br/>\nplastics machines that had been donated. My son had his sneaker <br/>\nshrink-wrapped (a good thing in the case of my son&#39;s smelly sneaker), and we <br/>\nhad a mission to use heat guns and plastics to engineer a bottle.
