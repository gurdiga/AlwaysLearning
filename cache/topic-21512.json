I just went through<br/>\nthis last week with &#39;Bye Bye Bye&#39; my son will play one song over and over<br/>\nagain till he feels had has enough of it, then will start all over again. It<br/>\nis coming up to an hour for Raven&#39;s &#39;Grazing in the Grass&#39; song, he says it<br/>\nis hard to picture her singing that song, he keeps seeing meercats singing<br/>\nit.<br/>\nI didn&#39;t realize, till I noticed him doing it, that I do the same exact<br/>\nthing, although I use headphones. I usually do that to help get me through<br/>\ncleaning (I really do not like doing dishes) - that definitely goes back to<br/>\nwhen I was a kid, could not listen to music while doing chores. hmmm, or<br/>\npretty much anytime for that matter.

I eat way too much and just feel<br/>\nlousy. My son has really made it quite memorable for me this time though, he<br/>\nhas been giving me pointers on how to play the different classes on Star<br/>\nWars Battlefront on x-box. I started off in the Ladybug (novice) level of<br/>\nknowledge and now I am at the Butterfly level, very soon he says I will make<br/>\nthe Black Widow level. Final test of my abilities, he says, is to go up<br/>\nagainst him, yikes! he is REALLY good! lol<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw the sun today - I have not seen that since Christmas eve. Boy, when<br/>\nour town does cloudy, it really goes all out! We have had a snow storm, icy<br/>\nrain, flooding and rain, rain, rain! yuck!<br/>\nWe had a power outage last week, from like 9pm to 4am - thankfully it stayed<br/>\nabove freezing that night. We read from a strategy guide (we had an oil lamp<br/>\non) brought out the emergency radio, listened to a Jon Anderson interview,<br/>\nplayed with candle wax for hours, found the &#39;80s station (my son asked how<br/>\non earth did I know all the songs that came on). When the &#39;Eye of the Tiger&#39;<br/>\ncame on he said he knew that song - he remembered &#39;The Rye or the Kaiser&#39; by<br/>\nWeird Al, lol.
