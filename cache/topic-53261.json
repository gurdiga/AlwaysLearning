What I have only now realised is that this is<br/>\n&gt; indicative of how extraordinarily difficult I have found it to think<br/>\n&gt; for myself. I am so used to being spoonfed the &quot;right answer&quot; that<br/>\n&gt; even now, in my forties, I sort of wait for someone to tell me what to<br/>\n&gt; do. -=-<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re describing is unusual at all, though.<br/>\n&gt; People have voices in their heads, and they have the images of people<br/>\n&gt; whose approval would make them feel better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Knowing I&#39;m in control of those voices (I found volume!) and that I am the<br/>\none who can shape the things said to me *inside my OWN head* are very<br/>\nimportant day-to-day tools.  You can fire the voices you no longer agree<br/>\nwith. Crazy but TRUE ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to &quot;bring in&quot; Sandra to virtually sit in the corner of the room while<br/>\nI played with my kids. She would *in my head* watch and approve of the<br/>\ninteractions.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I heard her voice IRL and listened to Parenting Peacefully about 857<br/>\ntimes, she moved from the corner of the room to the head of the choir!<br/>\nSlowly, slowly through the years, I&#39;ve collected the voices of the moms I<br/>\nwant most to be like (and lucky us, there are lots of &#39;em here!) and allowed<br/>\nthem to speak to me in ways I&#39;d never heard before!  While waiting for that<br/>\nnext, better option (a PP tool), I&#39;ll poll my mental-mamas for suggestions.<br/>\n(hmmm, I&#39;ve not used this lately, perhaps this is a reminder to me more than<br/>\nany of the general you ;))<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have TONS of people in my head.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My dad&#39;s voice *in my head* was incredibly critical, though he&#39;d not spoken<br/>\nthat way (to me or anyone else) in over 25 years. I&#39;ve incorporated a lot of<br/>\nNew Dad-isms, while finding humor (instead of shame or pain) in the Old<br/>\nDad-isms.  i.e. He used to say, &quot;If you had any brains, you&#39;d take &#39;em out<br/>\nand play with &#39;em!&quot; Part of me remembers the insult, while there&#39;s a part of<br/>\nme that remembers how I would internally smile and think, &quot;At least I&#39;d have<br/>\nsomething to PLAY with!&quot; Today, my dad would laugh at my thought, he<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have then. Imagining us laughing together is a better thought to<br/>\ncarry than the insult. As an unschooling mommy, I can&#39;t imagine the pain<br/>\nlittle-boy-Ed felt about having things said to him. I know Papa Ed<br/>\nappreciates seeing it not happen to his grandson.  So changing those old<br/>\nvoices, improves the now relations.  And no one outside your mind need know<br/>\nhow it was done! :D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have Holly in my head when I want to buy something that I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really need. Darn that Holly.<br/>\n&gt; __<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My most favorite Holly-ism:<br/>\n&quot;Does that need to be heard?&quot;<br/>\nI didn&#39;t imagine this could be said in a non-snarky way - IT CAN!  With a<br/>\ngenuine concern to make life better, it can, it was.<br/>\nIn that gap between getting riled up and taking that deep breath to begin to<br/>\nspew, in comes Holly&#39;s voice & I&#39;m deflated like a balloon. I step back and<br/>\nexamine what I&#39;m about to say; I can still say it in 38 seconds if it&#39;s<br/>\ndeemed worthy of being heard.  78.53% of the time (scientifically) the<br/>\nthought doesn&#39;t need to leave me; the rest of the time, the editing option<br/>\nshould still be used ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.wordpress.com<br/>\nhannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53249,"nextTopicId":53209}}
