The real question, I suppose is whether he/she will notice <br/>\n&gt; the oily sheen on the top of the water refracting the light into <br/>\n&gt; rainbows, or the bugs walking ever so delicately on the surface <br/>\n&gt; tension,, or the little plant growing just under the place where the <br/>\n&gt; water has managed to rust through and slowly drips out, or the way <br/>\n&gt; the welding was done on the trough, or how if his/her nose is under <br/>\n&gt; the water when he/she exhales bubbles are made, or the bird flying <br/>\n&gt; overhead and the cool way its poop drifts down, faster than it looks <br/>\n&gt; like it should, but still responding to the wind.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem with unschooling is that it isn&#39;t a means to an end.  If <br/>\n&gt; you unschool you aren&#39;t doing it so that your children will read and <br/>\n&gt; write.  You aren&#39;t doing it so that they will eventually learn to <br/>\n&gt; turn off the television on their own.  You are doing it because the <br/>\n&gt; process is more important than the end.  Or because unschooling is <br/>\n&gt; the end and the beginning and the whole shebang.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I don&#39;t know how it is possible to prevent people from believing <br/>\n&gt; that unschooling is a means to an end.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6581,"nextTopicId":6594}}
