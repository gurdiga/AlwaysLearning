It comes along with her support if she feels strongly enough about<br/>\nthe subject. So when I told her we were homeschooling she thought Matthew<br/>\nwould end up smart enough - but how would he learn to deal with difficult<br/>\npeople and function in a group and be able to work all the jerks he will end<br/>\nup working with professionally? I tried all my discussion and persuasion<br/>\ntechniques to help her see that we were all going to be better people going<br/>\nthis route. Discussion would go back and forth but I&#39;ve known that it was a<br/>\nserious worry to her. It even broke down at one point where, in a<br/>\ndiscussion, as heated as they get with her, I said that I should send him to<br/>\nprison to see to her concerns.  So I just stopped talking with her about<br/>\nthat particular aspect of Matthew&#39;s development.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started discussing Unschooling concepts I could see that same worried<br/>\ntension behind her eyes. I knew this was too big a jump for her to make. So<br/>\nI backed off and have never gotten to discuss or explain our motivations for<br/>\ntaking this path.   She was very concerned when he wasn&#39;t reading at age<br/>\nten. And questioned &quot;how does he learn History?&quot; - Knowing that it was never<br/>\na subject I excelled at in public school. [And perhaps leading me to infer<br/>\n&quot;who would study history if there wasn&#39;t a class requiring it.&quot;]<br/>\n<br/>\nMatthew is now 13 years old.  He can sit down with a novel and not look up<br/>\nuntil it&#39;s done.  He practically begs me to read history books to him<br/>\nbecause it&#39;s interesting and a fun thing we do together.  Most importantly,<br/>\nhe has grown into being a pleasant person who is sensitive and can deal with<br/>\ndifficult people on his own, something he has proven to my mother during<br/>\ndiscussion with my father.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was driving my mother home from a doctor&#39;s appointment.  I had a<br/>\nprintout of an article that Sandra had posted here about a month ago called<br/>\n&quot;Let&#39;s work to stop snuffing out the joys of learning &quot; by Andrew Hanson.<br/>\nThe article talks about the damage formal schooling does to the passion for<br/>\nlearning through study. It describes how formal schooling changes the active<br/>\nlearners we all are at the start of our lives, into passive, disinterested,<br/>\nlearners.  I had passed it around our Park day group and it was still in my<br/>\ncar.  I don&#39;t normally pass on information that blatantly bashes schooling<br/>\nto my mother who retired from the Los Angeles city school district a few<br/>\nyears back.  But this article was written by a teacher, a Fulbright Exchange<br/>\nTeacher, and touches on many key concepts of unschooling. And I thought<br/>\nmaybe she could see that Jocelyn and I (and Unschooling) are part of the<br/>\nrevolution of schooling Hanson calls for. And that the outcomes are clearly<br/>\nillustrated in her grandson...        So I asked her if she wanted to read<br/>\nany more homeschooling propaganda. And she replied &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think I need<br/>\nany more propaganda, I am already convinced that you&#39;ve made the right<br/>\nchoice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Well, knock me over with a feather.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7815,"nextTopicId":7799}}
