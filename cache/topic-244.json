I wasn&#39;t being mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nMean humor, insults and sarcasm are rare at our house.  The light sarcasm <br/>\nthat&#39;s more in the line of puns or tongue-in-cheek is done, but not joking at <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s expense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone is sad or worried or in no joking mood, we&#39;ll be serious with that <br/>\nperson, but the default communications-set involves humor and music.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":206,"nextTopicId":246}}
