Now *usually* this issue comes up from<br/>\nenglish to italian: english has to be one of the most expressive<br/>\nlanguages adjective and adverbial wise...in italian I am always at a<br/>\nloss as how to translate certain nuances, if they are important i need<br/>\nto add a whole new phrase to capture the idea (making an already wordy<br/>\nlanguage wordier!)  This is the first time I was stumped by having too<br/>\nmany choices in italian, and only one to choose from in english...<br/>\n<br/>\nmust have been because we are talking about holidays, lol.  Italians<br/>\nlove to celebrate!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the plainest day would be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so keep my &quot;giorno&quot; substitution for &quot;giornata&quot;...its more<br/>\nserious, keeping in line with the effort we all will have to put out,<br/>\nand most likely fail at, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And don&#39;t use &quot;unschooling&quot; if you don&#39;t want to.

I<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking along the lines of &quot;those who practice the homeschooling<br/>\nphilosophy of natural learning&quot;...it sounds unwieldy in english but<br/>\nactually in italian, it works.  Italians love wordy bureoucratic<br/>\nlanguage, lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nthough this is for a page like this one about the learn nothing day.<br/>\nUsually while translating I could just refer to &quot;natural learning&quot; as<br/>\nthe definition would be reassumed at the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is some discussion on a French site about what to call it in  <br/>\n&gt; French.
