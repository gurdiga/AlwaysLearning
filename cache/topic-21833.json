Another way to look at it is<br/>\nyou&#39;ve given them an opportunity to make the next move.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf and when they are the least big critical or ask what would be a stupid<br/>\nquestion (meaning if they had done their reading they would have the<br/>\nanswer), you can say &quot;Did you read the book I gave you?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the answer is no, you can say, &quot;After you read that, we could talk about<br/>\nit some more.&quot;   The unstated other side of that chesspiece is &quot;until you<br/>\nread about it, it is not my move, and any other moves you make are<br/>\ncheating.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Sandra!  I loved your response.  For two reasons:  The first being it<br/>\nwas a great pat on the back. :)  It is always good to hear when you&#39;ve done<br/>\nsomething good.  The second:  You are absolutely right about answering their<br/>\nquestions.  I have told my mother more than a dozen or so times when she<br/>\nstarts in on me that until she chooses to understand what we are doing there<br/>\nis no reason to continue our conversation.  I have also expressed that I do<br/>\nnot want to hear them &quot;quiz&quot; my girls on anything.  My mother is a retired<br/>\nschool teacher and we have regular rounds with this stuff.  I love the part<br/>\nof your response when you said &quot;it is not my move and any other moves you<br/>\nmake are cheating!&quot;  I am going to remember this one for the next time she<br/>\nwants converse!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Tracey - Happily unschooling in S.C.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nInternal Virus Database is out-of-date.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.300 / Virus Database: 265.8.8 - Release Date: 2/14/2005</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21769,"nextTopicId":21822}}
