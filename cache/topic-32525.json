I would unschool  <br/>\n&gt; if every other person on the planet put their kids in school  <br/>\n&gt; tomorrow.  I don&#39;t need people to agree with me to feel whole and  <br/>\n&gt; right.  Apparently some people&#39;s mental health hinges on whether a  <br/>\n&gt; post goes through to a list or not.  I suppose there must be a few  <br/>\n&gt; million Yahoo groups by now.

People are bringing  <br/>\n&gt; stories.  I have books out.  Holly and I have shopped and cooked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Marty and Holly will be in on this discussion.  There will be ten or  <br/>\n&gt; twelve people altogether.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Later or tomorrow Holly and I are going to finish a Roman costume for  <br/>\n&gt; her because Friday night she&#39;s going to a history of Italy party.
