I think your post was a broad <br/>\ninsult to everyone who read yesterday and didn&#39;t post.  If that wasn&#39;t <br/>\nyour intention, then I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d clarify what the above <br/>\npost meant.<br/>\n<br/>\n(At this point, the water is pretty cloudy and I have no idea what <br/>\n&quot;challenging concept to the status quo about &quot;unschoolers&quot; succumbing to <br/>\nschool you are talking about.

Do some of you disagree <br/>\nwith that approach?<br/>\n<br/>\nPPS (Now that I have gone back and re-read in the archives, I can say <br/>\nthat I agreed with your post on Saturday that it would be desireable to <br/>\nmeet a child&#39;s needs by enhancing community.

I know when we  first <br/>\nconsidered homeschooling here in NC, I didn&#39;t have to register with the  state <br/>\nuntil my oldest was 7 so I really didn&#39;t think about it until then.   But at <br/>\nthat point DH and I had decided that we didn&#39;t want to change anything  about <br/>\nour lives, no curriculum, no school-at-home etc.  We wanted to  continue <br/>\nliving life. <br/>\n <br/>\nI was at that time reading HEM and was so drawn to Sandra&#39;s column.   And <br/>\nthat was all I knew about her.  I was not on any yahoo lists and had  never seen <br/>\nher web site.  Wasn&#39;t really online much at all.  But when  I started <br/>\nsearching the Internet and ran across Kelly&#39;s site for the SOS group  and saw the Live <br/>\nand Learn Conference (of course I didn&#39;t know it was the first  one..LOL) <br/>\nthat was what I saw, Sandra.  I told Jackson, DH, that I didn&#39;t  know any <br/>\nunschoolers, and didn&#39;t know anyone going to the conference, but I did  recognize <br/>\nSandra&#39;s name from HEM.  We talked about going and took the  plunge and had a <br/>\ngreat time and came away knowing that we were unschoolers, it  had a name and <br/>\nfrom there I went online and joined lists, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\nNow some 3 years later I have the North Carolina Unschoolers list and web  <br/>\nsite and plan get togethers for unschoolers all the time.  It has really  snow <br/>\nballed but it started with HEM and the little SOS group.<br/>\n <br/>\nI am not sure Helen realizes how many people were affected by that  column.  <br/>\nIt is not just people searching for writings by Sandra.  But  maybe Helen does <br/>\nrealize that and it is not the slant that HEM wants to  take.  Anyway it is a <br/>\nloss for the unschooling community but maybe the Live  Free Learn Free <br/>\nmagazine will fill that a little.

As an unschooling mom,  I really felt a connection with that column and now..... not much there for me. With the other articles and columns in HEM,  I would be thinking,  &quot;yeah, this is kind-of like me&quot;.  But they were never on target.   They were either too controlling or too schooly.   The reason I started home educating my children was to get away from that.  That didn&#39;t work so why would I replicate that? Sandra&#39;s column was like a breath of fresh air.  It really spoke to me in a way that the others never did.   I saw that Sandra&#39;s focus was her children and their relationship.  Not what her children needed to know.  The focus wasn&#39;t on what the parent thought the child should learn, it was on what the child thought he or she should learn.  Isn&#39;t that how we all learn best anyway?  When we&#39;re doing what we want,  when we&#39;re following our own passions and dreams?   I<br/>\n don&#39;t see that in the other articles/columns.  I&#39;m sorry to see your magazine going in this direction. I won&#39;t be renewing my subscription.  Kelli Traaseth,  unschooling mom to 3<br/>\n*****************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI know HEM wasn&#39;t ever very &#39;unschooly&#39; but it sometimes had unschooling articles and then it had Sandra&#39;s column.   I looked forward to those.   <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPreviously, Helen has made claims that she wants to try and unify the home educating population.    Obviously,  she doesn&#39;t want to include unschooling (or our definition of unschooling) in that population.   To me,  she has just divided the home educating community even more.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe more and more I thought about it,  and after discussing it with Sandra too,  I&#39;m fine in missing the magazine.   Like I said there wasn&#39;t much there for me anyway.  But now the masses are missing out on it too.   That&#39;s one big thing that made me sad.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHello Anna,<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the reply I sent in response to another person&#39;s letter this morning:<br/>\n<br/>\nHello &lt;name withheld&gt;,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for taking the time to write and share your concerns with me. <br/>\nA number of people have written about the same concerns, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen very busy with family matters these last few weeks and have not <br/>\nhad a chance to respond to anyone until now. If you have the <br/>\nopportunity - via discussion lists, message boards or other forums - <br/>\nperhaps you could share my reply here with others who are concerned <br/>\nabout the changes we&#39;ve made at HEM regarding Sandra Dodd. It&#39;s not <br/>\nnecessary, of course, and I&#39;ll be trying to find those who wrote <br/>\nearlier and reply to them directly, but their contact information may <br/>\nbe lost to me by now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I share your disappointment about Sandra&#39;s column no longer <br/>\nappearing in Home Education Magazine. I&#39;ve always loved the wonderful <br/>\nway Sandra could put words together to convey a thought or an idea or <br/>\na concept - that&#39;s why she was selected to be an HEM columnist in the <br/>\nfirst place. Her writing has a special quality, a clarity of purpose <br/>\nand a way of making the reader feel as though they, too, can do all <br/>\nthe wonderful things she writes about doing, whether it&#39;s making math <br/>\nsimple and easy to understand or sharing music with her kids and <br/>\nfriends and family or just enjoying the simple wonderfulness of <br/>\nwatching her children figure things out for themselves. She could <br/>\nwrite it all down in a way that made you feel like you could do all <br/>\nof that and more with your own kids. Her writing is clean, pure, and <br/>\nhonest, and those qualities do not come through in everyone&#39;s writing <br/>\nlike they come through in hers. If it was ONLY about the writing, I&#39;m <br/>\ncertain that Sandra would still be writing for HEM, but her writing <br/>\nwas only a small part of a much larger situation which led to our <br/>\nmaking the decisions we made.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand it there has always been plenty of Sandra&#39;s writing <br/>\navailable online, not only at her own website but at many other <br/>\nsites, forums, discussion lists, and in books and magazines. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink her absence in HEM will be much noticed by those who want to <br/>\nread her writing, as I believe she wrote far more for other venues <br/>\nthan she ever wrote for our bimonthly magazine. She&#39;s a very prolific <br/>\nwriter and a tireless advocate on the lists and forums. In that <br/>\nrespect, HEM was never much of a source for those who wanted to <br/>\nbenefit from her writing and discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, it has struck those of us here at HEM as odd that <br/>\npeople think there has been some significant change in the magazine. <br/>\nAlmost everyone associated with HEM - the publishers, editors, <br/>\nwriters, columnists, office staff and various others - are all <br/>\nunschoolers at heart, all believe pretty much the same kinds of <br/>\nthings Sandra has written about and promoted, and have always worked <br/>\nhard to share the unschooling philosophy with our readers. The odd <br/>\nattitude that Sandra&#39;s column was the only thing worth reading in HEM <br/>\nand it&#39;s not worth subscribing if she&#39;s not going to be writing for <br/>\nit is a somewhat bizarre revelation to us - and it tells us all that <br/>\nthis is much more about Sandra&#39;s faithful followers defending some <br/>\nperceived wrongdoing than about anything truly relating to our <br/>\nmagazine. That also strikes us as bizarre because we&#39;ve always <br/>\nthought true unschooling was about finding one&#39;s own path and not <br/>\nsimply dogging someone else&#39;s footsteps to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always loved what John Holt had to say about that concept: That <br/>\ntrue leaders don&#39;t look around to see who&#39;s following them, they <br/>\nsimply move ahead doing what they think is right and good and in <br/>\ndoing so they empower others to do the same for themselves.

I can&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve someone who has published a magazine of this long standing could be<br/>\nwriting unintentionally or be oblivious to the insulting tone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I have never subscribed to HEM, because from the odd copy I have<br/>\nperused it did look like it was trying to cast too broad a net of general<br/>\nHome Schooling, and I was interested in Radical Unschooling. Actually the<br/>\npoint they make that Sandra has a lot published on the web is true. However<br/>\nnot everyone who reads HEM is necessarily on line a lot, and now new<br/>\nsubscribers won&#39;t even hear her name in that publication or about her<br/>\nwebsite. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth to feel like they resent her<br/>\npopularity on line. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is clearly more to be revealed in the message boards situation too.<br/>\nHmmmm. :/<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing that Anna.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I had sent an email<br/>\nstating my concern about the removal of Sandra&#39;s column, not so much<br/>\nspecific to Sandra but to the loss of what I saw as the only &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>\npiece in the magazine.   In the response, she asks that it be posted to<br/>\nshare the &#39;information&#39;.   I have some pretty strong feelings about what<br/>\nshe has written here but will let everyone else form their own opinions :) <br/>\nSorry if this is a repeat for anyone.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHello Anna,<br/>\n <br/>\nHere&#39;s the reply I sent in response to another person&#39;s letter this morning:<br/>\n <br/>\nHello &lt;name withheld&gt;,<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks for taking the time to write and share your concerns with me. <br/>\nA number of people have written about the same concerns, but I&#39;ve <br/>\nbeen very busy with family matters these last few weeks and have not <br/>\nhad a chance to respond to anyone until now. If you have the <br/>\nopportunity - via discussion lists, message boards or other forums - <br/>\nperhaps you could share my reply here with others who are concerned <br/>\nabout the changes we&#39;ve made at HEM regarding Sandra Dodd. It&#39;s not <br/>\nnecessary, of course, and I&#39;ll be trying to find those who wrote <br/>\nearlier and reply to them directly, but their contact information may <br/>\nbe lost to me by now.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I share your disappointment about Sandra&#39;s column no longer <br/>\nappearing in Home Education Magazine. I&#39;ve always loved the wonderful <br/>\nway Sandra could put words together to convey a thought or an idea or <br/>\na concept - that&#39;s why she was selected to be an HEM columnist in the <br/>\nfirst place. Her writing has a special quality, a clarity of purpose <br/>\nand a way of making the reader feel as though they, too, can do all <br/>\nthe wonderful things she writes about doing, whether it&#39;s making math <br/>\nsimple and easy to understand or sharing music with her kids and <br/>\nfriends and family or just enjoying the simple wonderfulness of <br/>\nwatching her children figure things out for themselves. She could <br/>\nwrite it all down in a way that made you feel like you could do all <br/>\nof that and more with your own kids. Her writing is clean, pure, and <br/>\nhonest, and those qualities do not come through in everyone&#39;s writing <br/>\nlike they come through in hers. If it was ONLY about the writing, I&#39;m <br/>\ncertain that Sandra would still be writing for HEM, but her writing <br/>\nwas only a small part of a much larger situation which led to our <br/>\nmaking the decisions we made.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs I understand it there has always been plenty of Sandra&#39;s writing <br/>\navailable online, not only at her own website but at many other <br/>\nsites, forums, discussion lists, and in books and magazines. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink her absence in HEM will be much noticed by those who want to <br/>\nread her writing, as I believe she wrote far more for other venues <br/>\nthan she ever wrote for our bimonthly magazine. She&#39;s a very prolific <br/>\nwriter and a tireless advocate on the lists and forums. In that <br/>\nrespect, HEM was never much of a source for those who wanted to <br/>\nbenefit from her writing and discussions.<br/>\n <br/>\nAt the same time, it has struck those of us here at HEM as odd that <br/>\npeople think there has been some significant change in the magazine. <br/>\nAlmost everyone associated with HEM - the publishers, editors, <br/>\nwriters, columnists, office staff and various others - are all <br/>\nunschoolers at heart, all believe pretty much the same kinds of <br/>\nthings Sandra has written about and promoted, and have always worked <br/>\nhard to share the unschooling philosophy with our readers. The odd <br/>\nattitude that Sandra&#39;s column was the only thing worth reading in HEM <br/>\nand it&#39;s not worth subscribing if she&#39;s not going to be writing for <br/>\nit is a somewhat bizarre revelation to us - and it tells us all that <br/>\nthis is much more about Sandra&#39;s faithful followers defending some <br/>\nperceived wrongdoing than about anything truly relating to our <br/>\nmagazine. That also strikes us as bizarre because we&#39;ve always <br/>\nthought true unschooling was about finding one&#39;s own path and not <br/>\nsimply dogging someone else&#39;s footsteps to learn.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve always loved what John Holt had to say about that concept: That <br/>\ntrue leaders don&#39;t look around to see who&#39;s following them, they <br/>\nsimply move ahead doing what they think is right and good and in <br/>\ndoing so they empower others to do the same for themselves. That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat we&#39;ve been doing at HEM for over 20 years, and it&#39;s what we&#39;ll <br/>\ncontinue to do for the next 20.<br/>\n <br/>\nThanks again for writing,<br/>\nHelen<br/>\n~~~~<br/>\nHelen Hegener, publisher<br/>\nHome Education Magazine<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeedmag.com\">http://www.homeedmag.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20765,"nextTopicId":20758}}
