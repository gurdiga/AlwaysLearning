I think we also know there is reason to believe that the new administration will be more willing to listen to educators&#39; suggestions for public school reform in which at-risk learners will be paid more attention. Hooray for that!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf a move to leave no children behind pushes more students out of school, it is fairly obvious that NCLB was a mistake. A 7-year mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNAREN has mailed a letter to President-elect Obama urging the formation of a grassroots Educational Reform Council to work during the interim to overhaul how we are/are not educating at-risk youth towards success, which is our business.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will take us a long time to crawl out of this hole we are in - on all fronts: war, economy, unemployment, fuel issues, and most important to us, the 30% of students who we have failed to reach (if failure-to-complete figures signify that to you).  In this new atmosphere of hope we, of all people, must unite more than ever in our quest for effectiveness in education. In the name of compassion for youth and passi<br/>\non for our cause, we must renew our vows to learn from our mistakes quickly and see through the glass clearly how we can reach the unreachable, encourage the discouraged, and insist upon quality in the teaching of the disqualified.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a new dawn. It will deliver us nothing of its own accord, but will listen to our initiatives, our insistence, and our efforts to MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN to reduce that 30%.*<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI urge you to pay attention to opportunities that come your way, and if they do not, Make some!
