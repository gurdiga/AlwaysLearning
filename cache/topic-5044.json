Dh and I would try to demonstrate or show<br/>\nhim &quot;the right way&quot;, ie. how to hold a baseball bat. <br/>\nWhenever we did this, he would just drop his head &<br/>\nhis bat & not want to play anymore.  Duh!  What helped<br/>\nthe most was for us to stop telling him how to do it. <br/>\nWe also verbalize what we are doing, especially when<br/>\nmaking mistakes, so he could see us not performing<br/>\n&quot;perfectly&quot; every time. (modeling imperfection)  Over<br/>\ntime he was able to &quot;miss&quot; hitting the ball & instead<br/>\nof &quot;quitting&quot;, he&#39;d just say &quot;oops, missed it, I&#39;ll<br/>\ntry again&quot;.  When I miss the ball, he says &quot;good try<br/>\nmom.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nheather in tucson<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
