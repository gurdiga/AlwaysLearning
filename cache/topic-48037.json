I have heard that they can help with issues like this. Or another alternative health practitioner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my husband had a health issue that the doctors could not help him with, we sent out an email to all the alternative health practitioners in our city that we could find and described the health issue and the symptoms. We then asked if they had any experience dealing with this type of thing and asked them what their course of treatment would be. Many responded and there were several good options, but we picked the one we thought to be most promising. The treatment had a positive effect for our entire family - because it radically improved my husband&#39;s health and his mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to suggest something about introducing more vegetables to our diet that has worked well for my children (aged 4 and 3). We often tell their favourite stories during dinner time and pretend the vegetables are from the story. We become the characters (ie. Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton Tail, and Peter Rabbit) and we slowly work our way eating Mr. McGregor&#39;s garden. The other thing we do is pretend to be professional chefs hosting our own t.v. show and we talk about each vegetable and describe it with great love and passion as we chop it all up and then we call our creation &quot;scrumptious ...&quot; (ie. scrumptious soup).

With the medical side taken care of, where to go forward from here? whether or not you take up therapy, this is also about living day-to-day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had similar situation with my youngest.  We stopped talking about it as a problem, and kindly said that this was just another thing that his body was learning, like jumping and sleeping and burping. We got lots and lots of undies for him and basically started to use them as &#39;if-necessary-disposables&#39;.Accident in the pants/ couldn&#39;t get to the bathroom fast enough? let&#39;s have a look, can we clean the undies easily? no, then I&#39;ll throw them out. not to worry, we&#39;ll try again next time. We also changed our daily routine to give him plenty of time to go to the toilet (couldn&#39;t have done this with school), if we were planning to go somewhere that had no set start time, we just delayed our departure until he had had enough to finish his poo. This often took, ten or more trips to the bathroom.<br/>\nI put a full change of clothes (summer and winter) in the back of the car. just in case. it&#39;s now been about four months since we&#39;ve needed it, but I&#39;m sure will still come in handy for weather changes and water play at the park.<br/>\nAlso discovered that he hated going to public toilets for poo, when we were there dirty undies and miserable mum, I was saying how much I hated being in the shopping centre bathrooms, he agreed! (hence so many accidents out and about), so we agreed that I&#39;d tell him plenty of time beforehand if we were heading to the shops, or we could go home if he told me earlyish. This has worked a treat, and he is now going well without a bathroom in public, but will be first in line at home.<br/>\nKnowing that nothing fun was going to happen without him (we stopped board games / cards / reading etc) and reassuring him that he didn&#39;t need to rush, he is now very rarely having accidents. He&#39;ll also tell us now if he doesn&#39;t need us to wait with a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess most of all, we all started reminding each other that it&#39;d be OK.<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers Trude</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123650904,"authorName":"aljonesz","from":"&quot;aljonesz&quot; &lt;a.l.jonesz@...&gt;","profile":"aljonesz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Chronic constipation-sorry so long","postDate":"1256042261","msgId":48051,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhia2F1bCtzN2R0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDI3NTkwNi4zNTQ1OS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48043,"nextInTopic":48053,"prevInTime":48050,"nextInTime":48052,"topicId":48037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think in my original post I wasn t clear about all the components that I think went into this problem.

In the year prior to and during the start of the problem we had moved house 2 times, I was depressed for a few months, then I was very ill with pregnancy so much so that that is why she was in daycare because I was too ill to look after her.  In daycare we found out another boy was hitting her.  My husband and I were on the verge of divorce.  Then she had a new baby sister who was nursing and she wasn&#39;t.  She felt like i sent her to playgroup to be with the baby alone.  And I was completely at a loss for how to deal with her because all I knew was conventional parenting methods.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in past year and half, marriage has sorted itself out.  I found out about attachment parenting and unschooling.  We cosleep.  I try every day to make sure she feels like she has a choice in her life.  I think on a lot of levels she still feels very powerless.  Of course I sometimes fall into bad habits and coerce her into things or lose my temper and yell.  That is getting better all the time.

But then that shouldn&#39;t even be a fear since if you are operating to your own satisfaction now in the shape you are in, then even if they do find something wrong and incurable, you can still continue to be happy being yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I imagine you are afraid they are going to rule you an unfit parent due to unschooling. Again, why not see this as an opportunity to show the world there is nothing wrong with unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line, I feel your concern should be with them helping you diagnose and curing what ever needs to be cured instead of being concerned that they might take something away from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my $0.02 worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad Jones</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":123650904,"authorName":"aljonesz","from":"&quot;aljonesz&quot; &lt;a.l.jonesz@...&gt;","profile":"aljonesz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Chronic constipation-sorry so long","postDate":"1255958394","msgId":48037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhiaHAxcStpcWVmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48038,"prevInTime":48036,"nextInTime":48038,"topicId":48037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a situation with my older girl(age 5) where she has a medical problem  (chronic constipation since age 3).

We have been working with a consultant through the Natuinal Health Service (NHS) to treat the problem medically however it probably has some emotional component.  We have been offered to see a child therapist but I am very reluctant because I not sure they will understand radical unschooling and will look askance at some of our choices.  Including that I still breastfeed her younger sister(age 2).  And with all the worry about the Badman report (a recent review of home education in the UK) I am very reluctant to trust what is essentially the government (the NHS supplied therapist) with sensitive information about my children and my family.  I am happy to carry on as we are waiting until my daughter is ready to use a potty and pooh without medication but my husband feels I am being very paranoid and overlooking what could be very helpful.  I have summed the situation up as follows for any thoughts on the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen DD1 was 2.5 years she was in daycare 2 days a week and DD2 had just been born.  I was just finding attachment parenting and not even heard of unschooling yet. DD1 started asking about wearing panties and using the potty, in retrospect it may have been pressure from daycare.  We started using panties.  She wasn&#39;t very successful she had lots of accidents with urination but rarely with pooh.  I took her out of daycare a month into this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 6 months, she started at a playgroup 3 mornings (sort of a preschool)  She started poohing her pants.  We didn&#39;t know that the people at the playgroup would rush her and not let her have enough time to pooh.  Prior to this, she was quite regular in the mornings.  At this point (although we didn&#39;t know it) she started being constipated and then soiling (leakage around a constipation).   She had never had a constipation problem before.  She is a very picky eater and has always eaten lots of fruit (not so much veg).  To deal with problem of accidents we put her back in diapers and took her out of playgroup.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver next 6 months things got much worse.  She started sqatting and holding her pooh in.  Sometimes she would go thru periods of squatting every 10 minutes for hours.  It was interfering with her activities, she was soiling 6-8 times a day, she would go over a week without a proper pooh. She was lethargic.  She would get diaper rash and still not want her nappy changed. <br/>\n<br/>\nI researched online and realized that we were dealing with a chronic constipation issue.   She had probably developed constipation, had some painful pooh and then started holding it in a spiral that worsened over time and resulted in an enlarged colon and damage to nerves that controlled defecation.  I got her into see a specialist doctor who put her on medicine to completely empty her colon so it could recover normal function. It seems in chronic constipation, when you get a stretched colon you need someway to get it back to normal and I didn&#39;t see any other way to accomplish that other than with medication. She is such a picky eater trying to add in more fiber was no help and she already had a diet high in fruit.<br/>\n<br/>\n She has been on medication for 10 months now (she is 5 years old).  The dose has been slowly lowered over time and I would love to have her off of it but am so scared of going back to how it was at the worst time.  I think there is an emotional component to all of this whether it was the new baby, the playgroup, feeling powerless, something but neither my husband or I have ever been able to get her to speak to us about it.  We are considering taking her to a therapist but this seems like such a big step and I feel were are very vulnerable as we attachment parent and unschool.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47845,"nextTopicId":48064}}
