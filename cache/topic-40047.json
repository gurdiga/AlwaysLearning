When the priorities are known (at our house, happiness<br/>\nand learning) then when there&#39;s a conflict, the thing that leads more<br/>\ntoward learning or fulfilling obligations (kids being at work on<br/>\ntime, getting purchases to the post office) or things that lead to<br/>\nmore peace will get the first car keys and money. Other things can<br/>\nwait.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids were babies, we tried to make them comfortable. In no<br/>\ntime at all, we started seeing them trying to make other people<br/>\ncomfortable, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy further answer:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I do lots of things for each other.  We did before we  <br/>\nhad children.  It wasn&#39;t always &quot;compromise&quot;--there were more  <br/>\ncreative solutions many times.  For example, if we were at a party  <br/>\nand he was ready to go home and I wasn&#39;t (I&#39;m an extrovert and he&#39;s  <br/>\nnot), sometimes he would get a ride home, or he would take the car  <br/>\nand I would get a ride  home later.  That&#39;s a win/win, not a  <br/>\ncompromise.  Sometimes if other rides weren&#39;t going to work, he would  <br/>\nstay a little later than he wanted to, and I would leave earlier than  <br/>\nI would have liked.  That&#39;s a compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have not &quot;taught&quot; our children to &quot;truly compromise.&quot;  Yet my  <br/>\nchildren are very considerate of other people in situations in which  <br/>\ndifferent desires are expressed (Holly not so much when it involves  <br/>\nwhich restaurant to go to, but she&#39;s gotten better over the years).   <br/>\nThey have lots of experience in finding solutions to disagreements  <br/>\nand disparate wishes.  Because we&#39;ve been nice to them, they&#39;re full  <br/>\nof niceness for others.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad our goal been to teach them to truly compromise, they wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>\nnearly as cool and easy to get along with as they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":40046,"nextTopicId":40050}}
