It&#39;s an easy catch-all term with not much thought behind it.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; People talk as if being &quot;outside&quot; doing absolutely anything is better<br/>\n&gt; &gt; than having &quot;screen time.&quot; Really? That&#39;s just so obviously lame.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If I insisted that Senna &quot;get outside&quot; instead of being at her<br/>\n&gt; computer right now, I&#39;d be stopping her from doing something really<br/>\n&gt; nice for her Pokemon friends. Some of them are having birthdays around<br/>\n&gt; this time, so she&#39;s drawing pictures of their favorite Pokemon as<br/>\n&gt; gifts. She&#39;s also planning out a &quot;group photo&quot; of the Pokemon<br/>\n&gt; roleplayers&#39;s characters to celebrate the first anniversary of the<br/>\n&gt; (online) roleplay&#39;s beginning. She&#39;s arranging them by color dots at<br/>\n&gt; the moment, to balance out the similar colors in the picture before<br/>\n&gt; she goes ahead to actually sketch out each character.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I would be interrupting her creative process by nudging her to go out.<br/>\n&gt; I would be interrupting her from forging some important connections<br/>\n&gt; with those players, as she thinks about each one of them and their<br/>\n&gt; stories for their characters.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But one of the worst things that could happen is she&#39;d resent me and<br/>\n&gt; my agenda for her. That wouldn&#39;t help our relationship, at all.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Robin B.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62109,"nextTopicId":62135}}
