We had some Mag Heads, different shapes that could put together to make abstract looking characters, and he liked incorporating the words from magnetic poetry into his creations.  Making hats or clothing our of words like &quot;bird&quot; or &quot;tent&quot; or having words like &quot;tired&quot; or &quot;out&quot; in the place of eyes.   He got to recognize many words but was also happy to play with the magnetic words without always knowing what the word was.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThose magnets sometimes got used in train or other play.  Dylan would set up his Thomas trains and if he thought a place needed trees but didn&#39;t have any more little wooden trees to put there, he would get the magnet that said &quot;tree&quot; and the space where he put it became the forest.  The  word &quot;rock&quot; was an obstruction on the tracks, or a rock slide, or a boulder a monster might hide behind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all played with those.  David, who in those days would be gone to work before Dylan woke up, would leave messages for Dylan on the refrigerator.   &quot;Cow will eat your shoe&quot; or &quot;frog dance on jelly&quot;  and Dylan would be so excited to go see what his dad had left him and maybe make some little message for his dad to find that night when he got home.  We still have refrigerator poetry and still leave messages for each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor Dylan reading came gradually over years and whole word recognition was the biggest part of how he learned.   He read books beyond his reading ability quite happily by simply skipping the words he did not recognize.    Occasionally he asked what a word was, but only if it was an interesting looking word, or if it was repeated often enough for him to wonder whether it held some significance to the story.      <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"lylaw","from":"&quot;lylaw&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Supporting a child in learning to read.","postDate":"1300744341","msgId":60352,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1MzFCOUNGRTkyRTQyMTE5RTZFQTg0RTgyQkVENTk0QEx5bGFQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NTY3MDhCLTVGMDktNENBNi04NEM0LTQwQjM0MzkyNTUyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGltM3Q5ais1MTQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDY3NjY5LjMyNzU4LnFtQHdlYjg2MjA0Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPDY4NTY3MDhCLTVGMDktNENBNi04NEM0LTQwQjM0MzkyNTUyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60351,"nextInTopic":60353,"prevInTime":60351,"nextInTime":60353,"topicId":60285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"this study is interesting and speaks to the advantages of children exploring and learning things on their own, vs. being “taught”: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1047060275\">this study is interesting and speaks to the advantages of children exploring and learning things on their own, vs. being “taught”:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16gopnik.html?_r=1\">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16gopnik.html?_r=1</a><br/>\nthis other, older article by alfie kohn gets at the same concepts, slightly different way –<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/edweek/rotten.htm\">http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/edweek/rotten.htm</a><br/>\nneither are unschooling articles but they do speak to the underlying principles of learning and intrinsic motivation that are so important with unschooling.<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Supporting a child in learning to read.","postDate":"1300739394","msgId":60349,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc3ODcwNS43MzY0Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDREODdBRDI5LjUwNDA5QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PGltN3QwMStuMnFzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTMxNkY5QzYtRUEzNi00RjhGLUExNDQtMUYyRjgwMTQ4NTkyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NEQ4N0FEMjkuNTA0MDlAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":60348,"nextInTopic":60351,"prevInTime":60348,"nextInTime":60350,"topicId":60285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***It was super obvious when Rosie was from about 4 to 8 years old that her brain was not able to put together sounds and symbols - she seemed unable to really","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-422628145\">***It was super <br/>\nobvious when Rosie was from about 4 to 8 years old that her brain was <br/>\nnot able to put together sounds and symbols - she seemed unable to <br/>\nreally &quot;hear&quot; the distinct sounds in a word until she was much older - <br/>\ncloser to 13 years old.***<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yes, Chamille didn&#39;t get phonics at all until AFTER she already knew how to <br/>\nread.

My DS is older than yours and we have a different history. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt this stage I would just be open in your own mind to the fact that there are many many ways he might come to reading. You don&#39;t need to show him what they are or might be. It can be exciting when you think your child is starting to read and with all your unschooling enthusiasm you want to support it but often our thoughts about how to support it fall back to schooly techniques and resources. Actually supporting him is just having fun and providing rich experiences for him they don&#39;t have to be tailored to reading at all. and as he is showing frustration they probably should be distracting from the written word and doing other things instead.<br/>\nJo</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Supporting a child in learning to read.","postDate":"1300738728","msgId":60348,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzAxNi45MDA3MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGltODJ0dStpbmhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGltODJ0dStpbmhzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60347,"nextInTopic":60349,"prevInTime":60347,"nextInTime":60349,"topicId":60285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Magnetic letters are fun for this, too - spell out some gibberish and pronounce it.

She was a word collector.  She&#39;d remember words, how to spell them, how to <br/>\nsay them, in short, she&#39;d recognize them.  At that point I went around putting <br/>\nstickers on things all over the house with the word written on it.  I had the <br/>\nwhole bathroom stickered for a long time.  There was a sticker that said <br/>\n&quot;mirror&quot;, or &quot;toothpaste&quot;, or &quot;toilet&quot;, etc.  Those stickers were up for over a <br/>\nyear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were several other huge contributing factors to Chamille learning to read. <br/>\n One was video games, specifically ToonTown, and the other was books on tape and <br/>\ncd.  Book for book, she&#39;d absorbed more than her peers, her cousins included, <br/>\nwho were competitive school readers but didn&#39;t own any books at home.  She <br/>\nwatched movies that were based on books.  She did book and movie comparisons.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, by the time she could read a whole book, which was a manga, at the age of <br/>\n11, she&#39;d already had years of language and word usage and word recognition. <br/>\n She understands grammar, she spells almost perfectly, and she knows the <br/>\ndifference between &quot;their&quot;, &quot;they&#39;re&quot;, and &quot;there&quot;.  School friends go to her to <br/>\nmake sure that they have it right.  I didn&#39;t teach her any of that.  She <br/>\nabsorbed it from living a life full of good fiction!<br/>\n<br/>\nHer younger sister, who is 9, can read almost everything.  For the last couple <br/>\nof years she has relied almost entirely on phonics.  She sounds words out.  It <br/>\nis just what she does.  I correct her when she gets it wrong and I&#39;m patient <br/>\nwhile reading with her to give her a chance to figure it out first.  It&#39;s a slow <br/>\nand sometimes tedious process.  When she gets a word wrong and I say it right, <br/>\nher response is generally one of interest and amusement at how it&#39;s spelled so <br/>\ndifferent from how it&#39;s spoken.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux has never been all that interested in story books.  She likes picture <br/>\nbooks.  She still reads her picture books, especially the ones with any touch <br/>\nand feel, or look and find.  She LOVES &quot;I Spy&quot; books!  She likes to go online <br/>\nand look up youtube videos and play Facebook games or chat there.  These days, I <br/>\nrarely need to spell out a word for her.  She doesn&#39;t always spell it right, but <br/>\nshe&#39;ll spell how it sounds and others can still read and understand what she&#39;s <br/>\nwritten.  Sometimes I correct her and sometimes I don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust like all kinds of learning, there is a point at which a kid will be on the <br/>\ncusp of figuring something out, where there is frustration before understanding. <br/>\n Reading is no different than say, learning how to use scissors.  There will <br/>\nlikely be frustration and mistakes, but if it&#39;s fun, they&#39;ll still figure it <br/>\nout!<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Supporting a child in learning to read.","postDate":"1300737580","msgId":60345,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDREODdBRTJDLjkwMzA2MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGltODczZCt0bWI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGltODczZCt0bWI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60343,"nextInTopic":60347,"prevInTime":60344,"nextInTime":60346,"topicId":60285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Do you, maybe, <br/>\nequate learning to read with &quot;sounding it out?&quot; That&#39;s a very limited <br/>\nidea of what reading is, but it would explain why you think there are <br/>\nall these rules he&#39;ll need to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a feeling that you don&#39;t really grasp how much more there is to <br/>\nlearning to read than learning all the &quot;sounding out&quot; rules. I have <br/>\nthree kids who each learned to read in their own natural way and those <br/>\nways were each very very different from the others. The most <br/>\ninteresting, to me, was watching Rosie (now 20) learn to read. She did <br/>\nnot even know the sounds of all the letters of the alphabet when she was <br/>\nalready reading quite a bit. She had learned to recognize words - not to <br/>\nsound them out. She learned to recognize a LOT of words - hundreds - <br/>\nbefore she started to use the sounds to figure words out. It was super <br/>\nobvious when Rosie was from about 4 to 8 years old that her brain was <br/>\nnot able to put together sounds and symbols - she seemed unable to <br/>\nreally &quot;hear&quot; the distinct sounds in a word until she was much older - <br/>\ncloser to 13 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a kid is interested in &quot;sounding out,&quot; they will be very specific in <br/>\ntheir questions or comments. I remember Roxana asking about the sounds <br/>\nthe letter &quot;O&quot; makes - and thinking it was interesting that it didn&#39;t <br/>\nalways make an &quot;O&quot; sound (as in &quot;oh&quot;). And at that time she sort of <br/>\ncollected words with &quot;O&quot; in them and was trying to find all the possible <br/>\nsounds that an &quot;O&quot; could make. Roxana is STILL very interested in sounds <br/>\n- at 23 years old she still finds language fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - part of the problem I have with giving reading instructions <br/>\n(teaching the child the rules of sounding out, for example) is that it <br/>\npresupposes a certain way of learning - that a kid should learn to <br/>\n&quot;sound out&quot; words in order to learn to read. What if that isn&#39;t the <br/>\nnatural way that kid&#39;s brain works? It could have unintended negative <br/>\nconsequences. AND it isn&#39;t necessary. Have fun - if a kid is asking <br/>\nquestions, answer them with brief tidbits of helpful information and be <br/>\nsensitive - don&#39;t overload. If a kid is indicating an interest in the <br/>\nsounds that make up a word, then have some fun with that. But if a kid <br/>\nis wanting to read, don&#39;t assume he is interested in how to &quot;sound out&quot; <br/>\nwords. Maybe he wishes he didn&#39;t need to depend on mom to read for him, <br/>\nbut that isn&#39;t the same thing as being ready and able to sound out <br/>\nwords. Maybe he&#39;s a kid who won&#39;t learn to sound out words for years <br/>\nmore - maybe he&#39;ll learn to recognize a LOT of words, first.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a rich environment where you introduce a variety of <br/>\nactivities and games and discussions and so on, and if you stick with <br/>\nthe policy of only continuing doing things that are enjoyable, and if <br/>\nyou&#39;re sensitive to whether or not the child really IS enjoying whatever <br/>\nyou&#39;re doing, then I think you&#39;re safe from creating problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that many learning disabilities (so-called) are caused by <br/>\nearly instruction that is not in line with a child&#39;s own learning style. <br/>\nPushing in the wrong direction can, imo, be harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Colleen","from":"&quot;Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Supporting a child in learning to read.","postDate":"1300733869","msgId":60341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGltODczZCt0bWI1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDY4NTY3MDhCLTVGMDktNENBNi04NEM0LTQwQjM0MzkyNTUyMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60339,"nextInTopic":60343,"prevInTime":60340,"nextInTime":60342,"topicId":60285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*****For instance, some people, if asked why there s a silent w in two will say something like because English is stupid, or I don t know. ***** My 8","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1595131621\">*****For instance, some people, if asked why there&#39;s a silent &quot;w&quot; in &quot;two&quot; will say something like &quot;because English is stupid,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;*****<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 8 year old reads, but is only just beginning to show an interest in spelling.

However I completely agree with not using it in anyway as a teaching point and to consider that his needing to ask the questions may be coming from a different place than readiness and natural inclination. Also as suggested to move the focus way way away from the written word as much as possible and have more fun,fun,fun. As well as more deschooling around reading and learning in general.<br/>\nMy other point was just using my DS as an example to try to put across to the OP the possibility that just because a child is trying hard to use a certain method or do a certain thing does not always mean he is naturally drawn to it or ready for it. It may be because he believes he should be able to do it/ is scared that he won&#39;t be able to do it/ likes how much a parent likes him doing it or thinks that is the only way to do it. So not necessarily a natural inclination for phonics. <br/>\nWith my DS, given his personality, age and my knowledge of him, a short casual conversation at an opportune moment was fine. There were probably other ways I could have approached it but that seemed like best fit with my knowledge of both of us.

So it seems like his question is not what is this word but something different. I may have misunderstood this though. However if he is asking a question about the letters/ phonics/ rules and not asking outright what the word is ,is it then helpful to just answer with what the word is?<br/>\nIf my son asked me what 8 and 8 more was I would tell him the answer. however if he saw the following written down 8 + 8 and asked me what the + meant I would not just tell him the answer is 16 as that wasn&#39;t his question. I would also apply this to reading as well. Am I missing something? <br/>\n<br/>\nI also wonder if there is some perception by the child that this is *THE* way to read and that may be why he is not looking at or grasping whole words and feeling frustrated at not being able to decode everything. My son has not been taught to read but has been exposed to some phonics mainly due to kids TV that my younger DD loves. It became clear to me after a while that he believed he couldn&#39;t read because he couldn&#39;t decode every word and discounted words that he knew through recognition. <br/>\nI had a brief and very casual conversation with him about different ways people come to reading and he seemed to relax a lot around it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself I think I learnt to read the whole word way and built up a large lexicon that then enabled me to recognise patterns and decode other words that way but I do not believe I did it through phonics even then - but a more visual pattern recognition.<br/>\nI remember once having an aha moment on watching Sesame Street showing how the letter e changed the length of the vowel in a word ie. cod or code. However I already &quot;knew&quot; that rule I just had never had a verbal expression for it it was just a pattern I recognised at some level. It never held me back I was a voracious reader from an early age.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think my son struggled for a short while with the received idea that he needed to use phonics to decode words or he wasn&#39;t reading. That was because he had no information that there are other ways of reading and they are not cheating but valid.<br/>\nHe will be 8 tomorrow and would not choose to read a book but his vocabulary of recognisable words is visibly expanding. As he doesn&#39;t have to demonstrate any of this to me I can only assume it is probably greater than I know about. He seems happy and continues to gain much pleasure and knowledge from books via me or DH reading to him and the same with computer/DS games. <br/>\nHe loves language and words and plays with them all the time making up wordplays and jokes based on wordplay. His spoken and understood vocabulary is pretty amazing to me. His viewpoint is that the most efficient way at the moment for him to get enjoyment or information from the written word is by us reading it to him. However he is also moving more and more towards reading things for himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway my main point was that frustration may come from believing that decoding is the only way to read even if it doesn&#39;t come easily. That may not be the case for this child but, as there seems to be a great deal of emphasis on phonics on kids TV (at least in the UK),it may be the case for others.<br/>\nJo</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":331885657,"authorName":"Jennifer Schuelein","from":"&quot;Jennifer Schuelein&quot; &lt;fairiedust66@...&gt;","profile":"jenfromtx6","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Supporting a child in learning to read.","postDate":"1300686278","msgId":60318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGltNm9rNitkZzgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGltM3Q5ais1MTQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60314,"nextInTopic":60322,"prevInTime":60317,"nextInTime":60319,"topicId":60285,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When Xander was 7 and 8 we worked on sight words.

He was also trying to learn how to write and this was even more frustrating. No matter how much he wanted to learn, he just was not able to read or write to his satisfaction or at the level he wanted. (Xan wasn&#39;t interested in reading beginning books. He wanted novels right away.) I realized that Xan was just not ready to read or write at that time. We stopped doing anything formal right away. Xan started reading for himself at age 10 and is very proficient! I gave him some basics, but he took it from there. I am so glad I didn&#39;t make him use the phonics tiles my mother bought for us. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Xan asked me to read a sign or what not (before he could read), I would just read it and make sure to pronounce it clearly. He would usually repeat it (on his own accord) and then we&#39;d continue on with what we were doing. I kept it simple. I have a bad habit of always reading signs out loud to this day, even without being asked.

Sounding out words were <br/>\nnot the way for him.<br/>\nIt would have made him quite confuse had I tried to &quot;help&quot; him by sounding out <br/>\nwords or letters.<br/>\n At six and a half he was reading fluently and a year later he started asking me <br/>\nthings like:<br/>\nWhy does &quot;inset word&quot; sounds like this? Shouldn&#39;t it sound like &quot; insert <br/>\nother pronunciation&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nIT was very  interesting. He still like to play with words and sounds!<br/>\n Had I  tried to &quot;teach&quot; him I would have made him very confuse. He can get <br/>\nfrustrated easy.<br/>\nSo Starfall was boring to him. He was into Roblox back then ( an online building <br/>\ngame).<br/>\nThat is how he learned to read. I sat with him hours reading and typing so he <br/>\nwould talk to other players.<br/>\nThen he could read some and pick out pre-written phrases out of a menu and write <br/>\nthings like: follow me,  <br/>\n<br/>\nwant to be my friend, cool, lets build.<br/>\n Then I would sit and help with reading and spell out the words so he could <br/>\ntype. In the beginning I had to point<br/>\nto the keyboard so he would know which letters. Then I did not need anymore. He <br/>\nneeded me less and less until<br/>\nhe rarely needed me and I would be in another room and just shout  back to him <br/>\nor write in a piece of paper  for him to copy.<br/>\n Then he picked up a book and read a story to his sister and my mouth fell. I <br/>\nknew he could read and write but<br/>\njust how well and fast.
