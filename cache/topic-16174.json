She downloaded some <br/>\nof his songs off the computer and knows all the words to most of them.<br/>\nHave you heard the Hardware Store song?  He lists at a very fast pace <br/>\nall the things you can find in a hardware store.  It&#39;s great.  She&#39;s <br/>\ntrying to master that one.  Very difficult.<br/>\nI love Omish Paradise.
