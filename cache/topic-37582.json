Then when the day comes, he may notice that you&#39;ve deeply <br/>\nthought about him, and that feels really good. Maybe that&#39;s the kind <br/>\nof help he&#39;s asking for. Relief from the responsibility of choosing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe after midnight meal situation (from the other post)has happened <br/>\nmany times in our house, and we&#39;ve finally figured out that I (or my <br/>\nhusband) will only give maybe 2 or 3 options of food that we know <br/>\nthey like and we are truly happy to make at that hour. If those are <br/>\nrejected, then the kids are free to get something for themselves. <br/>\nTrotting out the list of all things possible is too much, and only <br/>\nleads to frustration. I try to keep some easy, pre-made and/or no-<br/>\nprep stuff on hand because I know from experience that my kids will <br/>\njust go without if it&#39;s too much trouble for them to make something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes making choices seems more like a big burden that involves <br/>\nother people and their wants and needs, not just a simple &quot;what do <br/>\n*you* want?&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like the homeschooling teens coming to town was a really <br/>\nbig deal, and maybe the Skype friends might be more of a regular <br/>\nthing, so if you know that to be true, maybe don&#39;t present it as an <br/>\nequal choice. Know that he would probably choose to hang with the <br/>\nteens (if that&#39;s true) and help him make that happen. I might have <br/>\nhelped him call those friends and tell them the truth in a sweet and <br/>\nconsiderate way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it seems like wide open options like making pro/con lists <br/>\nare too much information to consider when you are stressed already, <br/>\nor random ones like tossing a coin are unsatisfying because the <br/>\nspecific concerns, like potentially dissapointing some friends, are <br/>\nnot being addressed and are only left to chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nCindi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

I was already in<br/>\nbed but her dad wasn&#39;t and he was willing to make her something, which<br/>\nwas very sweet because I wasn&#39;t.  My answer to those late night<br/>\nrequests are that she can go into the kitchen and get whatever she<br/>\nwants, but I&#39;m not up for making a meal at 1am after I&#39;ve already gone<br/>\nto bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe absolutely wouldn&#39;t tell her dad what she wanted to eat.  She kept<br/>\nasking what her choices where.  Her dad and I kept rattling off choices<br/>\nand she kept saying &quot;no, what else is there, I want to know ALL my<br/>\nchoices.&quot;.  She wanted a run down on every single food item in the<br/>\nhouse and what could be made from them.  Dad wasn&#39;t willing to make<br/>\nthat sort of from scratch thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was upset about all of it, got upset with us for not accomadating<br/>\nher needs which seemed really unreasonable at 1am in the morning.  So,<br/>\nit ended with me saying that clearly she wasn&#39;t all that hungry if<br/>\nNOTHING would satisfy that need that she felt for food.  Her dad<br/>\nbrought her a popcycle, which she ate it and then fell asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe seems to like impossible scenarios and making it so there is<br/>\nseemingly no solution.  It&#39;s frustrating for everyone, especially her.<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;ll learn better coping tools for general<br/>\ndissatisfaction which is what seems to spur it on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she usually says she&#39;s hungry and she doesn&#39;t know what she wants,<br/>\nI run down a list of possibles based on various food qualities,<br/>\nlike &quot;are you in the mood for sweet, salty, warm, cold, fruity, meaty,<br/>\nbready, etc..?&quot;  That usually works because she can get a sense of what<br/>\nshe is really craving without comitting to a particular food or<br/>\nprepared dish.  It is generally someting else bugging her when she<br/>\ncan&#39;t pin down that, like in the case of last nights hungry/unsatisfied<br/>\ndilema.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe likes buffets because she can try it all!
