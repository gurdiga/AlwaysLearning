I&#39;m partly on this list because I have worked out my definitions and explanations about unschooling by reading but mostly without the refinement of conversation with other unschoolers, and now I want that refinement. I have gotten confused because I see ways I&#39;ve typically explained or thought about what we do dismissed or not preferred in conversation on this list, which has led to my asking questions. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs much as I&#39;d like the whole world to know that they don&#39;t need to stress out so much and can enjoy life with their kids, because of reading this list, I&#39;m learning it&#39;s wiser sometimes to not explain unschooling to people and be much more generic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do use the term &quot;unschool.&quot; I&#39;m just more careful now who I use it with. I went too far talking badly about school around the time my son turned 5 or 6. I left such a bad impression about it that my son swore for years that he&#39;d never choose to take any classes (which was funny because he was choosing to take gymnastics, day camp, etc...at the time). It also caused problems with our friends who schooled. I had to back off on talking badly about school because we were becoming chained by a judgmental attitude. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn &quot;unhurt, unchained, undamaged&quot; the &quot;un&#39;s&quot; are all connected to things that are inherently bad. If &quot;unschooled&quot; is to be compared with those, then that means school is inherently bad. I agree that compulsory school is destructive. Learning, by choice, in a large group setting with an instructor is not inherently poisonous, however, especially if you&#39;re unschooled from the beginning and don&#39;t have baggage associated with words like &quot;school&quot; or &quot;teach.&quot; Maybe equating &quot;unschooled&quot; with &quot;unbleached&quot; is a better thought for me. Bleach can be dangerous and poisonous but can also be used, by choice, helpfully and creatively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for taking time to discuss this with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren W.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: My next question...","postDate":"1343499731","msgId":68431,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPQWQ5Tm9jS0pyeDdYRHJlQVB0PVhCVDc1TSt3S2l2RE1jc0tVM1dQUnlNZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUwNDUzNkIzLTE1M0EtNDQ2MS05NUNFLUE1MkM4M0ZDN0YxREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEE2NjVDNzJBLUUyNDUtNEY0RC04N0EwLUZCMjI2RDVBQTFFNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGp2MHVmNis5MTYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Q0FPT1RhWE41ZkQ0czl5WkM3UDY1eEItVmhaY3BGMHo1b2RfcnNaN2VGTWFHcnZYTFJRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8RTA0NTM2QjMtMTUzQS00NDYxLTk1Q0UtQTUyQzgzRkM3RjFEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68427,"nextInTopic":68449,"prevInTime":68430,"nextInTime":68432,"topicId":68396,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It doesn&#39;t, though, sound like unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not here to make people toe the unschooling line.

We&#39;re here to help people who&#39;ve already decided radical unschooling is what&#39;s right for them figure out how to make it work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list can also be useful for people who want to find out about unschooling. They can read. They can ask respectful question to clarify their understanding of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the list isn&#39;t a place for people to post ideas to get &quot;good idea/bad idea&quot; type of feedback. You&#39;re get &quot;moving in the direction of unschooling, but here&#39;s what will steer you more directly&quot; or &quot;moving away from unschooling, and undermining what you&#39;re supposedly here to move toward.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My husband, looking at the piece of paper I&#39;ve charted this out on:<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Where does [our son] get to choose? There&#39;s no room left for him to study what he wants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>An unschooler might ask the same question with &quot;explore&quot; rather than &quot;study&quot;. Study is focused and goal oriented. If someone steps off to explore something that catches their eye, takes a different path, they&#39;re &quot;wrong.&quot; For unschoolers, exploring can be a question, a 6 month plunge into living and breathing an interest, a book, talking to someone, dropping it for something else more interesting, picking it up again in 3 years or 15 years or never. For unschoolers interests, explorations -- and the learning that comes as a side effect from that -- are fluid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My husband: &quot;Do I look like I *care* what some checklist says he needs? I want him to have the choice of what he studies. I want him to take ownership of his education. He&#39;s said he wants to study computers. Let him fill his time with that. Find him classes at the community college. Just let him be in the driver&#39;s seat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It sounds like your husband wants to support Independent Study. It&#39;s more like what college is supposed to be: a place to fully focus on the study of a specific interest. (Though with so many kids pressured into college as the next mandatory step after high school, college can be not much different from high school :-/)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s what your son wants too, that would work for him.

But for kids who aren&#39;t wired like that, it would be as confining as school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling looks like doing whatever someone finds fun, interesting and challenging in a rich environment supportive of learning and who kids are. It can look like video games. It can look like talking with friends. It can look like reading through the encyclopedia ;-) (I was going to say Wikipedia, but I can&#39;t imagine anyone never clicking on a link. It would be incredibly stilted. Whereas it is possible to read a hard-copy encyclopedia in alphabetical order just for grins :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You can&#39;t not plan<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Anyone can.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can too. At first it would be hard. It would be easier each time you made a thoughtful deliberate choice to do something unplanned.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut change is incredibly hard if not done because someone sees the change helping them achieve some benefit they can&#39;t get by not changing. Every choice has it&#39;s pluses and minuses. Learning without planning involves letting go of some things you might value. Unless you see a value far greater in more free flowing exploration, it will make change very very hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you see value in free exploration, what&#39;s written on this list won&#39;t help you much.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My husband&#39;s philosophy is that our son has the rest of his life to meet<br/>\n&gt; college requirements if he&#39;s so inclined, and that they should not<br/>\n&gt; constitute a box that he is forced to live in.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet also not true. Your son can get into college without &quot;college requirements.&quot; Unschoolers are exploring hands on. They&#39;re learning by doing.

For people -- parents or kids -- who are still school-thinking, classes will be high on their list of ways to learn something. It&#39;s what they&#39;ve been trained to understand as learning. It *feels* like learning to them. It&#39;s what they&#39;ll think of first when they (or their child) wants to learn something. They will also believe they must prepare themselves with the basics before they can learn the stuff they&#39;re interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n(If mom or dad isn&#39;t confident in learning by freely exploring interests, they can be irritable as kids play hours of video games and text with their friends, then burst with excitement when a kid says they want to learn something that sounds like school or take a class. It doesn&#39;t take people-pleasing kids long to realize they&#39;re being &quot;good&quot; and making the &quot;right&quot; choices when they do something that looks like school.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce someone is free of the school mind-set, then taking a class is like watching a documentary. They&#39;re taking it because it sounded like a fun way to learn something they&#39;re interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking a Tae Kwon Do class is a lot more fun than learning from a book or a video.

There&#39;s no room left for him to study what he wants.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe, in a &quot;But you don&#39;t understand...&quot; tone of voice: &quot;He *has* to take this, and this, and this, and...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband: &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe: &quot;This is what he&#39;ll need in order to get into college.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband:  &quot;Do I look like I *care* what some checklist says he needs?  I want him to have the choice of what he studies.  I want him to take ownership of his education.  He&#39;s said he wants to study computers.  Let him fill his time with that.  Find him classes at the community college.  Just let him be in the driver&#39;s seat.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMe:  [Silence, pondering the significance of this and unable to deny the feeling of great freedom it gives both my son and me.]<br/>\n<br/>\nConventional wisdom says that this is lunacy.  You can&#39;t not plan.  But it feels right at the deepest levels.  My husband&#39;s philosophy is that our son has the rest of his life to meet college requirements if he&#39;s so inclined, and that they should not constitute a box that he is forced to live in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nLucy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68486,"nextTopicId":68488}}
