You say that <br/>\nthe times you hurt yourself were times when you were hurting emotionally <br/>\nand struggling for some kind of control.  I see this in my daughter. <br/>\n She&#39;s trying very hard to control her situations and the people <br/>\ninvolved.  So many people tell me how amazed they are at her vocabulary <br/>\nfor her age, but I think that for her, it&#39;s not enough.  She has two <br/>\nolder sisters who do everything together and one younger one who is just <br/>\nstarting to play with others, so essentially she&#39;s a middle child.  I <br/>\nthink she&#39;s feeling a great deal of frustration about this.  I do hope <br/>\nthat as my youngest gets older, these two girls will be as close as the <br/>\nolder two.  Perhaps then my dd won&#39;t feel so alone.  I also think she&#39;s <br/>\na person who will always have extremely high expectations of herself.  I <br/>\nwould just like to help guide her in setting her high goals while being <br/>\npatient with herself to attain them.

We have changed our lifestyle since becoming unschoolers, but not to a point of outright unparenting, which is what I suspect you read into","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1263378551\">Thank you, Mary.  We have changed our lifestyle since becoming <br/>\nunschoolers, but not to a point of outright unparenting, which is what I <br/>\nsuspect you read into it.  My comment on her perhaps picking up violence <br/>\nfrom movies was based on movies like Sinbad and other cartoon-types <br/>\nwhere someone gets killed.  Perhaps she&#39;s not ready for these things, <br/>\nbut she is interested in watching them and I feel it would be more <br/>\nharmful to forbid these things than to let her watch.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly, she hurts herself or threatens to when she doesn&#39;t get her way. <br/>\n An example would be if I don&#39;t do what she asked at just that moment, <br/>\nshe threatens to hurt herself.  If I get after her for doing something <br/>\ninapproriate to one of her sisters, she may threaten to kill herself. <br/>\n In reading that, you may think she&#39;s just spoiled.  The worry then is <br/>\nsometimes she actually will hurt herself.  Then older she gets, there <br/>\nare more ways she can hurt herself.  I can&#39;t always do as she demands. <br/>\n I can&#39;t punish her for hurting herself.  I haven&#39;e been able to stop <br/>\nher from hurting herself.  I have thought long and hard about what to do <br/>\nto help her learn to deal with impatience, anger, and frustration.  It <br/>\ncould be just a stage she&#39;s going through at 3 1/2.  What really bothers <br/>\nme is that she&#39;s been hurting herself since about 18 months.  It <br/>\ndefinitely wasn&#39;t from watching movies and tv then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve began a new strategy.  It&#39;s rather extreme and I really don&#39;t <br/>\nknow if it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but she hasn&#39;t hurt herself in <br/>\nover two weeks.  It began like this:  After one episode where she was <br/>\nyanking her hair and threatening to run out in the street to get hit by <br/>\na car, I say her on my lap and said that I loved her.  That every time <br/>\nshe got hurt, it hurt me because I love her so much.  I told her that I <br/>\ngave birth to her out of my tummy because I wanted her to be alive and <br/>\nto be happy.  Then I told her that because she couldn&#39;t see how much it <br/>\nhurt me when she hurt herself, I would show her.  From then on, whenever <br/>\nshe hurt herself, I would do the same thing to myself.  And I have.  The <br/>\nlast time she&#39;s hurt herself was at this computer.  She was upset <br/>\nbecause the game she was playing was too hard so she began to slam her <br/>\nknee on the edge of the desk.  So I did the same.  I ended up cutting my <br/>\nknee in two places and making a huge bruise.  I know this sounds awful <br/>\nand very dramatic and I guess it is.  But it made a huge impression on <br/>\nher.  She was very upset to see her mommy hurt.  I told her that&#39;s how <br/>\nupset I feel when she hurts herself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea if this is the right thing to do.  But it&#39;s all I could <br/>\nthink of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your insights.

I don&#39;t know you, however, I am wondering if it is possible that your child is crying out for some healthy boundaries and structure.   As an unschooling parent I like to follow my son&#39;s lead and support him in what he wishes to learn, however, at the same time it is still my job to protect hime, set healthy boundaries and provide a structure that supports his natural unfolding. I will censor the videos he watches until he is emotionally mature enough to handle the content, because early exposure has proven to cause distress in children.  Just talking about the content is not enough when the child is not emotinally mature enough to handle the content.  I will choose developmentally appropriate books, activities, etc... until such an age when he is emotionally mature enough to make those decisions himself.  This, i believe will occur in<br/>\n&gt; incremental steps, and be a wonderful learning experience for him.  It is not impeding his learning, nor dictating what he can or can not discuss, it is protecting him so that he is not overwhelmed so much that no real learning can take place. The difficulty is that  many of us (me) have experienced controlling boundaries growing up, that weren&#39;t boundaries at all, but rigid walls, rules that were dictator like rather than an obviously keeping us safe and secure.  Choosing the exact opposite of what we may have experience as a child is a reaction, and not really a choice at all, since it is so linked to our parent&#39;s behaviour.As a counselor i have often seen a swing in parenting styles from parents who grew up with too rigid boundaries in turn have little or no boundaries for their children.  Yet healthy structure and boundaries is an innate need of all children, and if they are not there the child tries to punish themselves, or expresses their distress in some other way. <br/>\n&gt; Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not knowing what is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the parent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.I have also witnessed that some kids need more structure than others in order for their day to go smoothly.  Unschooling, again, doesn&#39;t in my  opinion rule out structure in the day.  It is child centered, so it means understanding the specific needs of the individual child and then providing the support, nurturing and structure that best allows the child to grow in his own way.Like i said, I don&#39;t know if this is what is going on for you and your family,  but just in case my thoughts are helpful I thought i would share them with you.<br/>\n&gt;\t\t<br/>\n&gt;---------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!

I don&#39;t know you, however, I am wondering if it is possible that your child is crying out for some healthy boundaries and structure.   As an unschooling parent I like to follow my son&#39;s lead and support him in what he wishes to learn, however, at the same time it is still my job to protect hime, set healthy boundaries and provide a structure that supports his natural unfolding. I will censor the videos he watches until he is emotionally mature enough to handle the content, because early exposure has proven to cause distress in children.  Just talking about the content is not enough when the child is not emotinally mature enough to handle the content.  I will choose developmentally appropriate books, activities, etc... until such an age when he is emotionally mature enough to make those decisions himself.  This, i believe will occur in<br/>\n incremental steps, and be a wonderful learning experience for him.  It is not impeding his learning, nor dictating what he can or can not discuss, it is protecting him so that he is not overwhelmed so much that no real learning can take place.
