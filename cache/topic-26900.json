I homeschool my <br/>\n&gt;oldest of 2 girls, and will one day school the little one as <br/>\n&gt;well. My daughters are 10 and 1.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I am currently the moderator of a homeschool shoebox swap group, <br/>\n&gt;where each month members that would like to particpate are paired up <br/>\n&gt;with another family somewhere around the world. We then gather <br/>\n&gt;information from our home state/country, things like postcards, <br/>\n&gt;newspapers, rocks, maps, sand from a beach, etc... and then we <br/>\n&gt;exchange them with our swap family. It&#39;s a fun group, and neat to <br/>\n&gt;learn about a new place, while at the same time, learning quite a <br/>\n&gt;bit about our own state and/or country. We are a list of 81 <br/>\n&gt;homeschooling families, and at this time are putting the word out to <br/>\n&gt;other homeschooling families around the world in hopes that they <br/>\n </span></blockquote>will join us.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;I was wondering, if it&#39;s okay with you, if you could please pass on <br/>\n&gt;information about this group to your list? We would love to see <br/>\n&gt;our group grow. It&#39;s a fun way to learn a little about the world <br/>\n&gt;around us, and to meet new homeschoolers around the world.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;The group can be found <br/>\n&gt;here: <br/>\n&gt;&lt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/hsshoeboxs wap/&gt;http://groups. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>yahoocom/ group/hssh<br/>\noeboxswap/</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26875,"nextTopicId":26901}}
