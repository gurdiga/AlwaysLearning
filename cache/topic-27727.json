I was looking though <br/>\nsome books and came across a description of how engines worked and <br/>\nthought &quot;Oh, I should show this to the kids, its a Valuble <br/>\nResource&quot;. A little warning light flashed in my mind. The kids were <br/>\nhappily engaged in other persuits, neither one of them is really <br/>\ninterested in engines right now, and if they were they would both be <br/>\nhappier taking one apart than reading about it. Hmmmm - I sat down <br/>\nand read the book and felt better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother of my not-so-great reasons for wanting to &quot;present&quot; <br/>\nsomething to my kids is one of those bad old tapes saying &quot;this is <br/>\nImportant Information that Everone Needs&quot;. I&#39;m pretty good at <br/>\nspotting those - they mostly sound like my dad ;) Here&#39;s one from <br/>\njust the other day: the Backyardigans were singing a song around the <br/>\nword &quot;eureka&quot; and Ray wanted to know what it meant. So I told him. I <br/>\nthink I even mentioned it was Greek. I thought about telling the <br/>\nstory of ol&#39;what&#39;s his name in the bathtub - I could even hear my <br/>\ndad telling the story. But Mo wanted to sing the song and Ray was <br/>\nbusy on the computer. Neither of them was looking for more <br/>\ninformation. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  but there are so few resources<br/>\n&gt; that address a broad topic in a way I like or that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; age appropriate.  Both in history and in science,<br/>\n&gt; especially, I find that most books that try to cover a<br/>\n&gt; broad amount of information give either so much detail<br/>\n&gt; that it&#39;s overwhelming or gloss over so much that it&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; painfully simplified. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Who decides the information is overwhelming or oversimplified? Are <br/>\nyou looking at these books with your dd or on your own and deciding <br/>\n*for* her? I&#39;ve looked at adult anatomy books and websites with my <br/>\n5yr old - recently we&#39;ve been looking at adult chemistry and <br/>\nbiochemistry sites. She just adores drawings of molecules of all <br/>\nkinds. One day we spent the morning doing an image search <br/>\nof &quot;proteins&quot; and had a blast. Some of the information was waaaaaay <br/>\nover my head, let alone a 5yr old&#39;s, but she was fascinated. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of learning can come directly from normal daily activity. <br/>\nMo wants to know what everything is made of right now: cats, organs, <br/>\nmuscles, cells, proteins.... That was a natural progression of <br/>\ninterest for her. My part wasn&#39;t so much that of &quot;storyteller&quot; <br/>\nas &quot;librarian&quot; - I helped her find out where to look for what she <br/>\nwanted to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Classical history books for kiddos? any ideas?","postDate":"1168984478","msgId":27736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMTMxOS42Njg5Mi5xbUB3ZWI2MTEuYml6Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDgwMWM3MzliNyQ5YTg0MmI2MCQ0MDAxYThjMEBEYXZpZD4="},"prevInTopic":27735,"nextInTopic":27737,"prevInTime":27735,"nextInTime":27737,"topicId":27727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love Black Adder, but it s too wordy and referential for 9 year olds, I think.

When","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1269850846\">I&#39;m also a lurker, here.  My daughter&#39;s 5, and so I&#39;m<br/>\nmostly just soaking up information, squirreling it<br/>\naway for when I might need it as she gets older.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were researching educational philosophies and<br/>\nconsidering whether to put her in preschool a couple<br/>\nyears ago, I especially loved the storytelling<br/>\napproach that&#39;s found in the Waldorf schools -- where<br/>\nthe teacher (or, in this case, the parent) learns the<br/>\nmaterial, and then teaches through telling the stories<br/>\nfrom memory, rather than out of a book.  It keeps the<br/>\ninformation vibrant, and allows the adult to tailor<br/>\nthe angle of each telling to that particular group of<br/>\nkids.  There are so many things I want Sarah to be<br/>\nexposed to -- not necessarily to Learn the way she<br/>\nwould in school, but just to know that they&#39;re out<br/>\nthere if she wants to look more closely, to give her a<br/>\nreally wide, broad, *rich* base from which to start<br/>\nher own explorations -- but there are so few resources<br/>\nthat address a broad topic in a way I like or that&#39;s<br/>\nage appropriate.  Both in history and in science,<br/>\nespecially, I find that most books that try to cover a<br/>\nbroad amount of information give either so much detail<br/>\nthat it&#39;s overwhelming or gloss over so much that it&#39;s<br/>\npainfully simplified.  So I read up on the topic<br/>\nmyself (using high school or college textbooks,<br/>\nwikipedia, various library sources -- local librarians<br/>\nhave been great at pointing me at simple but thorough<br/>\nand accurate books for background research), think<br/>\nabout how to turn it into a good story for her, and<br/>\nthe next time we&#39;re doing storytelling, I&#39;ll pull it<br/>\nout.  If she&#39;s particularly interested in parts of it<br/>\nand asks questions, either I look that up in more<br/>\ndetail for another time, or I track down good books on<br/>\nthat detailed aspect (I find it easier to find a<br/>\ncouple great storybooks on specific Native American<br/>\nCreation stories than to find one great book on<br/>\ncomparitive religion for kids, for example).  And if<br/>\nit doesn&#39;t interest her, maybe I&#39;ll tell the story<br/>\nagain a few months later to see if things have changed<br/>\nor maybe I&#39;ll drop it entirely -- either way, though,<br/>\nI&#39;ve broadened my own knowledge base.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously working with one younger child is very<br/>\ndifferent from working with multiple older kids, but<br/>\nmaybe a similar approach would help you.  We love<br/>\nreading aloud or telling stories at night, it&#39;s such a<br/>\ngreat part of the rhythm of our days -- I&#39;d imagine<br/>\nit&#39;s got to be hard to find books to read aloud that<br/>\nwould keep kids of different ages and temperaments<br/>\nengaged.  Best of luck finding what you&#39;re looking<br/>\nfor!<br/>\n<br/>\n                      -- Elizabeth<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
