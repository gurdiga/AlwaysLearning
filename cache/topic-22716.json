Pam","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-577497211\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;I used to worry strongly about what would happen if I died, when my kids were<br/>\n&gt;eight and ten and unschooled.   I was very fearful of leaving the in the<br/>\n&gt;lurch partway through   the project.     But as each has turned 14, give <br/>\n&gt;or take a<br/>\n&gt;year, the whole worry flowed out of me regarding that child.    Each of them<br/>\n&gt;blossomed HUGELY right after the rough early puberty, and I think that right<br/>\n&gt;at this moment any of them would make it fine without parents.    I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;think the same of the schooled teens I know around me, who are suspicious and<br/>\n&gt;resentful of adults, who avoid eye contact and have learned to just say what<br/>\n&gt;they have to say to get adults to ignore them too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;My kids are, by contrast, direct and cheery, honest and responsible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Often I&#39;ll look at them through the lens of something I&#39;m reading about or<br/>\n&gt;thinking, or a period   movie I&#39;ve watched.   Could the boys be sailors or<br/>\n&gt;soldiers in they were in another place and time?   Easily.   They would be <br/>\n&gt;among<br/>\n&gt;the best, if they had good reason to go and do those things.   Either of <br/>\n&gt;them,<br/>\n&gt;right now, would make good parents.    Holly&#39;s still a little young, at <br/>\n&gt;13, but<br/>\n&gt;there are times in which she&#39;d&#39;ve been in the early stages of arranged<br/>\n&gt;marriages, and could she do that?   Yes.   She&#39;s physically young, but she&#39;s<br/>\n&gt;emotionally and mentally more aware of social issues and human factors <br/>\n&gt;than many<br/>\n&gt;adults, and she&#39;s not thinking maybe she understands it, she knows she has <br/>\n&gt;some<br/>\n&gt;clear understandings.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;She knows.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;That feeling of fakery and fraud that people have talked about for the past<br/>\n&gt;few decades seems absent in these kids.   What they don&#39;t know doesn&#39;t scare<br/>\n&gt;them, and what they do know is solid.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Sandra<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wow, Sandra, in the decade I&#39;ve been reading  your words, these are up <br/>\nthere on the list of those I&#39;ll remember.
