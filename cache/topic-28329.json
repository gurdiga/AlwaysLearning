My friends know I <br/>\nneed the basic addition practice -- still, I don&#39;t count up their <br/>\nturn&#39;s score, I just ask what it is and add it to the column.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh doesn&#39;t grasp that adding an &quot;s&quot; to the end of a word isn&#39;t as <br/>\ngood a play as making some other word that includes that &quot;s&quot; and <br/>\nputting it perpendicular.  He&#39;s as stubborn about playing word games as <br/>\nI am about math ones &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou reminded me of another incident from my weird youth; I was playing <br/>\nSolitaire (with cards ;-) and my dad commented that, if I could play <br/>\nSolitaire that well, why did I have so much trouble with math?<br/>\n<br/>\nI immediately got a migraine.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Scrabble","postDate":"1174863053","msgId":28329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDOTNENDcyRDZBMkFFNS0xMDA0LTE4OUNARldNLU0yOS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNzQ3NDc0NjEuOTM1LjIxNDc1Lm0xOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDExNzQ3NDc0NjEuOTM1LjIxNDc1Lm0xOUB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28330,"prevInTime":28328,"nextInTime":28330,"topicId":28329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
