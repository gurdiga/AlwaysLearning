Control is damaging and it  <br/>\ninterferes. If you want to control your children&#39;s lives and  <br/>\nunschool, you&#39;ll need to find ways to counter the effect of control  <br/>\non your own because people here have found ways to help their  <br/>\nchildren grow up healthy and sound without the control and we know  <br/>\nit&#39;s not necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I truly believe that we as parents have a biblical responsibility  <br/>\n&gt; to guard<br/>\n&gt; our childrens&#39; hearts and minds, not just &quot;let them&quot; put whatever  <br/>\n&gt; they want<br/>\n&gt; to into them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>By saying that, you&#39;re implying that we let our kids put whatever  <br/>\ninto themselves and don&#39;t care because our philosophy of freedom is  <br/>\nmore important than our kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will help you hear what we&#39;re saying if you believe that  <br/>\nwe care as much about our children&#39;s mental, physical and spiritual  <br/>\nhealth as you do. We&#39;ve just found a way to do it without controlling  <br/>\nthem and telling them what to do. We&#39;re their partners as they  <br/>\nexplore the world. We trust that they have needs we don&#39;t understand  <br/>\nand that they&#39;re exploring ways of meeting them. We&#39;re there to help  <br/>\nthem explore lots of different way. We trust that even though they  <br/>\nmay make choices for themselves that we wouldn&#39;t, that because  <br/>\nthey&#39;re being raised in a nurturing environment, that they don&#39;t want  <br/>\nto hurt themselves (though may put up with discomfort for a bit to  <br/>\ntry something out). They *are* seeking ways to be happy and healthy.  <br/>\nThey find those ways by freely exploring and feeling the negatives  <br/>\nand positives of their choices, sometimes putting up with the  <br/>\nnegatives to experience the positives. But they&#39;re not stupid. They  <br/>\nuse their heads and weigh and judge and do come to sound decisions as  <br/>\nthey grow because we&#39;ve trusted that they&#39;re capable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re also right here with them, helping them find ways to meet their  <br/>\nneeds and be safe and respectful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is easiest when they&#39;re little, when their choices involve  <br/>\nstaying up late, taking the big jump on their bikes, getting a toy  <br/>\nback from another child. When they&#39;re trusted early, there&#39;s no  <br/>\nreason to push the boundaries into areas many teens do when they have  <br/>\nthe power to do so (drinking and driving, drugs). Unschooled kids  <br/>\naren&#39;t perfect but they&#39;re poster children next to kids who&#39;ve been  <br/>\nraised under control.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes control always lead to rebellion? No, but it does a lot.  <br/>\nUnfortunately most people are convinced that when control fails it&#39;s  <br/>\nbecause they didn&#39;t control enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one&#39;s telling you to change your ideas. We are saying the ideas  <br/>\nyou&#39;re presenting won&#39;t be left to sit on the list without being  <br/>\ncountered. If you don&#39;t want them countered, don&#39;t bring them to the  <br/>\nlist. If you don&#39;t want to change, don&#39;t bring it to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ven though I would on occasion<br/>\n&gt; let them watch these shows, and sit and talk with them about why  <br/>\n&gt; they were<br/>\n&gt; not good attitudes, and why we should not treat people this way --  <br/>\n&gt; if that<br/>\n&gt; is what they are filling their minds with, they DO act that way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, kids try out behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve found works better than no, is passing on how it makes me  <br/>\nfeel. Kids *don&#39;t* want to hurt people but often don&#39;t know how to  <br/>\nget what they want without hurting someone. They need help not barriers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis topic has been discussed here on the list. People *have* found  <br/>\nways for their kids to be kind and respectful without controlling and  <br/>\neven without lecturing each time some bad behavior comes on the  <br/>\nscreen. We trust that they&#39;re thinking creatures that don&#39;t want to  <br/>\nhurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone *does* want to tackle the topic of behavior that kids are  <br/>\npicking up on tv and then trying out on their siblings, this is a  <br/>\ngreat place  to find respectful ways for kids to watch TV *and* be  <br/>\nnice. But it needs to be a current problem, not a hypothetical one.  <br/>\nKids have real reasons for what they do. Hypothetical kids can get  <br/>\n&quot;what if&#39;d&quot; to the point of ridiculousness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also don&#39;t see it as a good<br/>\n&gt; thing to expose them (at ANY age) to the constant commercialism and  <br/>\n&gt; the &quot;BUY<br/>\n&gt; BUY BUY&quot; attitude that is shoved into every 5-7 minutes of television.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>And yet unschoolers do have kids watching commercials and they aren&#39;t  <br/>\nhyperconsumers. (In fact the past couple of years it&#39;s been tough to  <br/>\nget my teen daughter to think up what to put on her Christmas list.)  <br/>\nControl isn&#39;t the only answer. (Control ultimately isn&#39;t even a good  <br/>\nanswer. Control might drive the immediate behavior out of sight, but  <br/>\nit pays for it with bigger problems in the future.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My husband and I have simply chosen that it does NOT need to<br/>\n&gt; be a daily focus in our household... and I am sure that we are  <br/>\n&gt; better off,<br/>\n&gt; as a family, for that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, lots of parents here began there. Lots of people were raised  <br/>\nthat way. *Everyone* is familiar with control. Yes, even gentle  <br/>\nloving control. The stories of the problems it created get discussed  <br/>\nhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have been struggling with him for years, and trying to<br/>\n&gt; figure out how to change my expectations and how to encourage him  <br/>\n&gt; to learn.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you can do both. Either you drop your expectations or  <br/>\ndrop trying to change him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate a nurturing environment. Help him feel comfortable with who he  <br/>\nis. Help him feel comfortable reaching out. Help him feel comfortable  <br/>\nnot reaching out. The more he feels you pushing, the harder he&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing to cling. Once you stop pushing that&#39;s when he&#39;ll start blooming.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see that my younger son is<br/>\n&gt; learning how to read, all by himself.

I would love my<br/>\n&gt; older son to have that sort of zeal.. and I GET IT, that it is my  <br/>\n&gt; fault<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you pushed him to read and do math, perhaps it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve cut off avenues he would have loved to explore, then  <br/>\nperhaps it is. (I really can&#39;t say enough about video games and math  <br/>\nand reading.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not all kids are into researching things. Now that she&#39;s a teen  <br/>\nmy daughter will research a few things and explore and discover on  <br/>\nher own, but other things -- especially things that might be labeled  <br/>\nacademic -- she&#39;d rather be shown or do it with someone who already  <br/>\nknows. But there are answers between pushing and standing back.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s walking by their sides discovering things together.

What does he love?<br/>\n<br/>\n13 *is* a tricky time. Often times they don&#39;t know what they like.  <br/>\n(And you do make it harder by cutting off chunks of the world that he  <br/>\ncould explore. I understand you have your reasons so you don&#39;t need  <br/>\nto tell us, but from experience unschoolers know that freedom (and  <br/>\nsupport while they explore) works much better for kids to find  <br/>\nthemselves than limitations do.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you&#39;ll need to find ways to run more of the world through his  <br/>\nlife. Take him to more of the world. (Even a new grocery store, an  <br/>\nethnic market.) Be okay when he says no thanks. Respect that, but  <br/>\nalso keep the doors open and keep opening new ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that&#39;s vague but your post about your son is vague too. 90% of  <br/>\nthe post is about you.

When she<br/>\nwatches scary movies, she&#39;s very analytical about them, she takes them<br/>\napart and dismantels them, expands on them, sometimes reads the books<br/>\nthey are based on and compares and critiques them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also watches movies and TV shows beyond her age and she doesn&#39;t<br/>\ndress or act in any way inappropriate.

Whereas several other parents I <br/>\nknow have been complaining to me about their teenage sons turning away from them and <br/>\nnot sharing their lives with them anymore, my son and I spend quality time together <br/>\neveryday--looking forward to what&#39;s on the agenda.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t even tell you all the conversation that has been stimulated--we make liberal use of <br/>\nthe pause button--I mean all the comparing, analyzing, dissection and belly laughing we <br/>\nhave shared, the connections that have been made--I wouldn&#39;t  trade our time for a <br/>\nmillion bucks!  And then there&#39;s the planning, discussing shows, comedians, actors, <br/>\npolitics, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sorry, now, for parents that hold on to their biases against modern media (t.v., <br/>\ncomputer, video games, etc.)  for all that they are missing out on.  I used to be in the &quot;fear <br/>\nt.v. because it is evil&quot; camp, until I decided to trust my children to be drawn to what is <br/>\nstimulating for them whether I understand it or not.  Until someone has made that shift, it <br/>\nis hard to really describe it--except to say that in my opinion, it is the place where the <br/>\nrelationship exists that everyone fantasizes that they will have with their children before <br/>\nthey are born, but then you don&#39;t because you are caught up in power struggles!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after an entire day of LARPing and winter gardening, we settled down to a few episodes <br/>\nof Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It&#39;s been a good day.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling Questions","postDate":"1226207524","msgId":40000,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0QzE1NTVGLTlDMTAtNDk5MC1BRTI2LTVBRDA5MjYyMjRGRkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxOWVlNThmMDgxMTA4MTg0M3g1ZTczNzNhMHg1YzExYmM0MDc0NThkZWRjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUxOWVlNThmMDgxMTA4MTg0M3g1ZTczNzNhMHg1YzExYmM0MDc0NThkZWRjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39996,"nextInTopic":40002,"prevInTime":39999,"nextInTime":40001,"topicId":39996,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Thank GOD I wasn t looking to you all to approve or validate my feelings about not having a television.-=- Please read this page before ever posting","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1850614016\">-=-Thank GOD I wasn&#39;t looking to you all<br/>\nto &quot;approve&quot; or validate my feelings about not having a television.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read this page before ever posting anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve read it, read it more slowly this time:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/alwayslearning\">http://sandradodd.com/alwayslearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou said you&#39;ve been watching this group for six months, but the  <br/>\nquestions you&#39;re asking and your responses sound like you&#39;re very new  <br/>\nor haven&#39;t been reading at all.

Years ago, I told the video store across  <br/>\nthe vacant lot from our house that it was okay with me for my kids to  <br/>\nrent R rated movies.  I made sure they put it in the notes of our  <br/>\naccount.  Holly turned 17 a week ago.  She can legally go into any R  <br/>\nrated movie now.  For her birthday she had asked for Grease and  <br/>\nGrease 2, and another family gave her a copy of Enchanted.  Tonight  <br/>\nshe was watching Follow that Bird.  The other day she and I and her  <br/>\nboyfriend went to see Zack and Miri make a Porno.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe presence of adult-themed movies doesn&#39;t destroy a healthy, strong  <br/>\nperson.  Being old enough to watch R rated movies made no difference  <br/>\nwith my kids.

When Holly visited him  <br/>\nlast summer, he turned her on to a Sesame Street song she hadn&#39;t  <br/>\nheard before, and she came home and asked me to find her a copy.  It  <br/>\nwas right on my computer and I threw it on a disk right then.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say is that your fears and negativity will do more  <br/>\ndamage than &quot;the &quot;BUY BUY BUY&quot; attitude and &quot;the teenage shows that  <br/>\npromote girls wearing tight short outfits and boys oogling over  <br/>\nthem.&quot;    You are afraid the sky is falling, and your thirteen year  <br/>\nold boy might feel like the sky has fallen on him.    Yet instead of  <br/>\nconsidering advice from people here whose teenaged boys are fine and  <br/>\nhappy and calm, you seem to be insulting us, insulting your son, and  <br/>\ndefending the stance and attitude that has not worked well up to this  <br/>\npoint.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have nothing to gain or lose from your decisions.

Thank GOD I wasn&#39;t looking to you all<br/>\nto &quot;approve&quot; or validate my feelings about not having a television.<br/>\n<br/>\nI truly believe that we as parents have a biblical responsibility to guard<br/>\nour childrens&#39; hearts and minds, not just &quot;let them&quot; put whatever they want<br/>\nto into them.  Do my children watch television, YES.  Do they watch movies,<br/>\nYES... But do they get to say &quot;I want to watch Friday the 13th&quot; and I go get<br/>\nit for them? NO.  Do they at seven, nine, or even thirteen years old<br/>\n*want*to watch the teenage shows that promote girls wearing tight<br/>\nshort outfits<br/>\nand boys oogling over them, or cartoons with disrespectful nasty attitudes<br/>\n---YES.  Am I responsible as a parent to not only SAY that might not be the<br/>\nbest choice, but to protect their hearts from that temptation since it is<br/>\nNOT good for the growth of their hearts?YES  Even though I would on occasion<br/>\nlet them watch these shows, and sit and talk with them about why they were<br/>\nnot good attitudes, and why we should not treat people this way -- if that<br/>\nis what they are filling their minds with, they DO act that way.  I have<br/>\nseen it in MANY children, NOT just my own.  I also don&#39;t see it as a good<br/>\nthing to expose them (at ANY age) to the constant commercialism and the &quot;BUY<br/>\nBUY BUY&quot; attitude that is shoved into every 5-7 minutes of television.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I did not write to this list to look for you to tell me &quot;that&#39;s<br/>\ngreat, you don&#39;t let your children watch television&quot; *or *for the opposite<br/>\nof that.  And, that just isn&#39;t true.  They do watch tv, and movies, and we<br/>\nenjoy them together, and they enjoy some that I prefer not to watch... and<br/>\nthat is fine.  My husband and I have simply chosen that it does NOT need to<br/>\nbe a daily focus in our household...  and I am sure that we are better off,<br/>\nas a family, for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did write asking for help with trying to figure out what to do FOR my<br/>\nthirteen year old.  I have been struggling with him for years, and trying to<br/>\nfigure out how to change my expectations and how to encourage him to learn.<br/>\nI have always struggled with him, and really it took me until I had a<br/>\nyounger boy, who is very self discovering and self teaching, to realize that<br/>\nIT IS ME that is holding my older son back.  I see that my younger son is<br/>\nlearning how to read, all by himself.  How to write, when it is important to<br/>\nhim, how to do math that he needs.  that when he wants to understand<br/>\nsomething, he asks and he is willing to search it out.  I would love my<br/>\nolder son to have that sort of zeal.. and I GET IT, that it is my fault -<br/>\ntotally - that he doesn&#39;t have that.  I am trying to figure out what to do<br/>\nfor him now, why he still has the chance to recover some, if only a little.<br/>\nI want to help him.  I want our relationship to get better.  We can sit for<br/>\nan hour or two talking.  he will help when I need him to help.  He is a<br/>\ngreat kid, and yes, it is my expectations that are getting in the way.  I<br/>\nfeel like he doesn&#39;t put any effort into learning anything.  but I am<br/>\nstarting to see differently as we are trying new and different things with<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to figure out how to NOT make the same mistakes with my other<br/>\nchildren, and how to help my oldest make the best of his own life.  I just<br/>\ndon&#39;t know where to start with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have four younger children, I can&#39;t just go off everyday and take the<br/>\noldest everywhere, and do things with only him.  So I have to figure out<br/>\nwhat I *can* do that will help HIM to be happiest, wholest, most fulfilled<br/>\nperson he can be.  I get it that damage has already been done.  trust me, I<br/>\nget that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also know that I might be able to help some of it heal, and I might not.<br/>\nbut if I can, I want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39909,"nextTopicId":40041}}
