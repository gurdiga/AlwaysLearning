She&#39;s training with her huskies that she saved from shelters.  She had been training down home by having them pull her and her daughter on skate boards and roller blades.    <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe dogs saw snow for the first time a couple weeks ago and what did they do?   They rolled in it.  &lt;g&gt;    It was a great story.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI just looked on the Beargrease marathon website and her race, which is the mid distance one, went off yesterday.    I hope she completes it!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nKelli<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nPS  Here in Bemidji, where I live, we had to postpone some races, not enough snow.   We have gotten a few inches this week though so we will probably have the races next weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nYahoo!
