It&#39;s a stunning finding<br/>\nthat has turned<br/>\nfive decades of stress research-most of it on<br/>\nmen-upside down.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Until this study was published, scientists generally<br/>\nbelieved that when<br/>\npeople experience stress, they trigger a hormonal<br/>\ncascade that revs the body<br/>\nto either stand and fight or flee as fast as<br/>\npossible,&quot; explains Laura<br/>\nCousino Klein, PhD, now an assistant professor of<br/>\nbiobehavioral health at<br/>\nPennsylvania State University in State College and one<br/>\nof the study&#39;s<br/>\nauthors. It&#39;s an ancient survival mechanism left over<br/>\nfrom the time we were<br/>\nchased across the planet by saber-toothed tigers. Now<br/>\nthe researchers <br/>\nsuspect<br/>\nthat women have a larger behavioral repertoire than<br/>\njust &quot;fight or flight.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, says Dr. Klein, it seems that when the<br/>\nhormone oxytocin is released<br/>\nas part of the stress response in a woman, it buffers<br/>\nthe fight or flight<br/>\nresponse and encourages her to tend children and<br/>\ngather with other women<br/>\ninstead. When she actually engages in this tending or<br/>\nbefriending, studies<br/>\nsuggest that more oxytocin is released, which further<br/>\ncounters stress and<br/>\nproduces a calming effect. This calming response does<br/>\nnot occur in men, says<br/>\nDr. Klein, because testosterone-which men produce in<br/>\nhigh levels when <br/>\nthey&#39;re<br/>\nunder stress - seems to reduce the effects of<br/>\noxytocin. Estrogen, she adds,<br/>\nseems to enhance it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe discovery that women respond to stress differently<br/>\nthan men was made in <br/>\na<br/>\nclassic &quot;aha!&quot; moment shared by two women scientists<br/>\nwho<br/>\nwere talking one day in a lab at UCLA. &quot;There was this<br/>\njoke that when the<br/>\nwomen who worked in the lab were stressed, they came<br/>\nin, cleaned<br/>\nthe lab, had coffee, and bonded,&quot; says Dr. Klein.<br/>\n&quot;When the men were<br/>\nstressed, they holed up somewhere on their own. &quot;I<br/>\ncommented one day to<br/>\nfellow researcher Shelley Taylor that nearly 90% of<br/>\nthe stress research is <br/>\non<br/>\nmales. I showed her the data from my lab, and the two<br/>\nof us knew instantly<br/>\nthat we were onto something.&quot; The women cleared their<br/>\nschedules and started meeting with one scientist after<br/>\nanother from<br/>\nvarious research specialties. Very quickly, Drs. Klein<br/>\nand Taylor<br/>\ndiscovered that by not including women in stress<br/>\nresearch, scientists had<br/>\nmade a huge mistake: The fact that women respond to<br/>\nstress differently than<br/>\nmen has significant implications for our health.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may take some time for new studies to reveal all<br/>\nthe ways that oxytocin<br/>\nencourages us to care for children and hang out with<br/>\nother women, but the<br/>\n&quot;tend and befriend&quot; notion developed by Drs. Klein and<br/>\nTaylor may explain <br/>\nwhy<br/>\nwomen consistently outlive men. Study after study has<br/>\nfound that social ties<br/>\nreduce our risk of disease by lowering blood pressure,<br/>\nheart rate, and<br/>\ncholesterol. &quot;There&#39;s no doubt,&quot; says Dr. Klein, &quot;that<br/>\nfriends are helping <br/>\nus<br/>\nlive longer.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIn one study, for example, researchers found that<br/>\npeople who had no friends<br/>\nincreased their risk of death over a 6-month period.<br/>\nIn another study, those<br/>\nwho had the most friends over a 9-year period cut<br/>\ntheir risk of death by <br/>\nmore<br/>\nthan 60%. Friends are also helping us live better. The<br/>\nfamed Nurses&#39; Health<br/>\nStudy from Harvard Medical School found that the more<br/>\nfriends women had, the<br/>\nless likely they were to develop physical impairments<br/>\nas they aged, and the<br/>\nmore likely they were to be leading a joyful life. In<br/>\nfact, the results were<br/>\nso significant, the researchers concluded, that not<br/>\nhaving a close friend or<br/>\nconfidante was as detrimental to your health as<br/>\nsmoking or carrying extra<br/>\nweight! And that&#39;s not all: When the researchers<br/>\nlooked at how well the <br/>\nwomen<br/>\nfunctioned after the death of  their spouse, they<br/>\nfound that even in the <br/>\nface<br/>\nof this bigger stressor of all, those women who had a<br/>\nclose friend and<br/>\nconfidante were more likely to survive the experience<br/>\nwithout any new<br/>\nphysical impairment or permanent<br/>\nYet if friends counter the stress that seems to<br/>\nswallow up so much of our<br/>\nlife these days, if they keep us healthy and even add<br/>\nyears to our life, why<br/>\nis it so hard to find time to be with them? That&#39;s a<br/>\nquestion that has<br/>\ntroubled researcher Ruthellen Josselson, PhD, coauthor<br/>\nof Best Friends: The<br/>\nPleasures and Perils of Girls&#39; and Women&#39;s Friendships<br/>\n(Three River<br/>\nPress,1998). &quot;Every time we get overly busy with work<br/>\nand family, the first<br/>\nthing we do is let go of friendships with other<br/>\nwomen,&quot; explains Dr.<br/>\nJosselson. &quot;We push them right to the back burner.<br/>\nThat&#39;s really a mistake,<br/>\nbecause women are such a source of strength to each<br/>\nother. We nurture one<br/>\nanother. And we need to have unpressured space in<br/>\nwhich we can do the <br/>\nspecial<br/>\nkind of talk that women do when they&#39;re with other<br/>\nwomen. It&#39;s a very <br/>\nhealing<br/>\nexperience.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

For me, that is Robin Hood, <br/>\n  Prince of Thieves, which I think is atrocious.  I walked out of it in the <br/>\n  theatre.  It was on TV the other night, and I watched some I had missed that <br/>\n  first night, and TRIED to watch it to the end, but the script and the acting <br/>\n  and the whole concept just irritated me beyond bearing, and I turned it off.  <br/>\n  If someone else had been watching too and been interested, I would have just <br/>\n  left the room instead and let them watch in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Can others add movies to this list?

When you get better at it, <br/>\nmore comfortable with what your child likes, knows, and wants to know, you <br/>\ncould find lots of value in just about any movie.  We had plenty to talk <br/>\nabout the other day with The Litte Princess, with Shirley Temple.  We talked <br/>\nLOTS about characterization and motivation and plot detail after the first <br/>\nNinja Turtle Movie, when the boys were little.  They have learned to milk a <br/>\nmovie for all it&#39;s worth, and I helped.  Marty came in halfway through Joe <br/>\nvs. the Volcano (which I bought at the fleamarket after someone quoted it <br/>\nhere, or at unschooling.com), and though I offered to rewind it, he was happy <br/>\nto just pick up where it was and fall into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow NOT to watch movies:<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be cynical and critical and dismissive.  Find the good acting, the good <br/>\nsets, the good props.  Don&#39;t say &quot;OH BROTHER.&quot;  If there&#39;s a movie you really <br/>\ndon&#39;t like, don&#39;t watch it with your kids.  For me, that is Robin Hood, <br/>\nPrince of Thieves, which I think is atrocious.  I walked out of it in the <br/>\ntheatre.  It was on TV the other night, and I watched some I had missed that <br/>\nfirst night, and TRIED to watch it to the end, but the script and the acting <br/>\nand the whole concept just irritated me beyond bearing, and I turned it off.  <br/>\nIf someone else had been watching too and been interested, I would have just <br/>\nleft the room instead and let them watch in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan others add movies to this list?  I&#39;ll just gather up a list and put it on <br/>\nthe web and when this discussion comes up again we can send people there for <br/>\nviewing ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5278,"nextTopicId":5309}}
