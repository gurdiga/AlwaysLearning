This is where those deluded into Secular Consumerism go<br/>\n&gt; and unwittingly take part in anti-Christian activities; this is where the<br/>\n&gt; Santamas propaganda and indoctrination are distributed; this is where the<br/>\n&gt; moral foundation of our society is being attacked; and this is where we<br/>\n&gt; as Christians must go to battle for the souls of the unsaved against the<br/>\n&gt; forces of Secularism.<br/>\n&gt; &quot;But surely malls are just places of commerce, not deliberate attempts to<br/>\n&gt; lead people away from Christ,&quot; you may be thinking to yourself.<br/>\n&gt; Unfortunately the facts point to the malls&#39; knowing complicity with the<br/>\n&gt; cause of anti-Christian Secularism. Besides the complete lack of<br/>\n&gt; Christian references in their so-called Christmas displays and<br/>\n&gt; decorations (just try and find a Cross or depiction of the Baby Jesus<br/>\n&gt; amongst all the Santas and snowmen and shiny balls), more subtle<br/>\n&gt; subconscious suggestions of Secularism&#39;s anti-Christian stance can be<br/>\n&gt; found by studying the names of common mall stores:<br/>\n&gt; J.C. Penny - The J.C. makes us think of Jesus Christ, thus associating<br/>\n&gt; our Lord with the lowest monetary value, the penny (even Judas valued Him<br/>\n&gt; at 30 pieces of silver!). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t that be DIMES, not pennies?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Sears - What the flesh of the damned does in Hell. It also sounds like<br/>\n&gt; &quot;seers&quot;, Pagan mystics who engaged in occult premonitions. <br/>\n&gt; Cinnabon - Sounds like &quot;Sin Upon&quot;. <br/>\n&gt; Orange Julius - Named for the Pagan Emperor of Rome. This company&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; mascot was once a devil, until they changed it to hide their true<br/>\n&gt; intentions. <br/>\n&gt; Hot Topic - A recent store aimed at children that openly sells devil<br/>\n&gt; paraphernalia. Any guess as to why &quot;hot&quot; is in their name? <br/>\n&gt; Hallmark Gold Crown Stores - Purveyors of Santamas tree ornaments<br/>\n&gt; depicting anthropomorphized woodland creatures (reference to<br/>\n&gt; Evolutionism) and Harry Potter merchandise. What notable person will have<br/>\n&gt; a mark and wear crowns? [Rev. 13:16, 13:1] <br/>\n&gt; Clearly there are ulterior motives evident. Even the word &quot;mall&quot; evokes<br/>\n&gt; evilness being a homonym for &quot;maul&quot; - the violent rending of flesh - and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;mal&quot; - Latin for &quot;bad&quot; and root for words like &quot;malicious&quot; and<br/>\n&gt; &quot;malevolent&quot;. These Malls of the Damned - open even on Sunday! - are no<br/>\n&gt; innocent business centers, but active parties in the conspiracy to<br/>\n&gt; promote Secularism.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Funny, I am an atheist AND I hate malls---how do they figure ME into the <br/>\nequation?????<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, smirking!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16196,"nextTopicId":16201}}
