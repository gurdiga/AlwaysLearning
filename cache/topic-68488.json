I do know that paper can and does cut skin, but I doubt it would have happened in those circumstances. Is trying so see if a piece of paper will fly like a Frisbee really the same as throwing a toy or other object? Especially when they&#39;ve just been blowing feathers with straws and had other small, light things flying through the air....I see the difference, but I can understand the lines blurring for him.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is that kind of behavior possibly the reason the therapist is using &gt; baby toys?

And I -totally- agree with you that it&#39;s not so cool for him to tip chairs. But if that&#39;s the worst thing he does in her office, he&#39;s acting WAY better than he did a year ago. Not in speech therapy appointments - he&#39;s usually fairly good there - but in general.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He shouldn&#39;t be throwing people in anyone&#39;s office, ever again, in his whole life, whether it&#39;s a rule or not.<br/>\n&gt; And she shoudln&#39;t need to say &quot;don&#39;t throw anything.&quot;  He should be prepared to go to an office by now (if he&#39;s been going for years) and know not to tip chairs or throw things. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you for helping me sort this out in my own head, Sandra. I think he was, mostly, prepared to follow the old speech therapist&#39;s expectations. She wouldn&#39;t have objected to the flying sheet of paper.

He talks in complete, complex sentences with a huge vocabulary and correct grammar....but there are something like 40 sounds that he&#39;s not capable of making. As I understand it, the muscles in his mouth and tongue just aren&#39;t able to do it yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the past three or four years, he&#39;s been in speech therapy. First, it was with a therapist through our HMO who pretty much wrote him off because we were limited to 20 visits over his lifetime and she felt that he was going to wind up getting services through the school district anyway. That lasted about a year, with me spacing out the appointments as far as I could get away with and working with him at home. We spent the entire time working on the letter P, with no results.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, we changed insurance and started getting therapy through a private children&#39;s therapy center. Our current insurance coverage (which is awful for everything else) allows for unlimited speech therapy, so we&#39;ve been going every week for the past two years. His second speech therapist was fantastic. Instead of telling him how to shape his lips and expecting him to do it, she had him doing all sorts of oral motor development -- blowing bubbles, chewing on stale licorice, sucking applesauce through thinner and thinner straws... he adored her, and she was great with him.   If I thought I heard him making a new sound and asked her if she heard it too, she&#39;d drop her plans for the day and switch sounds to take advantage of his new ability.    <br/>\n<br/>\nLast month, she quit without warning because her husband had accepted a new job offer across the country. So now we have a new speech therapist, the one the children&#39;s therapy center just hired.  We&#39;ve had three appointments, and I&#39;ve been biting my tongue through all of them.  I&#39;m the only parent they have who sits in on every single session (as far as I know, I&#39;m the only one who sits in on Any appointment -- most seem to drop their kids off and head to the grocery store) so I&#39;m trying to tread lightly. <br/>\n<br/>\nQuinn still seems to be enjoying his appointments, but thinks she treats him like a baby. Which she does. They&#39;re playing with actual baby/toddler toys. She seems to be adjusting that a bit, so I&#39;m being patient about that. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t seem to be listening to him. They were doing a puzzle with farm animals and she was having him name each animals. When it was a pig, he called it &quot;bacon&quot;...the sheep was &quot;wool for a sweater&quot;....the fish was &quot;sushi&quot; It seemed to me like she was listening for the &quot;P&quot; sound in pig, so she tuned out what he did say. To be fair, Quinn can be really hard to understand, but it seems like if he&#39;s telling her something when she wants another answer, she hushes him and gets along with her own agenda. So I&#39;ve been translating for him.  If she&#39;s trying to listen, I keep my mouth shut, but if she&#39;s ignoring something he actually said, I repeat it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other concern...frustration...whatever... is the way she tells him not to do things. Not that she tells him not to do it, but the way she does it, which Quinn seems to take as a personal challenge. On our second appointment, he&#39;d been gluing pieces of paper to a larger piece of cardstock. When he handed it to me to take home with us, he tried to toss it like a Frisbee to see if it would fly. The speech therapist launched into a lecture about how the edge of the paper could have cut my cheek...and Quinn launced into an argument about how paper can&#39;t cut people&#39;s skin....

She&#39;d stand a better chance by just saying &quot;don&#39;t tip the chair&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t throw anything.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I stay out of it and let the two of them work it out? Pull him into my own lap and physically prevent chair tipping? Suggest she talk to him a different way? (His last speech therapist would&#39;ve moved him to the floor on a beanbag, but this one seems to have a definite agenda in mind and not be willing to deviate from it, even when an easy change would make things go more smoothly)  I&#39;m going to remind him before his appoinment that tipping chairs and throwing things really upsets M, which I hope might help with those two problems, but he&#39;s likely to come up with some new and unexpected way to break the rules. <br/>\n<br/>\n(His father wants him in speech therapy, so quitting isn&#39;t an option. And, so far, Quinn has really enjoyed his appointments, even with the awful therapist we first started out with. This is the only provider covered by our insurance, so I can&#39;t switch therapists. It&#39;s in our best interest to make this work out the best I possibly can.) <br/>\n<br/>\nMichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68396,"nextTopicId":68502}}
