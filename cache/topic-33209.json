She literaly planned her day around this show and had to dvr it if we were going to be out. <br/>\n  Well she started having some nightmares and prefered sleeping in the living room . She&#39;d come get me and we&#39;d talk and snuggle if she woke up in the middle of the night. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Without a word from me she stopped watching the show.Maybe she got enough reassurance that Id always be there to help her handle whatever it is. Maybe she came to the conclusion that the show was to much for her. Maybe she simply found something more appealing to do and making sure to watch her show at 1 became unimportant. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Its instinct to want to protect our children but we cant protect them so much that they arent able to grow. <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nNever miss a thing.

We just started the online part. He&#39;s been playing halo 1, 2,<br/>\nand 3 and really enjoying himself and it&#39;s good and fun. <br/>\nBoth me and my partner have played with our son--I&#39;m really bad at it,<br/>\nbut we laugh and shoot and basically have a good time. We don&#39;t have<br/>\nlimits on how long anyone plays; and we know the value of food and<br/>\nwater during a lengthy game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now, we are delving into the world of online friends, and I&#39;m<br/>\nhaving the most ridiculous fears come up in me. I feel kind of like I<br/>\nwant to protect my son from - what? - bullies, I guess, or older folks<br/>\nwho could be mean or...feeling pressured to play some of the scarier<br/>\nlandscapes. (my son has a huge fear of spiders). <br/>\nBut what I&#39;ve noticed him actually DOING is leaving a game he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nlike and not talking into his headset first to hear how the other<br/>\nplayers are--if they&#39;re nice or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe had a really scary nightmare this morning and was all upset about<br/>\nit.

So I whispered to him if<br/>\nthat was ok or if it was too scary and he said no, he was having fun.<br/>\nSo I let it go. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;m still having these temptations to do some dumb, unthinking<br/>\nthing to quell MY fears that would probably not be helpful or<br/>\nsupportive of my son&#39;s new online fun. I have these &quot;what if&quot;<br/>\nscenarios that come up  and make me think I blew it by letting him<br/>\neven play Halo online.<br/>\nSo, the reason I&#39;m bringing it up here is because I need help thinking<br/>\nthis through.
