There is a big section on wet-nursing in France in the 1700&#39;s. The statistic she gives is this: of the 21,000 births in Paris in 1780, only 5 percent of them were nursed by their own mothers. Infant mortality rates were really high with under this system. There were actually public service sorts of messages encouraging women to breast feed their own children. <br/>\n<br/>\nHrdy examines the reasons behind sending your child off--only the wealthiest could afford in-home wet nurses, so most the infants of the middle class would be sent to the country to a wet-nurse--and in part concludes that it was because the income or the unpaid labor of the mother was pivotal to her families well-being. Much the same reason why many mothers chose to send their children away now. It was also a way to have more babies. For the wealthy who could afford to have a live in wet-nurse children survived 80 percent of the time, the same as if they were breastfed by their mother. There was also a greater likelihood for a daughter to be sent to be wet-nursed and a son to be kept at home. Certainly first born son&#39;s were most likelihood to be kept at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is another demonstration of the wonderful luxury and boon that I have in my life.

The conversation wasn&#39;t strictly polite. It&#39;s a mean reference. It&#39;s from 1943. I went looking for the quote on-line. I don&#39;t have the book anymore. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the whole section: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Gussie, a boy of six, was a murky legend in the neighborhood. A tough<br/>\nlittle hellion, with an overdeveloped under lip, he had been born like<br/>\nother babies and nursed at his mother’s great breasts. But there all<br/>\nresemblance to any child, living or dead, ceased. His mother tried to<br/>\nwean him when he was nine months old but Gussie wouldn’t stand for it.<br/>\nDenied the breast, he refused a bottle, food or water. He lay in his<br/>\ncrib and whimpered. His mother, fearful that he would starve, resumed<br/>\nnursing him. He sucked contentedly, refusing all other food, and lived<br/>\noff his mother’s milk until he was nearly two years old. The milk<br/>\nstopped then because his mother was with child again. Gussie sulked and<br/>\nbided his time for nine long months. He refused cow’s milk in any form<br/>\nor container and took to drinking black coffee.<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle Tilly was<br/>\nborn and the mother flowed with milk again. Gussie went into hysterics<br/>\nthe first time he saw the baby nursing. He lay on the floor, screaming<br/>\nand banging his head. He wouldn’t eat for four days and he refused to<br/>\ngo to the toilet. He got haggard and his mother got frightened. She<br/>\nthought it wouldn’t do any harm to give him the breast just once. That<br/>\nwas her big mistake. He was like a dope fiend getting the stuff after a<br/>\nlong period of deprivation. He wouldn’t let go.He took all of his mother’s milk from that time on and Little Tilly, a sickly baby, had to go on the bottle.<br/>\n<br/>\nGussie<br/>\nwas three years old at this time and big for his age. Like other boys,<br/>\nhe wore knee pants and heavy shoes with brass toe tips. As soon as he<br/>\nsaw his mother unbutton her dress, he ran to her. He stood up while<br/>\nnursing, an elbow on his mother’s knee, his feet crossed jauntily and<br/>\nhis eyes roving around the room. Standing to nurse was not such a<br/>\nremarkable feat as his mother’s breasts were mountainous and<br/>\npractically rested in her lap when released. Gussie was indeed a<br/>\nfearful sight nursing that way and he looked not unlike a man with his<br/>\nfoot on a bar rail, smoking a fat pale cigar.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe neighbors found<br/>\nout about Gussie and discussed his pathological state in hushed<br/>\nwhispers. Gussie’s father got so that he wouldn’t sleep with his wife;<br/>\nhe said that she bred monsters. The poor woman figured and figured on a<br/>\nway to wean Gussie. He was too big to nurse, she decided. He was going<br/>\nfor four. She was afraid his second teeth wouldn’t come in straight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne<br/>\nday she took a can of stove blackening and the brush and closed herself<br/>\nin the bedroom where she copiously blackened her left breast with the<br/>\nstove polish. With a lipstick she drew a wide ugly mouth with<br/>\nfrightening teeth in the vicinity of the nipple. She buttoned her dress<br/>\nand went into the kitchen and sat in her nursing rocker near the<br/>\nwindow. When Gussie saw her, he threw the dice, with which he had been<br/>\nplaying, under the washtubs and trotted over for feeding. He crossed<br/>\nhis feet, planted his elbow on her knee and waited.<br/>\n“Gussie want tiddy?” asked his mother wheedingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n“Yup!”<br/>\n<br/>\n“All right. Gussie’s gonna get nice tiddy.”<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly<br/>\nshe ripped open her dress and thrust the horribly made-up breast into<br/>\nhis face. Gussie was paralyzed with right for a moment, then he ran<br/>\naway screaming and hid under the bed where he stayed for twenty-four<br/>\nhours. He came out at last, trembling. He went back to drinking black<br/>\ncoffee and shuddered every time his eyes went to his mother’s bosom.<br/>\nGussie was weaned.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mother reported her success all over the<br/>\nneighborhood. It started a new fashion in weaning called, “Giving the<br/>\nbaby the Gussie.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"breastfeeding was influence: neither bad or good","postDate":"1235290666","msgId":42331,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4ODgxLjk5NzkucW1Ad2ViODYyMTAubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":42338,"prevInTime":42330,"nextInTime":42332,"topicId":42331,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It was unusual in Boston.
