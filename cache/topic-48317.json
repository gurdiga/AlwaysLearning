They&#39;re investigative questions to help you  <br/>\nfigure out what the cause is and think more clearly rather than  <br/>\nthrough fear. Your fear has connected &quot;free internet access&quot; to porn  <br/>\nbut there are more factors involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet doesn&#39;t spontaneously show kids porn. (Sounds like a  <br/>\nscience fiction plot!) If porn is coming up, there&#39;s a reason for it.  <br/>\nI have safe search turned off on Google&#39;s image search and I&#39;ve never  <br/>\nseen animal sex or rape (not sure that there&#39;s non-cruel rape).  <br/>\nCertain innocent search terms, like kitten for example, though, do  <br/>\ntend to bring up sexual images.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very easy to turn &quot;Safe Search&quot; on. Top right hand corner of  <br/>\nGoogle is Settings. Click on Search settings. Click on the radio  <br/>\nbutton next to SafeSearch Filtering. (I assume other search engines  <br/>\nhave a similar setting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut rather than seeing your role as being a barrier between your  <br/>\nchildren and the nasty world, see yourself as their partner who helps  <br/>\nthem get what they want *and avoid what they don&#39;t want*. See the  <br/>\nworld through your kids&#39; desires. What do *they* want? (Not the same  <br/>\nas what your fear wants to limit them to!) As any free person does,  <br/>\nthey want to search freely without someone deciding for them what  <br/>\nthey&#39;re allowed and not allowed to see. They also, like any free  <br/>\nperson, want to avoid what they don&#39;t want to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo your kids *want* to see sexual images? I&#39;m betting they&#39;d prefer  <br/>\nto avoid them! So, help them avoid it while giving them the freedom  <br/>\nto explore.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":304763189,"authorName":"cookiesforthree@verizon.net","from":"&quot;cookiesforthree@...&quot; &lt;cookiesforthree@...&gt;","profile":"cookiesforthree@verizon.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Internet access","postDate":"1257217765","msgId":48341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhjbzZ0NStlcHVoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3NDAyNUZDLTQ2MTYtNEU0RC1BNDdGLUE3Q0NBQTkwMzM2Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48339,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":48340,"nextInTime":48342,"topicId":48317,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think the article that I read about how you and Marty dealt with internet porn was fantastic.
