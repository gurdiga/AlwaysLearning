But I have grappled with why these instincts<br/>\nhaven&#39;t always served me well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point seems to be that our instincts can affect our judgements for<br/>\nbetter or for worse. When we parent they can pull us away from where the<br/>\npeaceful part of us wants to go.

I think it helps to work out which way your instincts<br/>\nare inclined and be open to nudging those instincts towards something less<br/>\norderly. It has helped me to hear that there are others out there who<br/>\nrecognise that it is not a case of rejecting your instincts that don&#39;t<br/>\nalign well with unschooling, but to have the awareness that by listening to<br/>\nyour children, you have the choice to over-ride your instincts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":363268824,"authorName":"keeliereader","from":"&quot;keeliereader&quot; &lt;keeliebean@...&gt;","profile":"keeliereader","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Swimming lessons","postDate":"1375352412","msgId":71837,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt0ZGNvcytpcG1tQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNzUzMDA2ODYuNzE2OTMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MjEwNC5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":71836,"nextInTopic":71845,"prevInTime":71836,"nextInTime":71838,"topicId":71792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From reading all your replies, it s clear that I totally bought into the idea of needing lessons to learn to swim.

I don&#39;t think it really occurred to me that he could learn on his own. Plus, as some of you mentioned, Australia really pushes swimming lessons from a young age so I got swept along with that. I don&#39;t know any kids of Jack&#39;s age that aren&#39;t in swimming lessons right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked about it today and I explained that lots of people learn without lessons - including his dad. I offered to take him swimming every week instead of lessons. Jack is not convinced that he will learn without lessons. He said it&#39;s the blowing bubbles bit that he hates so I suggested I ask the teacher specifically not to ask him to do that and we&#39;ll see how that goes. But he knows he is free to cancel the lessons at any time. We also went swimming today, just him and I and played in the pool for two hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis has been a very interesting thread for me as Jack is not school age yet and it has been my first proper experience of seeing and questioning my own schoolish thinking.

The youngest wanted to take surfing lessons and<br/>\nI told her in order to do so I would feel more comfortable if she were a<br/>\nstronger swimmer and that they have classes to help learn techniques. They<br/>\nare both enjoying and thriving. Step back to last year, she was terrified<br/>\nof letting go of me. Every time we were in water she held on for life. So<br/>\nwe went to a lot of pools (husband travels a lot and we spend quite a bit<br/>\nof time in hotels). She gradually got more confident, and we had a new baby<br/>\nso when I couldn&#39;t hold her we just let her play on the steps. She now<br/>\nswims for a bit, but gradually sinks, but unlike last year she loves water<br/>\nand loves the beach. Our eldest wasn&#39;t ever fearful, but wore floaties and<br/>\nonce she grabbed a pair of goggles, it distracted her enough to begin to<br/>\nswim (once she was tall enough to stand when needed).<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like kids learn how to manipulate their bodies in water, learning to<br/>\nswim underwater and doggie paddling naturally if exposed. Swimming lessons<br/>\ncan be good for technique if it peaks someone&#39;s interest. But at our class<br/>\nright now we have a 4 year old who is terrified and it pains me to watch<br/>\nbecause that was my daughter last year, and yet with just exposure she&#39;s<br/>\ncomfortable, no forcing involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is yet another example of a kid forced to take classes, got a<br/>\nswimming ache (his way of saying I don&#39;t want to do this anymore), and now<br/>\nhe&#39;s awkward in water. But exposure is probably more likely the culprit<br/>\nthan classes, his mom can&#39;t swim (hence the forced classes), and she hates<br/>\nbeing wet, so his experience never went beyond classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie, girls 5 & 7, little boy 1<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jul 30, 2013 7:14 PM, &quot;Michelle&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:helbywasher@...\">helbywasher@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My son wanted to go to swimming lessons when he was seven.

Try not to rush him into feeling okay about his level of comfort in the water.  Be patient!  Have fun playing in the water and it might come easily and without effort or pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I&#39;m interested in hearing about experiences of your own kids &gt;learning to swim but also this situation of pushing kids &#39;for their &gt;own good&#39;.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Though my daughter took an occasional swim class with short sessions when she was young and my son took a session at the  Ymca once, they both learned to swim outside of those classes by swimming and playing in the water for fun.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy other daughter (age 8) learned to swim on her own because we went swimming often.  She has been passing the swim test at the Y for a year or two now, but still hasn&#39;t yet passed a more difficult swim test at a different local pool that requires your arms to come out of the water for each crawl stroke.  That is something she wants to be able to do someday as she would like to be able to swim in that pools deep end.  I won&#39;t push her to take lessons so she can do this though.  I can offer to show her the crawl stroke, but she&#39;ll choose whether or not she wants to practice it and whether or not and how often she wants to take the swim test.    <br/>\n<br/>\nMy four year old son still doesn&#39;t swim yet, but he loves going to the pool, beach or lake and I know he will eventually swim too.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it ever okay in a learning situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Think about it like this.  Would you like others to try to force you to learn something (for what they think) is for your own good?  What if you didn&#39;t see it as necessary and the other person did?  Would that make it right?  Could that affect how much you trust and listen to yourself in more than one area of your life?    <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We talk a lot at home about our bodies belonging to us and making &gt;decisions about our own bodies, and then he goes to a class where the &gt;teacher&#39;s words and actions suggest that he has no control over his &gt;own body. I am not comfortable with that but I&#39;m still unsure as to &gt;whether it&#39;s okay since this method seems to work with most kids? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you really only care about whether or not a method works?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he wants to, you could let him keep going to the class and trying what the teacher asks.  Or keep going to the class and talking to the teacher about anything that feels uncomfortable and letting him handle it with her as long as he seems okay with it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr if you think he may feel uncomfortable even though he looks fine, ask the teacher again not to coax him at all, but only to offer.  Or sit closer (if that would be okay) so you can see and hear and intervene if necessary.  After each class, you can find out from your son how things went and decide to keep going or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he goes back to the class, could you make up a hand signal that he could sign back to you to indicate he is doing okay?  And one that means I want to leave or I need mom&#39;s help to talk to the teacher?  That might help you to know how he&#39;s doing and also might let him feel he has a way out if he&#39;s feeling uneasy about saying no to something requested of him in class.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLaurie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279351397,"authorName":"Chanda Rickard","from":"Chanda Rickard &lt;rickardcr@...&gt;","profile":"rickardcr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Swimming lessons","postDate":"1375206972","msgId":71820,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzUyMDY5NzIuODIwNC5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIxMTA0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":71819,"nextInTopic":71823,"prevInTime":71819,"nextInTime":71821,"topicId":71792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have four kids ages 12-2 years old.  The boys (12 and 10) have learned to swim just by going to the lake or pool a lot every summer.  They ve never had","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-292985663\">I have four kids ages 12-2 years old.  The boys (12 and 10) have learned to swim just by going to the lake or pool a lot every summer.  They&#39;ve never had formal swimming lessons, but both can swim and are comfortable in the water.  I&#39;ve never pushed them.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 7 yr. old daughter is getting there.  Once again, on her own time table.  She holds her breath and goes under water, she tries to doggy paddle, she&#39;ll go up to her chin, if I let her.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe toddler isn&#39;t afraid of water either.  She&#39;s a long way off, but I just don&#39;t see them point in swimming lessons, if we go swimming so much and they&#39;re learning just by exposure.  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Swimming lessons","postDate":"1375206775","msgId":71816,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt0OHVobitoczlkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGt0NnMyaituMHF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71811,"nextInTopic":71817,"prevInTime":71815,"nextInTime":71817,"topicId":71792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************* One of the downsides of swimming lessons is that they often start out by pushing kids to put their faces in the water - which is the Last","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-825431720\">&quot;keeliereader&quot; &lt;keeliebean@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; After the first lesson my son told me had not wAnted to blow bubbles<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the downsides of swimming lessons is that they often start out by pushing kids to put their faces in the water - which is the Last thing a lot of kids want to do.

But, I don&#39;t  think they learn BECAUSE of those lessons, but in spite of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, swimming really exemplifies unschooling. I&#39;ve watched lots of children go through swim lessons for years, making seemingly little progress before finally &quot;being taught&quot; to swim thanks to all of their hard work and the excellent teachers. It&#39;s easy to see why parents think you need swim lessons to learn to swim - look how hard it was for all of those kids! But, I&#39;ve also watched my own kids learn to swim all on their own. And, it wasn&#39;t hard for them at all because they learned when they were ready because they wanted to. It reminds me of reading -  all the work schools do vs. kids learning on their own when they are ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son learned when he was 3 1/2 by watching a bigger boy swim underwater and copying him. My daughter just after 3 learned by asking to swim between adults with us catching her. They are 7 and 10 and good swimmers now who can swim wherever they want in the pool, dive off the boards, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, my son wanted to learn the actual strokes, so we hired a teenager from swim team to work with him, and I stayed with him to make sure it was a good fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning to swim is about time in the water, so the more time you spend playing in the water, the more comfortable he will become. I&#39;ve never seen a young kid who spent a summer at our pool not learn to swim. More than once a week would speed the process along.

By playing in the water and lots of exposure.<br/>\nKids that have a lot of exposure to water will learn  by pushing their limits when they are ready.<br/>\nI remember tiptoeing until the water was in my nose. I remember swimming from one wall of the pool to the other and then farther and farther until I could go and go. <br/>\nI am a really strong swimmer. I also later on in my teens and 20&#39;s used to do bodyboarding.<br/>\nLast Summer a friend of mine&#39;s daughter went to the pool with us and was terrified of the water. She was 8 years old and the pool was shallow enough that she could stand.<br/>\nHer mom decided to join our health club and spend the Summer going to the pool with us as much as she could. Her daughter in a month was swimming under water just by playing.<br/>\nBoth my kids learned by playing and pushing their limits as they felt comfortable.<br/>\nI have seen kids that do classes to learn to swim and it is not that I am against them  but those kids are pushing limits that they are not ready to. They are going against what they feel is safe for them. <br/>\nI hear about people that  drown and were considered good swimmers and I wonder if they were pushing their limits way past their abilities and did not know when to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband did swimming lessons and &quot;graduated &quot; from swim school as a child. He is absolutely not comfortable in the water. You can tell by watching him in the water and swimming. A few years ago he got a swimming coach and thought about doing Thriathlons as he does Duathlons. He did a  lot of work with this great coach but decided to stop. He never got comfortable in the water. <br/>\nIn my experience as someone who is very very comfortable in the water and a great swimmer ( I also did Diving) is that panic is what causes most drownings. <br/>\nI have had a few difficult moments under water and kept it all safe by being really calm and cool about it even when I could not breath.<br/>\nI say it is because I pushed my limits on my terms and learned about what I can handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband, in the other hand, was made to take lessons for years and  he can swim but I would be very worried about him in any kind of situation that is a little difficult in the water. You can just tell by watching him swim no matter how perfect his strokes are.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky ( who is a fish in the water )<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":522719163,"authorName":"sukaynalabboun","from":"&quot;sukaynalabboun&quot; &lt;sukaynalabboun@...&gt;","profile":"sukaynalabboun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Swimming lessons","postDate":"1375185942","msgId":71808,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt0OGE2bStscGpkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEM0QjkxNTRBLUQzQ0ItNEEyMC05OEI2LTUwNjFDQkFDOTExQkB5bWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":71807,"nextInTopic":71809,"prevInTime":71807,"nextInTime":71809,"topicId":71792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My three daughters have all learned to swim on their own- sometimes asking me for help while I watch their progress.

I would never say it is worth it to disregard a child&#39;s firm &quot;no&quot; for the benefit of lessons. What is the real lesson being taught?  My oldest (15) swims better than the lifeguards; they even say so- and she learned this way and over several successive summers.

She will be seven in a few days and has just recently been able to swim about 15 meters on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has happened gradually. Having a snorkel and mask helped her a lot. We went snorkeling in the Red Sea when she was four and was still using armbands. <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil about a month ago, she thought she could only swim without armbands if she had her snorkel and mask, but when we got to the UK she wasn&#39;t allowed to use it and she discovered she could swim without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was such a joyful experience for her and for me to witness that she could swim all by herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwimming for her has always been about fun. If she has ever been fearful, like getting water up her nose or in her eyes and getting panicked, we have stopped being in the water. It was a no brainier. If she wasn&#39;t enjoying it, there was no point carrying on.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son will do everything when he is ready and in my opinion may now need done recovery time in light of what has happened with this teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 29 Jul 2013, at 23:58, &quot;keeliereader&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keeliebean@...\">keeliebean@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We started swimming lessons last year at my son&#39;s request.

It was gradual, and the more time we spent in the water, the faster the progress.  Neither of them has wanted formal lessons- and so they can swim safely, but they have never learned proper strokes or form.  They are not strong swimmers, and aren&#39;t too interested in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger two are 4 and 2.  I can see that my 4 year old is craving time in the water because he is on the verge of learning to swim.  I just know that if we went everyday, he would be swimming in no time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned going once per week.  Perhaps if the lessons feel very stressful, you could just aim to swim together almost every day for a couple weeks, and observe for yourself the shift that occurs in your son.  He really may not be comfortable enough yet to put his face in the water and blow bubbles.  He may need more time in water to get to a place of comfort with experimenting.  The more time a child spends in water, the more comfortable he gets experimenting with his body and arms and legs and breathing and holding breath.  It really is a big learning curve at first.  It&#39;s fun to see the great strides kids can make with it and how excited they get!  But I believe the key is not instruction for most kids.  It&#39;s just time- the more hours the body has, the better!  <br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly,<br/>\nAli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Swimming lessons","postDate":"1375154519","msgId":71793,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt0N2Jnbis1NzZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGt0NnMyaituMHF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71792,"nextInTopic":71794,"prevInTime":71792,"nextInTime":71794,"topicId":71792,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... teaching style which is unlikely to change.

He chose not to go until this year.  He&#39;s now ten.  He wanted to learn to dive.  At the last evaluation he was told he was the best diver in his class.  His swimming is a bit awkward, but improving.  He clearly prefers the diving, but is happy with his progress in swimming now too.  Actually, a couple of weeks ago he told me he really liked the instructions the teacher offered.  In between early lessons and now, we swam at the lake close to home.
