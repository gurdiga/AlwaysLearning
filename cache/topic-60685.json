I need to look at other things. I need to find something to move forward to instead of whirling and twirling around the angsty thing. Make the angry thing small and insignificant, turn away from it, look for bright and shiny things to distract you, look at tiny things that give you pleasure, look at large things that you didn&#39;t appreciate fully the first time around. Turning toward joy will definitely make it harder to feel stymied in the negative.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, if you&#39;re struggling to find a positive way to look at the going-for-a-walk situation with your son, it would help to step away from the topic completely for a day or week or month. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t take our dogs for walks, but we do find other ways to exercise them. One loves to play hide-n-seek with our son -- he will hide, she (the dog) and I will be behind closed doors elsewhere in the house, my son will holler &quot;ready!&quot;, I&#39;ll open the door to wherever the dog and I are and she&#39;ll take off searching for him. It&#39;s a physical workout for her, but a mental one too -- when we&#39;re done playing, she&#39;s wiped out! The other dog likes to retrieve a ball, so we can make that happen in the house (yes! I throw balls in the house, and sometimes I knock things over!) or we can make that happen in the backyard. If you have a treadmill or can easily obtain one, your dog can get exercise on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does help to think outside the box of &quot;how can ___ goal be achieved?&quot;. I&#39;ve walked our dogs in the neighborhood from time to time, but it&#39;s stressful for me for various reasons, not enjoyable at all, so I&#39;ve found other ways to get them exercise that is fun for them and me. Every so often my guys and I will load up the dogs and take them down to the river for a walk, and we enjoy it when we do it (well, it&#39;s still *a little* stressful for me!), but it&#39;s not an expectation. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I had an expectation of myself that I would walk the dogs in the neighborhood daily, that took the fun right out of it. Maybe that&#39;s how it feels for your son; if you take away the expectation, then those times when he chooses to go with you, that will be a treat!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: refusal","postDate":"1303234912","msgId":60726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlva2hoMCs0ams2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvaWplbitlaWg0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60716,"nextInTopic":60750,"prevInTime":60725,"nextInTime":60727,"topicId":60685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... *************** If you can see from his perspective, you aren t asking for so little - you re asking something every single day, maybe more than one time","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-729354991\">&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;lisa@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am stuck in both negativity, and thinking that Joe should do what I want him to do - especially when it&#39;s good for him and especially since I ask him for so little. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can see from his perspective, you aren&#39;t asking for &quot;so little&quot; - you&#39;re asking something every single day, maybe more than one time a day.

When my children were littler I envisioned the thousands of hikes we would take as they got older...in the snow, in the sun, in the rain, in the beauty.  But the reality is they don&#39;t want to go on walks very often. Yesterday, my oldest wanted to take a hike with our dog. That is the first time in about 1.5 months. And before that, maybe longer. I let my kids tell me when they want to walk, because then I know that their interest is there and I am not pushing them into something just because I want to do it. I ask them on occasion, to throw the idea out, but I don&#39;t require it, and can easily accept no if they don&#39;t want to go. It took me a long time to feel comfortable with the idea that I didn&#39;t need to constantly ask them to accompany me on walks several times a week.

I thought about it and realized that there are probably <br/>\nLOTS of teenage daughters who would tell their mom &quot;no way&quot; to a doctor&#39;s appt <br/>\nand the mom, I was imagining myself here, would need to suck it up and call and <br/>\ncancel AGAIN.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a pleasant thought at all, but there are lots and lots of parents who <br/>\ndo deal with this all the time.

The times for <br/>\nforcing a child to do something they really don&#39;t want to do should be rare and <br/>\nused for something very important.  My daughter got herself up and went to the <br/>\ndoctor&#39;s appointment because I insisted that we go and not reschedule.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nreally give her a choice, but she could have chosen to ignore that.  It was a <br/>\npleasant visit and a pleasant drive to and from and we listened to music and <br/>\ntalked about pleasant things even though she really really didn&#39;t want to get up <br/>\nand go at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a little reminder that if your child loses too much when she&#39;s little, when <br/>\nshe&#39;s bigger she may choose not to lose anymore, but since that&#39;s the dynamic <br/>\nshe&#39;s grown up with, someone else will.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: refusal","postDate":"1303094808","msgId":60696,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA3NkU2MTU2LTczQkEtNEFEMC1BQjQ2LTlDN0FDQ0M5RUY5RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvZzYyZys1NXV1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvZzYyZys1NXV1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60695,"nextInTopic":60698,"prevInTime":60695,"nextInTime":60697,"topicId":60685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Today I wanted to actually walk at speed without having to stop and check on him like I feel I need to when he s not with me.-=- I think maybe you could","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-553256016\">-=- Today I wanted to actually walk at speed without having to stop and check on him like I feel I need to when he&#39;s not with me.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think maybe you could use the walks to practice breathing and calming yourself.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/breathing\">http://sandradodd.com/breathing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds a little like you want there to be a rule that he does what you want.

You negotiated with him until he told you what you wanted to hear. Would you have let him get by with NOT agreeing to walk with you for a shorter period of time? He is an 8 year old. Eight year olds are still pretty self-centered. It is pretty common for kids (and adults) to not be able think about what other people want or need. I wonder if your son feels the same way that you do. I wonder if he feels like all you care about is walking the dog. When you want to walk the dog, what he says is not important. His desire to stay home is just as big as your desire to go for your walk. He won&#39;t be 8 forever. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I truly feel like Joe I have been round and round this issue and the only thing that&#39;s going to work for him (staying home) is the thing that won&#39;t work for me&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He is a kid. Why are you expecting him to understand what you need when you can&#39;t understand what he needs? It sounds like you have reached an impasse where you have made up your mind that you are not going to give in. Why are you expecting your son to give in when you can&#39;t/won&#39;t?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and I don&#39;t understand why he can&#39;t just acknowledge how lucky he is to do whatever he wants all day every day and ocassionally do what I ask him to do and be happy about it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why can&#39;t you acknowledge that he is an 8 year old boy that doesn&#39;t like to go for walks with his mother? Why can&#39;t you just walk at a different time and be happy about it? You don&#39;t have to answer those questions. I am turning your questions around and trying to help you see things from your son&#39;s perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things about being able to realize how lucky you are is that it requires knowing about the alternatives. If your son has always been unschooled, then he may not think of himself as lucky. It is just the way he lives. One of the reasons that we live the way we do is so that my kids don&#39;t have to know about the alternatives first hand. Without knowing about those alternatives, there is no reason for a kid to think of him/herself as lucky. The only time my kids express gratitude about our lifestyle is when we are out and about and they see other parents being mean to their kids. My oldest will say, &quot;Man, I am so glad that you are not like that mom.&quot; I don&#39;t want to deliberately expose my kids to jerks in order for them to think of themselves as lucky. I would rather them NOT realize that they are lucky because none of us enjoy seeing other people boss their kids around.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] refusal","postDate":"1303093803","msgId":60690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzRjFBMDMxLTk1OUEtNDhBMS1BNkZELTQ2RkJGNkM5NkM0NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlvZzFxdis0bDFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlvZzFxdis0bDFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60689,"nextInTopic":60693,"prevInTime":60689,"nextInTime":60691,"topicId":60685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-In my mind (and I don t know for sure if this is true) the majority of the people on this list would say that if I had to make a choice between forcing my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1098670018\">-=-In my mind (and I don&#39;t know for sure if this is true) the majority of the people on this list would say that if I had to make a choice between forcing my son to walk the dog or something else, I should choose the something else. <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Is that true?

I am mad that I bust my butt all day every day to get Joe what he wants and he won&#39;t take 40 minutes and walk the dog happily with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the ONLY thing I will ask him to do today.  Other than this, he eats what he wants, watches what he wants, and does what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks, Lisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60775,"nextTopicId":60741}}
