He&#39;s getting really good at identifying ducks,<br/>\nsomething I struggle with. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just sit there on the bank with our coffee and hot chocolate and<br/>\nwatch<br/>\nall the life of the river.

He also wants<br/>\nto<br/>\nlook over the proposal by the EPA for cleanup along the river, he&#39;s<br/>\nworried what they do will bother the beavers who are working so hard to<br/>\nbuild there along the east bank.  He&#39;s asked me to take him to see the<br/>\nFish and Wildlife biologist so he can ask questions.   He wants to go to<br/>\nthe public meeting here about the proposal.

We got<br/>\nto see her early successful attempts at flight into the lilac bush and<br/>\nwe<br/>\nwatched her come and go from the feeders.
