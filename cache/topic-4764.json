Maybe you could<br/>\nstart checking out the local newspaper, the daily or the wekly freebies,<br/>\nand just see what&#39;s up right now. Or you could check with the state or<br/>\nregional parks district and see what they&#39;re up to, or the local museums,<br/>\nor the tv guide,  and just see what sounds cool to at least one of you.<br/>\nThen you can call around and make plans, maybe aim for one thing a week?<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
