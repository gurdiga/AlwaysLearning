My 17 yo son was a rager.  When he <br/>\nwas about 5 yo I pulled him and his sister from school and started <br/>\nacademically unschooling.  When he was 6 his rages started really <br/>\nscaring me.  Was my son going to be a psychopath when he got <br/>\nolder?!?!?  My gut was so twisted up that I felt SUCH a sense of <br/>\nurgency and that&#39;s when I dove into radical unschooling (and I am <br/>\nFOREVER thankful for Sandra Dodd and the other posters at <br/>\nunschooling.com!!)  And I certainly won&#39;t say that it was easy.  I <br/>\nread the boards every day.  I had to be EVER watchful of my own <br/>\ninternal struggle.  He could push my buttons, boy howdy!  And as Pam <br/>\nsaid, I had to put on my Mommy hat (or as I like to ask &quot;who&#39;s the <br/>\nadult here?&quot;) It was up to ME to be able to let it go.  TO be the <br/>\nemotional sink.  The lightning rod.  The example.  <br/>\nI got in the habit of picturing him as he was when he was a newborn.  <br/>\nWhen he was 2.  When he was 3.  Because I bet your son is a lot like <br/>\nmine and really SWEET.  I had to keep that image in mind and <br/>\ncommunicate with my sweet boy.  <br/>\nI had to touch him a LOT.  Not when he was angry but in all the <br/>\nlittle moments throughout the day.  And not with some agenda like: &quot;I <br/>\nam now going to touch you so that you will not be such a pain&quot;, but <br/>\ntotally with the same love that I felt when he was 1 and 2 years <br/>\nold.  That helped SO much.  When I wanted to argue with him I had to <br/>\nSTOP.  And just listen more.  And really TRY and understand.<br/>\nI&#39;ve spoken with my husband and he was able to explain to me that <br/>\nanger for him is like a switch.  It&#39;s either on or off.  It&#39;s a hard <br/>\nconcept for me to understand, but I guess Connor&#39;s is like that too.  <br/>\nBut they DO learn to manage that switch.  Really.  When COnnor was <br/>\nlittle everything was black and white.  He now understands that there <br/>\nis gray.<br/>\nAnother thing I learned was to know when something was negotiable or <br/>\nnot.  If it wasn&#39;t negotiable it wasn&#39;t kind to argue on and on about <br/>\nit.  To let him invest energy in the argument was leading him on.  <br/>\nI&#39;m a talker and didn&#39;t want to be overbearing etc.  But when the <br/>\nanswer is going to HAVE to be a certain way, then it is what it is.<br/>\nI had to analyze everthing to see if I was being arbitrary though.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing how many things parents can think to say no to or make a <br/>\nbig deal about when there&#39;s no REAL reason.

I remember reading a book once called<br/>\n&quot;Benign Neglect&quot; and it was talked a lot about in AP circles when my 13 yr<br/>\nold was little. I didn&#39;t warm to it, mostly because I felt the 2 words<br/>\ntogether were an oxymoron--and anything having to do with Neglect reminded<br/>\nme of the Ferber method and all of that mindset in parenting that I do not<br/>\nlike.

TO let them let it OUT, (of course not ON someone, or have it affect<br/>\nothers), but in their own space and time. I have found that to work. I used<br/>\nto follow my oldest to his room when he was angry, I was angry that he was<br/>\nexpressing his anger by slamming doors and screaming, and I would scream<br/>\nback that it was unacceptable. ??????????????

That&#39;s not working, is it? You&#39;re all &quot;at  <br/>\nyour wits end,&quot; as you said.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - for now - accept the way things are. Accept him as he is. Accept  <br/>\nthat he is, for the moment, kind of unpredictably quick-on-the-trigger  <br/>\nand he needs your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that you KNOW this about him, you know that, for a while, you have  <br/>\nto let other things drop and be far far far more present with him. It  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be forever, but he needs you now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate an environment for him in which he can be successful. Start  <br/>\nfrom where he IS right now, not from where you wish he could be or  <br/>\nfrom where some hypothetical 6 year old is supposed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t set him up for failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nPutting him in the bathtub with his sister is a set-up. Too close, too  <br/>\neasy to hurt, annoy, splash, bump, each other. Not a good choice for  <br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for ways they can be together but separate. Don&#39;t expect them to  <br/>\nshare space easily, for now. If you&#39;re setting up something for them  <br/>\nto do, set up separate sets of materials or parts or whatever it is,  <br/>\nfor them in separate spaces. I used to use a chair for each kid as  <br/>\ntheir own little table -- they&#39;d sit on the floor in front of a chair,  <br/>\nusing the chair seat (and sometimes the floor around the chair) as  <br/>\ntheir table. The chairs could be set apart from each other enough so  <br/>\nthat the kids weren&#39;t accidentally bumping. That helped them avoid the  <br/>\nfrustration of a sibling reaching for something and bumping their  <br/>\nstuff or picking up something they were wanting to use, etc. It gave  <br/>\nthem the security of not worrying about what the sibling was about to  <br/>\ndo. THAT relieved a great deal of tension and they could happily color  <br/>\nor play with playdough or do puzzles or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t expect your son to easily share space with other kids, for right  <br/>\nnow. Always have that awareness in your head - always be asking  <br/>\nyourself, &quot;Hmm, if we do this, how can I set it up for him to be  <br/>\nsuccessful?&quot; There are activities in which you will not participate,  <br/>\nfor now.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, don&#39;t take him to group activities that will involve him  <br/>\nrunning off with other kids without you being able to stay nearby.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s a set-up. You have to be able to be nearby so that you can step  <br/>\nin WAY earlier than you have been. You&#39;re frustrated because by the  <br/>\ntime you step in to help, it is too late and he&#39;s already in a  <br/>\ncomplete rage. You have to be there and be super observant.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind ways for him to do things with a friend - play on a nice big  <br/>\nplayground where you can be right at hand, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch carefully for signs of frustration and step in with distraction  <br/>\nor support as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the habit of running through upcoming activities in your mind,  <br/>\nthinking of him and how the interactions are going to be. In the car -  <br/>\ndoes he have enough space? Can he see out? Does he have something to  <br/>\ndo so he looks forward to getting into the car? Do you play music and  <br/>\nsing along?

When anyone is really frustrated and angry, being a bystander is a very difficult place to be. My best","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-345486925\">Kim,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry you are going thru this with your son.  When anyone is really frustrated and angry, being a bystander is a very difficult place to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best friend has a son who is identical to how you are describing your son.  Her son was born with a certain temperment, as all children are, and it just seemed to develop into a pattern of frustration and anger as he grew older.  His parents were super laid back when they birthed him, but I have to say as time has gone by (he is 9) that they seem to be more mirroring their son&#39;s behavior.  Why?  Because it IS so difficult and exasperating to deal with.  I have watched my friend over the years try so many things.....diet, waldorf school, homeschool, unschool, back to school again.....and all the things in between.  I don&#39;t think anything changed what his behavior is basically.  But, I do think that the listening to him--allowing him to talk or shout out his frustrations in the safety of their home, with the love of his parents-not the judgement, has helped.  Diane has had to be at his side at all times when they are on outings, she makes sure he eats regularly and has a lot of protein, enough sleep, enough touch and love.  But, even when ALL those things are accounted for, I will say that he still has &quot;issues&quot;.  Though I love and adore him, I also find it exhausting after a few days in a row of having to deal with it, of having to anticipate it, and look for it, try to mitigate it ahead of time---because I think this is what my friend has to do.  And by doing all of that, I do think SHE feels better about the times when he IS still frustrated and angry, because she cannot blame it on a lack of food, protein, sleep etc.  She knows that it is truly from within him and then she can just focus on that.  And &quot;that&quot; is still unclear.  She really cannot figure out the WHY or the perhaps real issue behind it all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would be careful about being too controlling with regard to everything.....I notice that she and her hubby have been SO proactive, that it has crossed the line to too much CONTROL, which will probably cause more of what they are trying to sooth!!  I remember reading a book once called &quot;Benign Neglect&quot; and it was talked a lot about in AP circles when my 13 yr old was little.  I didn&#39;t warm to it, mostly because I felt the 2 words together were an oxymoron--and anything having to do with Neglect reminded me of the Ferber method and all of that mindset in parenting that I do not like.  BUT---over the years what I have taken from it is WHEN it is possible to kind of ALLOW some raw behavior and anger and frustration---to just allow it.  TO let them let it OUT, (of course not ON someone, or have it affect others), but in their own space and time.  I have found that to work.  I used to follow my oldest to his room when he was angry, I was angry that he was expressing his anger by slamming doors and screaming, and I would scream back that it was unacceptable.  ??????????????  Yes, I have learned much better parenting skills!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, my point is that some people just are angry....simmering inside for some reason.  Could it be chemicle?  Of course.  Could it be any number of reasons?  Yes.  But the fact remains, they have this inner volcano that needs to let off steam.  My father has always been this way, and he took his anger and channeled it into athletics........big time.  Then as a professor, he needed an outlet and became a police officer in his &quot;spare time&quot;.  Whatever.  I am pointing out that something might help.  Karate--swimming, running, archery, fencing, wrestling..........something that really takes a lot of inner steam OUT.  For my friend&#39;s son, anytime he can swim or be in water it is the most helpful.  It&#39;s not so helpful that they live in Arizona though! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Sandra about letting him know the reprecussions for his behavior, but just as most kids cannot relate to the question &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up,&quot; they cannot relate to &quot;if you were an adult, this behavior would....&quot;  They are NOT adults.  They aren&#39;t even close at 6!<br/>\n<br/>\nFind someone you can share your frustrations with.  My friend needs to be so aware and present all the time, that it exhausts her spiritually, and she needs to unload and refuel.  That&#39;s what friends are for.  (with red wine and chocolate!)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo NOT forget to refuel.  You will be your best for him if you are at your best.  And with another child at home, you are ever present and on demand!  It is truly an integral part of the big picture.  And the benign neglect?  Let some things go, and pick your battles.  If you focus on everything, then it ends up nothing is really being focused on--<br/>\n<br/>\nSending you some energy!<br/>\nKelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/\">http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Childhood is a journey, not a race.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Angry Son, Frustrated Mommy","postDate":"1212672347","msgId":35249,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcyOHBncis0NjVnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDliY2E5ZTMwODA2MDQxOTMweTdhMzZjMjFidTMwZmRiM2I0YzdlYWQxYWNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":35247,"nextInTopic":35254,"prevInTime":35248,"nextInTime":35250,"topicId":35238,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... everything. ...

Even he would say, &quot;I don&#39;t know why I did that!&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t want to do it!&quot;  I eventually took him to a holistic doctor who, through applied kinesiology (or muscle testing), diagnosed him with quite an array of food sensitivities.  After the foods that were causing issues were removed, his behaviors changed dramatically.  I would say his entire sensory system was a bit out of whack from foods (dairy, wheat, corn, etc).  Prior to eliminating the foods, he was afraid to slide or be lifted high into the air.  His balance system was not functioning effectively.  That changed as well after eliminating certain foods.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be a challenging change in terms of family diets as well as costs, but for us, discovering food sensitivities was profound.  I later used a place called the &quot;Great Plains Lab&quot; which utilizes a blood test to look at more subtle responses to foods (most traditional doctors consider allergies to be histamine response, NOT subtle sensitivities, and their tests generally, from my experience and reading, do NOT test for the subtleties which can underlie many things including behaviors).

He<br/>\ntends to get easily frustrated when things don&#39;t go his way, or when life<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t happen the way he&#39;s decided it should happen.  I&#39;ve been trying very<br/>\nhard to help him.  But some days, I feel like a horrible parent!  We&#39;ve had<br/>\n2 incidents in the past 2 days that have left DS and I in tears, DD(4)<br/>\nscared from all the screaming, and DH ready to start spanking.  It&#39;s<br/>\nbecoming so frequent and so intense that I don&#39;t really have much patience<br/>\nany more to even deal with the small issues.  We are at our wits end.  You<br/>\nguys have been very helpful in the past, and I&#39;d really love your advice<br/>\nnow, if you have any.<br/>\n<br/>\nYESTERDAY:<br/>\nDS and DD were in the tub.  She was throwing a washcloth at him, and he was<br/>\nsplashing her.  When I walked in, she was screaming, &quot;Stop that!&quot; at the top<br/>\nof her lungs.  Who knows who started what.  No big deal--simple sibling<br/>\nargument.  However, when I try to intervene, that&#39;s when it escalates into a<br/>\nhuge screaming match.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went in to find out what the problem was.  I let each kid tell their own<br/>\nversion of the story.  I asked them how they felt about what the other one<br/>\nwas doing, and asked them if there was anything they could think of that<br/>\nwould work better than screaming or splashing.  DD participated, and was<br/>\nhappy for the intervention and help.  DS hated it.  I don&#39;t know what to do<br/>\nin these situations.  Normally, if he doesn&#39;t want my help, I back off, and<br/>\nlet him figure things out on his own.  But he cannot be allowed to<br/>\ndisrespect DD&#39;s boundries. When he&#39;s poking, splashing, hitting, whacking,<br/>\nsitting on, kicking, or biting her, I do intervene.  In this example, I<br/>\nended up sending him to his room because he would not stop picking on her.<br/>\nI know there&#39;s a better way to handle this, but I&#39;m not sure what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHis is a huge issue we&#39;ve been discussing as a family lately (respecting<br/>\nother people&#39;s boundries).  DS will be told to stop doing all kinds of<br/>\nthings that bother DD, DH or I, and he will not stop.  He looks at you and<br/>\nkeeps doing it.  Sometimes he laughs and keeps doing it.    DH and I now<br/>\nstep in and make him stop, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be helping in the long<br/>\nrun.<br/>\n<br/>\nTODAY:<br/>\nWe were all out hiking with a bunch of kids.  It was a 3-mile hike, and all<br/>\nthe kids were running ahead.  As we approached the parking lot, I saw<br/>\nanother mom holding DS&#39;s hand, and DS was hitting her with a stick!  I ran<br/>\nup and the mom said that DS was throwing rocks and sticks at a group of<br/>\nhikers and their dog.  I was mortified!   I immediately dragged DS to the<br/>\ncar.  He was biting, pinching and hitting me the whole way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt turns out that he had tripped over the dog, and the owner tried to help<br/>\nhim up.  He got mad at her for interfering with him &quot;winning&quot; the race to<br/>\nthe &quot;finish line&quot; (the end of the trail).  So he started throwing rocks and<br/>\nsticks at the dog and the woman.  The other mother pulled DS away from them<br/>\nand that&#39;s when he started hitting her with a stick.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat on earth do you do in this situation?  DS was completely out of<br/>\ncontrol.  He was not able to listen, to be calmed down or anything.  He<br/>\nrefused to get in the car and attempted to run away when I was not holding<br/>\nhim.  I understand that it&#39;s impossible to talk to him in the moment.  But<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t want to talk about it out of the moment either.  When we try to<br/>\ntalk about other ways to deal with his anger, he says he doesn&#39;t want to do<br/>\nanything else.  He &quot;likes yelling and screaming and arguing.&quot;  (He does<br/>\nadmit to not liking hurting other people.)  We tell him he is not allowed to<br/>\nhurt other people like that.  We ask him if he would like us to remind him<br/>\nof another way to deal with his anger in the moment.  Sometimes he says,<br/>\n&quot;No,&quot; and we don&#39;t remind him and it turns into this huge fight again.<br/>\nSometimes he says, &quot;Yes,&quot; but when we remind him in the heat of the moment,<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t care and doesn&#39;t do anything else.  He hits (or bites, or kicks),<br/>\nthen is made to stop.  THen he yells at me and then finally calms down<br/>\nsaying, &quot;I don&#39;t know what else to do!&quot; (about his anger.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help.  I was so at my wits end today in the car that I actually<br/>\nslapped him when he would not stop biting me.  I feel horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":35293,"nextTopicId":35278}}
