People are always going on about how bad it is to judge <br/>\nothers, how no one has the right to pass judgment and don&#39;t you dare judge me <br/>\nwho the hell do you think you are and so on and so forth. Which sort of makes <br/>\na mockery of our court system, our sporting events, and of course, American <br/>\nIdol. Without judges, these esteemed institutions of American culture would <br/>\ncease to function. And nobody wants that. Without judgment all manner of <br/>\ndisputes would go unresolved, athletics would fail to deliver a winner, and <br/>\nwe&#39;d have no President. Judgment ain&#39;t a bad thing in and of itself. Until, <br/>\nof course, someone judges me, and I&#39;ll be all like, &quot;What, you judging me? <br/>\nDon&#39;t you dare judge me.
