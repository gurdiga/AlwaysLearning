I&#39;m sure you know<br/>\nthis already, but I wanted to be sure -- It is not a replacement for a<br/>\nregular controller, and can only be used with the games designed<br/>\nspecifically for the eye toy. Right now, the only games available are<br/>\nthe 12 that come with it, but there are others on the way according to<br/>\neyetoy.com -- I think they are ideal for the child who would like to<br/>\nplay video games, but may have fine motor difficulties.
