This stood out to me, and I&#39;m trying to figure out why.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first read it, I felt a bit defensive, as if you were saying that the reason my son feels panicked when people talk to him is because I am not providing physical and emotional safety for him and expecting him to change and become outgoing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think he feels panicked because it&#39;s his personality to not like people getting too close and talking to him or touching him.  And my husband and/or I have always been with him, and never tried to make him be more outgoing.  We answer for him when people talk to him, don&#39;t force him into situations with others without us, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me that your words stood out to me because that idea is JUST what is bothering me right now....I think the same as you, that if I&#39;m providing safety, then he would have no reason to panic.  So when my son gets panicked, I reassure him.  I support him.  I pat his back as he hides his face in my body.  And as he continues to panic, I feel like, &quot;Hey!  I&#39;m right here!  You&#39;re safe!  I&#39;m protecting you.  No reason to panic!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son gets shy and panics and I provide the safest of physical and emotional safety I can provide, and he continues to panic, it feels like he&#39;s telling me (because of my belief as above) that I&#39;m not providing enough physical and emotional safety for him.  THAT, I think now, is what may be bothering me the most.  It&#39;s not that I want him to become outgoing before he&#39;s ready.  It&#39;s that I want him to be more comforted by my support than he is.  It&#39;s that I want him to respond to my support with calm and comfort so that I can feel like I&#39;m adequately providing support.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t like the idea that I can&#39;t provide exactly as much support as my son needs in any given moment.  :(<br/>\n<br/>\nBut.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hoping it&#39;s my THINKING about this that&#39;s really the issue.  If some other mindful parents have children who panic when others talk to them even with the support of their unschooling parents, then maybe my problem is that I&#39;m expecting to be able to &quot;support&quot; him into &quot;not having a reason to panic&quot;.  Maybe there ARE some children who are so very bothered by the attention of unfamiliar people that enough support cannot be provided to help them feel calm?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is more I can do, I really, really want to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s my thinking that&#39;s the issue, I really, really want to think about it differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helped alot to hear that there are some others here who have similar children who have gotten older and become more comfortable on their own.

She&#39;s not as interested in yoga or martial arts classes, even when she likes the teachers better, because the subject material doesn&#39;t excite her as much - but I know other kids who are far more interested in those kinds of classes for the social outlet than the content. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; My husband has been working lots of overtime, so there are 15 hour days where I am inside.

So if your child is a &quot;watcher&quot; in that sense, the best thing you can do is set him or her up to observe social situations without interacting. That&#39;s been fantasitically helpful for Mo - and fo me, too! I realized that I prefer to watch before jumping in, but because I was never allowed to do that as a child I had to sort of give myself permission to Look at people and observe them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMo needs more than just time to watch, she needs to sort of aclimate, and to do that it helps a lot for her to have a tool. When she was younger a portable DVD player helped a lot, and now the laptop or a portable game works well for her, and sometimes a book. It means that I, as a parent, end up dealing with some strange looks - I have the kid other adults complain about, the one who won&#39;t look up from her book or electronics at the park or in the woods. Given time, she does look up and will even go and strike up conversations with complete strangers (and if you have a shy child you can probably imagine my happy dance - she Talks to People!). I let people know she needs some time and make sure no-one tries to hassle her. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; I cringe a<br/>\n&gt; little when I hear stories of how much &quot;better socialized&quot; or &quot;more<br/>\n&gt; social&quot; homeschoolers are than schooled children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I know what you mean. The thing is, Mo has much better social skills than I did at the same age, much better than shy school kids. She&#39;s just not outgoing most of the time. What she is is an impressive judge of character. She&#39;s good at knowing who to trust and when - even knowing when someone she likes is in a bad mood and needs some space. Given the chance to observe and take in the details, she picks up more subtle cues. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What did you do that helped your child feel more relaxed when people<br/>\n&gt; talked to him or her?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It depends on the situation. I&#39;ll answer for Mo in a situation where politeness is called for. As she&#39;s gotten older, she&#39;s better able to make polite social noise, but it depends on the situation a lot - in a busy, noisy space for instance she&#39;s easily overwhelmed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf an adult seems too pushy, I&#39;ll run some interference - again, answer questions For Mo, but also actively suggest Mo go somewhere or do something that takes her away from the pushy person, generally in my company, like &quot;lets go look at the ducks&quot; or &quot;shall we go get the backpack out of the car?&quot; But some adults aren&#39;t pushy - they&#39;ll see her pull back and be gracious about it, let her know its okay if she doesn&#39;t talk to them. Those are the people she&#39;s more likely to talk with later ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Around what age did your child become more<br/>\n&gt; relaxed about it, if ever? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mo&#39;s going to be 10 in August, and she&#39;s gotten significantly more social in the last two years. She&#39;s still Not very outgoing! But she&#39;s started striking up conversations with adults - not all adults, but when she does she&#39;s very charming and personable. She also wants to be more social now - for awhile if we had company or had an outting, she&#39;d need several days to recover, even if she had a great time. Now she&#39;s ready to be out and about more and we&#39;re shifting gears, trying to make that happen as much as she&#39;d like. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What did you do that helped them foster<br/>\n&gt; relationships with others?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mo has friends who are adults as well as some who are children. With kid-friends it has been important to make sure she doesn&#39;t &quot;burn out&quot; on too much sociability - especially with one particular friend who is veeerrrry outgoing! That&#39;s brought up different issues because I haven&#39;t wanted the other girl&#39;s feelings to be hurt - fortunately she&#39;s very talkative so we&#39;ve been able to talk about introverts and extraverts and why Mo needs to go hide now and then. With her adult friends, the main thing has been to honor those friendships as friendships - not ever set the adult up as a babysitter or &quot;in charge&quot;. Her adult friends come and play as friends, which means there&#39;s a parent on hand to deal with any issues that may come up, same as if the friend were another child. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240358028,"authorName":"kristi_beguin","from":"&quot;kristi_beguin&quot; &lt;foehn_jye@...&gt;","profile":"kristi_beguin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Shy Young Children","postDate":"1306525305","msgId":61297,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlyb3VwcCt0bTRsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlyb3BvcCthM2ViQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61294,"nextInTopic":61298,"prevInTime":61296,"nextInTime":61298,"topicId":61293,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You might want to ask him if he&#39;d like for you to answer for him when you are out and about and might run into people.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, who is a couple weeks away from turning 9, rarely talks to people she doesn&#39;t know or rarely sees. Sometimes she won&#39;t talk to people she knows well if we haven&#39;t seen them for a while, or if the circumstances are uncomfortable for her. I&#39;ve noticed that while sometimes people pose a question directly to a child, they often don&#39;t care much who answers, especially in casual situations, like running into someone at the store.  They might say, &quot;How are you today?&quot; while looking at my daughter, but I can easily and happily answer, &quot;We are great, thanks!&quot; If they ask a direct question to my daughter, and I see that she is uncomfortable speaking, I&#39;ll answer for her, or ask her if she&#39;s like me to answer for her if it&#39;s likely that won&#39;t cause embarrassment.

In my experience, the best thing for us has been for me to not get emotionally worked up over her lack of interest in talking.  If I am calm and happy, and don&#39;t feel stressed or worried about her actions, she can sense that. There is no added pressure for her when I am happy about who she is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past several years I&#39;ve observed that she will speak to all sorts of people she doesn&#39;t know, depending upon the situation.

No one could hold her or even talk to her (probably birth to about  4) without her crying. I was a little surprised for a while about her reaction because her older sister wasn&#39;t like that at all. We always kept an extra close eye on her because she would have gladly gone off with anyone. But anytime someone would say something to my youngest, I would just hug her a little bit more to let her know that I was right with her and not going anywhere. One day (I think she was about 4) she said to me &quot; you know how you watch us do gymnastics and stuff, well that is what I do with other people. I just like to watch to see what they are doing&quot;. She was perfectly happy observing, even though I sometimes worried that she was feeling left out. One day my neighbor called and said that my daughter was at her house playing and talking to everyone. I don&#39;t think my neighbor thought she ever talked.<br/>\nNow my daughter is 6 and talks to everyone she knows. Lots of people can hardly believe she&#39;s the same little girl that wouldn&#39;t even look at anyone when they spoke to her. I think because I let her be who she naturally was. She&#39;s still shy in new situations and around people she has never met. But she&#39;s now more comfortable around people than my oldest is. She literally laughs and talks nonstop to the same people that she was so painfully shy around.<br/>\nIt&#39;s obvious to others when someone is shy, so I just didn&#39;t make a big deal about it. If I say hi to a child that is shy and they don&#39;t respond I don&#39;t expect anything from the parent. I just smile and then leave the child alone because I know that is what my daughter wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;maryann&quot; &lt;maryannh@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Jenny Cyphers, Thank you so much for sharing this story of your<br/>\n&gt; daughter. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/61261\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/61261</a><br/>\n&gt; I would LOVE to hear more stories of children who didn&#39;t talk much to<br/>\n&gt; people outside their immediate family when they were young.
