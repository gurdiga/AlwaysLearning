He just likes to save money and buy them because if he has the money we may not need to wait until we have some.

Holly knows it better than others.  We&#39;ve done Canadian provinces right up above (where they are, even though they&#39;re not marked, I think--the map&#39;s downstairs and Holly&#39;s busy).  Each of my kids has been to a state the other two haven&#39;t, which I think is VERY, very cool.  When I was their age my entire map (marking just what I remembered, not infancy) would&#39;ve been New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona and California, and the latter two came when I was 17 years old.    But that&#39;s what we&#39;ve used colored stars for, and it&#39;s not gold for better-than-silver, it&#39; one color per kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170380942,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;lisa@...&gt;","profile":"cslisacs","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Jack wants a star chart","postDate":"1314499765","msgId":62534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGozY2FibCtpdnRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDZBN0ZBNDVGLTUwNjEtNEFBOS04RUU1LUExQjBBN0ZGMjkwOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62529,"nextInTopic":62536,"prevInTime":62533,"nextInTime":62535,"topicId":62528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I would do categories of whatever he s interested in - like if it were my son I would have a star for played minecraft for 8 hours in one day or ate 2","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-391311273\">I would do categories of whatever he&#39;s interested in - like if it were my son I would have a star for &quot;played minecraft for 8 hours in one day&quot; or &quot;ate 2 apples in one day&quot; or &quot;did somersaults on the trampoline for 10 minutes&quot;  or &quot;watched 3 youtube videos in a row&quot; - you know, something he&#39;s likely to do anyway, but just note it with a star.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Colleen","from":"&quot;Colleen&quot; &lt;3potatoes@...&gt;","profile":"trespotatoes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Jack wants a star chart","postDate":"1314498601","msgId":62536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGozYzk3OStmM21zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGozYm9ncitkdTMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62534,"nextInTopic":62537,"prevInTime":62535,"nextInTime":62537,"topicId":62528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son often asked me to help him make star-type charts when he was 5 and 6 (he s 8 now).
