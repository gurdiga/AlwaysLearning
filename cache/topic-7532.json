For those<br/>\nnot in Va., SOL&#39;s are Standards of Learning tests.  They&#39;re a bunch of<br/>\ngarbage that the state has put into effect to see how well the schools<br/>\nare doing their job.  Kids will have to pass them to graduate by the<br/>\ntime they finish implementing the program in a few years.  Teachers hate<br/>\nthem because they take all the creativity out of teaching and make it<br/>\nformulaic in order to get the kids to pass the stupid test.  All four of<br/>\nmy kids sat down for the 10 question SOL mini-test.  I was curious how<br/>\nthey would do, since we&#39;ve been purely unschooling since they left<br/>\nschool a year and a half ago.  It was very high tech - you could see<br/>\nafter each question what your score was and where you stood in the group<br/>\non a big screen.  You took the test on little electronic machines.  My<br/>\noldest son (12) stayed in 2nd place out of 10 kids through most of the<br/>\nquestions and ended up 3rd in the end.  My older daughter and younger<br/>\nson (10 & 9) finished up in 6th and 7th I think, and my youngest<br/>\ndaughter (7), was in last place.  I was very pleased that all but the<br/>\nyoungest, who would be too young for these tests anyway if she were a ps<br/>\nstudent held their own, and my oldest did quite well.  And they&#39;ve kept<br/>\nup without putting up with all that school garbage!<br/>\n <br/>\nAt the fair there was a really cute craft at the kids crafts booth.  You<br/>\ntake a hosiery knee-high, rye grass seed, sawdust, rubber bands, googly<br/>\neyes and a marker.  You pour a small cup (dixie cup) of rye seed into<br/>\nthe knee high, then a larger cup of sawdust.  Using a dixie cup with the<br/>\nbottom cut out for a funnel with a wide bottom will make the pouring<br/>\neasy.  Tie a knot in the knee-high, and cut the excess off.  Pinch a<br/>\nbubble of the sawdust filled knee-high into a nose and secure with a<br/>\nrubber band.  Glue on googly eyes and draw a mouth.  Soak the little guy<br/>\nin water for a few minutes, then lay in a plate with a little water in<br/>\nindirect light.  Water every day and watch the grass grow into hair.<br/>\nVoila, a homemade chia pet!  My youngest accidentally did it upside down<br/>\nat the fair, so hers will be bald with a beard!
