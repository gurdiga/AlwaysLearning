Passionate<br/>\ninterest.&quot;-------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I see play out before me every day. Living with my daughter Noor, I&#39;ve come to completely disagree with the author&#39;s conclusion that:<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~&quot;But what that education is  what enables creativity  is often quite different from what people imagine. It requires more training and discipline, not less. In other words: being socialized into a culture of practice&quot;~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a huge assumption--first that education actually *enables* creativity, and is it the only thing that does? I think she&#39;s saying that it is and second, that one needs to be socialized (trained) to do that which one&#39;s art requires (practice).<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery day I see the opposite of this play out in my home.  My 7yr daughter is an artist. She spends hours a day drawing, recently on a computer, learning how to use very complex graphic programs: hours on one drawing, layer after layer of more detail, retracing and modifying previous lines, shading, backgrounds, texture.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe went swimming on Sunday, one of her favorite things to do, but she was ready to leave so she could get home to draw.  She tore through the door and literally ran to the desk. She had to (had to in a good way &lt;g&gt;) get the thought out (she&#39;d been sketching it in the car); her whole body missed being engaged in the (painful, tedious, disciplined) act of creating images, her mind was hyper focused. I brought her a drink and asked her a question and she looked at me and said, &quot;mom, I need you to leave me alone.  I haven&#39;t drawn all day and I need to concentrate.  Do we have any strawberries?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I made her practice her drawing--well it would be a whole other flavor of pie, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\nEverywhere we go, Noor sees lines, shadows, light, texture, color, emotion......she is isn&#39;t sitting and being trained to see like an artist--she&#39;s learning all these things already because she couldn&#39;t help not to; it would go against her very nature!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the gift an unschooling life offers: the time and support to focus on what truly drives a person.  The idea that all the unpleasant, hard work involved with creating/mastering art requires &quot;training&quot; to be &quot;disciplined&quot; to &quot;practice&quot; that thing is completely false when a person freely chooses to follow her passion. Sure, the work may be hard, difficult, tedious, painful....but it is part of the process, part of the joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever really watched a child who loves to draw, draw? Or a child master one level of a difficult computer game after another?  It is painstakingly difficult work! She does it, not because she is required to, but because she LOVES to!

Who knows what our world will be like by the time our young children grow up, but what I do know is that because of unschooling my children are going to know how to think for themselves, will go after their dreams, strengths and talents. From most unschooling stories that I have read about people who now have adult children, they create their own ways of making money and don&#39;t depend on someone hiring them. I don&#39;t trust in our government or economy, but I do trust in my children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to let our economic situation worry us, but the best we can do is to learn and teach our children survival skills and basic living skills along with their self-led schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if this helps anyone else, but it is how I have been dealing with my concerns about my kids&#39; future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlba<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bea&quot; &lt;beatrice.mantovani@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m feeling a bit insecure these days, worrying about my children&#39;s future (I know I have time, they are only 5 and 2 years old) and I would like to know what people on this list think of these two articles.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The first one is about the desirability of a college degree:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/economy/89675/bad-job-market-media-wrong-college-degree?page=0,0\">http://www.tnr.com/article/economy/89675/bad-job-market-media-wrong-college-degree?page=0,0</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The second one is about the necessity of training and discipline in the arts:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://savageminds.org/2011/06/19/the-conservatory-in-creativity-or-ken-robinson-vs-black-swan/\">http://savageminds.org/2011/06/19/the-conservatory-in-creativity-or-ken-robinson-vs-black-swan/</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bea<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I would like your opinion on these two articles.","postDate":"1308623036","msgId":61669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlDOUJCQ0RGLUY1QzAtNEE4Qi05NThDLTEyMzI4RDhEN0NDM0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl0b2Y2dSt0NXZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl0b2Y2dSt0NXZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61667,"nextInTopic":61670,"prevInTime":61668,"nextInTime":61670,"topicId":61667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So, therefore, put everyone through rigorous training  <br/>\nand you&#39;ll get great artists. And scientists. And engineers. And  <br/>\nsports greats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the training that creates greatness, it&#39;s the internal need  <br/>\nto suck more and more of that in. That&#39;s something people are born with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading what makes a master at anything is 10,000 hours.  <br/>\nBut what makes someone want to put in 10,000 hours? Love. Passionate  <br/>\ninterest.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is kind of what the first is getting at. It&#39;s being assumed that  <br/>\nthe 4 years of college gets someone a better job. But it&#39;s the drive  <br/>\nto go through what was once a fairly rigorous program that indicates  <br/>\nthat someone has what it takes to perform at a job that is rigorous  <br/>\nenough to deserve a higher salary. But with so many kids going onto  <br/>\ncollege so they can get that piece of paper, it isn&#39;t the sorting  <br/>\nsystem it once was. And the piece of paper isn&#39;t meaning the same as  <br/>\nit once did.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at your kids. Feed what they&#39;re wanting to suck in. That&#39;s really  <br/>\nall that counts.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":413967925,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;beatrice.mantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"I would like your opinion on these two articles.","postDate":"1308606494","msgId":61667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGl0b2Y2dSt0NXZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":61669,"prevInTime":61666,"nextInTime":61668,"topicId":61667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I m feeling a bit insecure these days, worrying about my children s future (I know I have time, they are only 5 and 2 years old) and I would like to know","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1329865654\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling a bit insecure these days, worrying about my children&#39;s future (I know I have time, they are only 5 and 2 years old) and I would like to know what people on this list think of these two articles.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first one is about the desirability of a college degree:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/economy/89675/bad-job-market-media-wrong-college-degree?page=0,0\">http://www.tnr.com/article/economy/89675/bad-job-market-media-wrong-college-degree?page=0,0</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe second one is about the necessity of training and discipline in the arts:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://savageminds.org/2011/06/19/the-conservatory-in-creativity-or-ken-robinson-vs-black-swan/\">http://savageminds.org/2011/06/19/the-conservatory-in-creativity-or-ken-robinson-vs-black-swan/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBea</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61593,"nextTopicId":61653}}
