But, <br/>\nthough that all seems nice, that was obviously not what he needed or <br/>\nwanted!  (And, in retrospect, it was, ahem, rather grandiose of me to <br/>\nwant to be the solution to his every problem.)  He needed space to <br/>\nfeel and express his frustration, only he did not know how to tell me <br/>\nthat&#39;s what he wanted.  Once I finally got it, everything was able to <br/>\nget better.  And, the sooner I was able to get myself out of his way, <br/>\nthe less need he had to rage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, three things sustained me:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  I *decided* to feel honored to be Liam&#39;s safe place where he <br/>\ncould express the ugliest thoughts and yet know he was incredibly and <br/>\nthoroughly loved and adored,<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Where possible, I would offer constructive help (like &quot;Do you <br/>\nwant me to look that up and see if there&#39;s a way to beat that <br/>\nboss?&quot;), and if he said OK, good, but if not, I&#39;d back off, and<br/>\n<br/>\n3.

Again, in retrospect, I see <br/>\nthat we were on a path of adversity, though that was not my conscious <br/>\nchoice.  I think that by being willing to abandon my grandiose <br/>\nnotions of how I should parent, we were able to get on a better path <br/>\nthat had less to do with my ego and more to do with allowing Liam the <br/>\nspace to discover himself and who he really is on his own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

Often I feel pressed by other things, other commitments. So,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-649612651\">For me one of the hardest things when Linnaea gets frustrated and unhappy is making room for her. Often I feel pressed by other things, other commitments. So, last night, for example. I came up to bed and Linnaea was sitting on the foot of Simon&#39;s bed and David and Simon were irritated with her. And suddenly I felt burdened by everybody elses need for sleep and calm and rational as well as a need to help Linnaea negotiate through whatever she need negotiating through. The hard thing for me is being able to shunt aside those feelings and take care of her in that moment. It is important that you figure out a way to put Lukas before your friend&#39;s needs and your husband&#39;s nneeds in those moments where he needs you to be there for him, even if he is telling you to go away (you can always give him space, but try and do it generously and try not to say &quot;fine, I&#39;ll just go then&quot; in the angry, hurt voice of someone who is taking it personally). Just like Linnaea<br/>\n needs me to be there for her in those moments which often come when something else is pressing. Same for Simon, except he is usually likely to get tense when we are leaving to go and do something. Again a moment when I feel pressed by other people&#39;s needs, even when I&#39;m not.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour friend wants to fix it for you, she wants to help you feel better, she feels that by giving to your son he will learn that he can get his way when he behaves meanly or badly. The problem with that assessment is that it believes that  Lukas enjoys, or at least doesn&#39;t mind, being angry and tense and stressed and yelling. I don&#39;t like that feeling that way. It hurts, my stomach hurts, my head hurts, I get thirsty, it isn&#39;t any fun. I don&#39;t imagine that Lukas enjoys that feeling either. If instead of looking at it from your friend&#39;s perspective, look at it from his, if he can see his mom reaching out to help him when he is angry and upset, when his stress cup is full (as Robyn put it) he will feel supported. Just that support will help to empty some of his stress. It won&#39;t empty it. It isn&#39;t a cure-all. But it will help. Figuring out how to negotiate with big emotions, with intense feelings is a hard job. If  you can help him to have the space and the<br/>\n time to move from rage to calm, and it can take hours particularly at first, he will be better equipped to deal with those feelings as he ages. I didn&#39;t have help and I have big anger issues still. Linnaea and I try and coach each other, she will tell me to breathe when I start to get angry. Helping Linnaea is helping me as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: halfshadow1 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:halfshadow1@...\">halfshadow1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 2 February, 2008 5:13:31 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Have him evaluated?<br/>\n<br/>\n-I limited his Nintendo play because what she said(friend) She said<br/>\nit&#39;s not good for him to be frustrated all the time, that i wouldn&#39;t<br/>\ngive my son alcohol,bad food..why give hin the nintendo that<br/>\nfrustrates him and because when he played outside he got TIRED!

I tell him i just sat down and he can sit next to me. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; an instant fit!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would try hey sit next to me and then a tickle and playful- hey I <br/>\nwould love to get of your couch and sit in this nice chair. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n A hour hour later son is playing with a toy and having<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some trouble, i offer to help but he screams no! I hate you! I <br/>\n </span></blockquote>quit!<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  I&#39;m leaving this house!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>my daughter did this too- we started a game called &quot;your out of the <br/>\nfamily&quot; so I would laugh and say well your out of the family so good <br/>\nbye andthen she would laugh-- if she walked out the door I would not <br/>\nchase her because she would then realize I was behind her and be <br/>\nable to save her but by not going after her she realized wuickly she <br/>\nwas on her own- this may work only for some kids who would realize <br/>\nthat they were on their own. She has not done this in a long time<br/>\n<br/>\n I told my friend that i<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; thought by nursing him until 4yo,sleeping with him, respecting<br/>\n&gt; him,unschooling,etc. that he would be nice to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just because you are nice to someone does not make it all click- <br/>\nThis was the biggest problem with attachment parenting it was just <br/>\nabout being nice<br/>\n<br/>\nhe needs something eles- sometimes I would tell my daughter- when <br/>\nyou yell at me it makes me feel like not getting that for you but <br/>\nsince I love you I will. The other day she started yelling when a <br/>\nfriend was here who conventionally parents and I saw her hold her <br/>\nbreath to see what punishment my daughter got- I raised my voice to <br/>\nher level and said- why are you yelling- then she said something and <br/>\nI said you are yelling because you are fursterrated. Then it was over<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughters are now 5 and 3 and they have changed so much in the <br/>\nlast year of unschooling and I would not change it- does not mean <br/>\nthey never rage or meltdown but it is few and far between now and <br/>\nusually when they are tired. So yes they CAN change but sometimes <br/>\nthey do not and if you have been doing this for a while instead of <br/>\nthinking he will change try thinking that you will find ways to cope <br/>\nand deal with it and not expect him to be different<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n My friend said i<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; shouldn&#39;t blame myself, That i am doing everything right. Maybe <br/>\n </span></blockquote>it&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; food, allergy or something else. Should i get him evaluated?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>what do you want to find out? If there is a magical reason he is <br/>\nacting this way and a magical fix? Stop thinking about fixing him <br/>\nand just love him and live with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nevaluated for what? at best you will get some form ADD or ADHA or <br/>\nsensory issues, maybe aspie scale- they will probably want to put <br/>\nhim on meds even though it will not fix or end the behavior and you <br/>\nwill spend the next forever years going from med to med from dose to <br/>\ndose and it will NEVER get better. You know he is high energy, <br/>\nspirtited, what more do you want to know. <br/>\n<br/>\n My husband<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; said he acts this way because he&#39;s with me all the time. That he <br/>\n </span></blockquote>needs<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to go somewhere with someone else or other kids for awhile.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>not true- though my mom thought this a little bit too. Putting him <br/>\naround other kids will not help and probably hurt them or him<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n My husband<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; said it&#39;s so bad he doesn&#39;t want to take him anywhere...anymore. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Son<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; had his friend over today and he is not to kind to his friend.  my<br/>\n&gt; husband does take him where he asks to go. please give me advice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What do you think he needs from you? From dad? does he need more say <br/>\nso- more &quot;if--- then&quot; stuff- this works good with my two &quot;if you go <br/>\npotty I will fix your drink&quot;-- If you pick up toys with me then we <br/>\ncan read books- most the time they do it but sometimes I get a no <br/>\nand that is ok too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

Risk assessment needed. You <br/>\ndon&#39;t need our permission, you know. People have stories of positive <br/>\nexperiences, and negative ones. Try searching archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers *definitely* can give you tools to work with that can help you <br/>\nbe an Unschooling mindful parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is most likely going on is that your son is six, spirited, free and <br/>\nloved.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur free little children don&#39;t look like controlled, molded, shamed, <br/>\nrewarded/punished, directed little children. They often look wild, fearless, <br/>\ndetermined, raw. Sometimes they look too big for a controlled, disciplined, <br/>\n&quot;proper&quot; society. They experiment. They feel and express themselves, <br/>\nincluding their negative emotions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen suddenly, like a miracle that we don&#39;t notice until after it is <br/>\naccomplished - like the peach tree suddenly being covered in blooms - our <br/>\nwild, difficult, outspoken little children, are creative, open, thoughtful, <br/>\noutspoken yet courteous, loving, acceptant and tolerant, self-aware and <br/>\noptimistic teenagers and young adults. They aren&#39;t secretly self <br/>\ndestructive, or strangers to their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She said his behaviour is not apropriate(sp) that it&#39;s verbal<br/>\nabuse and when you go out people don&#39;t treat each other like that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSee I think this is a *very* mainstream judgmental attitude, and is probably <br/>\nnot helping your serenity. If you choose to label your son as an &quot;abuser&quot; it <br/>\nis so much harder to be compassionate to him. We can choose the descriptors <br/>\nwe use. Your son is 6 and struggling and probably feels powerless. He is not <br/>\nan adult with power abusing you. Perhaps he needs more help than a child to <br/>\nwhom social niceties come easily. Maybe he needs not to be taken to places <br/>\nthat trigger his behavior or spark fears. Sometimes it is something as <br/>\nsimple as flickering neon lights. (In Jayn&#39;s case, big echoey places, big <br/>\ndark places.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly there is a time to explain that people shouldn&#39;t treat each other <br/>\nbadly. That time is not in the middle of a meltdown. But it is also <br/>\nimportant to consider what is possible and achievable for any individual <br/>\nchild&#39;s development level. Constantly expecting more from him than he can <br/>\ntruly give will only make him feel worse about himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
