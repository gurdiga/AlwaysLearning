In our family of 5, there is definitely a<br/>\n&gt;  range of intro/extrovert personalities, and although I do not refer<br/>\n&gt;  to ourselves by those terms in day to day conversation, learning more<br/>\n&gt;  about them has definitely informed me. Apparently there are some<br/>\n&gt;  very good books about the nature of introvert personalities and how<br/>\n&gt;  they can best be nurtured and supported. I simply found the<br/>\n&gt;  definitions in one of the books I read, I think Raising Your Spirited<br/>\n&gt;  Child, and found them to be thought provoking and helpful.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  For me, after discovering the terminology, and how it might apply to<br/>\n&gt;  my children (a little light switch of awareness being turned on in my<br/>\n&gt;  head, so to speak), it has been really cool to see how awareness of<br/>\n&gt;  preferences and communication of those preferences breeds more choice<br/>\n&gt;  and more communication. For example, my oldest does not prefer large<br/>\n&gt;  group activities, and she takes a long time to &quot;adjust&quot; to people,<br/>\n&gt;  her terminology. Learning this helped me to focus more on discussing<br/>\n&gt;  activities beforehand, so that we could figure out which ones might<br/>\n&gt;  be appealing and which ones wouldn&#39;t. Through this extra<br/>\n&gt;  communication, I think she has developed a habit of being aware of<br/>\n&gt;  which situations feel right and which don&#39;t. This sounds really<br/>\n&gt;  technical, but it isn&#39;t, just plain talk about what she thinks and<br/>\n&gt;  feels, at a child&#39;s level. Over time, though, it has led to a very<br/>\n&gt;  concrete ability on her part to say what she wants, which seems like<br/>\n&gt;  a good thing to me. This same awareness seems to be developing in my<br/>\n&gt;  younger two as they grow and mature. Does your son feel comfortable<br/>\n&gt;  talking about what he wants and doesn&#39;t want? At five, he may not<br/>\n&gt;  articulate himself in adult language, but should be able to express<br/>\n&gt;  preferences that can give you an indication. Shutting down at a<br/>\n&gt;  library/playgroup event may be an opportunity to ask him a few light<br/>\n&gt;  questions. Also, what do you define as shutting down? Is he an<br/>\n&gt;  intense observer, by any chance? I don&#39;t have one, but have known<br/>\n&gt;  one, and it is pretty common, I think, and not an indication of<br/>\n&gt;  shutting down in any way, in fact could be quite the opposite. If<br/>\n&gt;  he&#39;s at the activity hanging on you and asking to go home, that would<br/>\n&gt;  be a different story altogether.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  There is not that much of an age difference between your older son<br/>\n&gt;  and younger, and so while he may see the new friendships of his older<br/>\n&gt;  brother and feel some envy, he might also still be really attached to<br/>\n&gt;  the &quot;nest,&quot; so social needs may not have surfaced which need to be<br/>\n&gt;  met outside of the home at his initiation. Also, having always had<br/>\n&gt;  an older sibling, if his older brother has been providing the social<br/>\n&gt;  impetus, then maybe he just needs more practice doing this on his<br/>\n&gt;  own. It&#39;s got to be an adjustment to not have his brother around,<br/>\n&gt;  and to be placing social expectations on him in addition to that<br/>\n&gt;  could be overly burdensome. If the older brother is having lots of<br/>\n&gt;  playdates, is it possible for the younger brother to participate to<br/>\n&gt;  some degree when he desires? Do they get along well enough at home<br/>\n&gt;  that the older brother would be willing to include his younger<br/>\n&gt;  brother sometimes, enough to fill the younger brother&#39;s cup, but not<br/>\n&gt;  so much that it feels intrusive to the older? If the younger brother<br/>\n&gt;  is excluded, is it because the relationship is weak to begin with, or<br/>\n&gt;  is it because the older brother is getting pressure from his<br/>\n&gt;  schoolmate to do so? To me it would seem totally natural to have all<br/>\n&gt;  of the kids play together and whoever wants to participate can,<br/>\n&gt;  whoever doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t, but perhaps that is not what is happening,<br/>\n&gt;  which would be, to me, an opportunity for thought and possible<br/>\n&gt;  discussion between yourself and each of the boys.<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Take care,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  Kelly<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  On Jan 8, 2008, at 5:23 AM, Tami wrote:<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m not new to this group, but took a &quot;year off&quot; from it while our<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; life was going thru some<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; changes.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;m now a firm believer in finding and doing what&#39;s best for the<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; individual, and what&#39;s good<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; for one child may not be good for another one. Yeah, it seems<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; intuitive now, but this past<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; year was...one of the biggest challenges of my life trying to learn<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; this. As a result of this<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;new&quot; understanding, my oldest son (6.5 yrs) now goes to a charter<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; school and its working<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; out great for his specific needs.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I am still unschooling my younger son and I love it, but I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; struggling with some questions<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; regarding him. His older brother is an extrovert and extremely<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; outgoing. Everybody is his<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; best friend, and now that he&#39;s in a school environment, he has a<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; lot of friends. My other<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; son, however, is the exact opposite. He is very introverted,<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; bashful, shy... He has no<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; friends.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I&#39;ve tried joining local homeschool groups, doing library story<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; time, etc., but he gets<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; overwhelmed in large groups and just sorta shuts down. He seems to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; do much better<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; one-on-one, so I&#39;ve tried organizing play dates at our home or<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; places around town with<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; just one other &quot;friend&quot;, but he doesnt seem to want to have<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; anything to do with that either.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; He seems very lonely (even tho he also has a younger sister at<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; home), and seems envious<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; of his older brother and his friends.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; On top of this, I have a few family memebers who are pressuring me<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; about his<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;socialization&quot;. I have never been one to worry about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; &quot;socialization&quot;, because I know for<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; most home/unschoolers that&#39;s a non-issue. But I am starting to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; worry just a little about<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; my son.<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; I suppose if we didn&#39;t have the influence of his older brother, it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; wouldn&#39;t even occur to me<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; to worry about him. But when I watch him watch his brother and<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; friends so longingly, it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; makes my heart ache. Both my husband and I were also extremely shy<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; growing up, and it<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; just hurts to see him going thru similar things. But, of course, we<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; were forced to go to<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; school, which made it worse in so many ways, but eventually we both<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; did find a friend or<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; two that way...<br/>\n&gt;  &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  &gt; Anyone have any thoughts on this?

In our family of 5, there is definitely a  <br/>\nrange of intro/extrovert personalities, and although I do not refer  <br/>\nto ourselves by those terms in day to day conversation, learning more  <br/>\nabout them has definitely informed me.  Apparently there are some  <br/>\nvery good books about the nature of introvert personalities and how  <br/>\nthey can best be nurtured and supported.  I simply found the  <br/>\ndefinitions in one of the books I read, I think Raising Your Spirited  <br/>\nChild, and found them to be thought provoking and helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, after discovering the terminology, and how it might apply to  <br/>\nmy children (a little light switch of awareness being turned on in my  <br/>\nhead, so to speak), it has been really cool to see how awareness of  <br/>\npreferences and communication of those preferences breeds more choice  <br/>\nand more communication.  For example, my oldest does not prefer large  <br/>\ngroup activities, and she takes a long time to &quot;adjust&quot; to people,  <br/>\nher terminology.  Learning this helped me to focus more on discussing  <br/>\nactivities beforehand, so that we could figure out which ones might  <br/>\nbe appealing and which ones wouldn&#39;t.  Through this extra  <br/>\ncommunication, I think she has developed a habit of being aware of  <br/>\nwhich situations feel right and which don&#39;t.  This sounds really  <br/>\ntechnical, but it isn&#39;t, just plain talk about what she thinks and  <br/>\nfeels, at a child&#39;s level.  Over time, though, it has led to a very  <br/>\nconcrete ability on her part to say what she wants, which seems like  <br/>\na good thing to me.  This same awareness seems to be developing in my  <br/>\nyounger two as they grow and mature.  Does your son feel comfortable  <br/>\ntalking about what he wants and doesn&#39;t want?  At five, he may not  <br/>\narticulate himself in adult language, but should be able to express  <br/>\npreferences that can give you an indication.  Shutting down at a  <br/>\nlibrary/playgroup event may be an opportunity to ask him a few light  <br/>\nquestions.  Also, what do you define as shutting down?  Is he an  <br/>\nintense observer, by any chance?  I don&#39;t have one, but have known  <br/>\none, and it is pretty common, I think, and not an indication of  <br/>\nshutting down in any way, in fact could be quite the opposite.  If  <br/>\nhe&#39;s at the activity hanging on you and asking to go home, that would  <br/>\nbe a different story altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is not that much of an age difference between your older son  <br/>\nand younger, and so while he may see the new friendships of his older  <br/>\nbrother and feel some envy, he might also still be really attached to  <br/>\nthe &quot;nest,&quot; so social needs may not have surfaced which need to be  <br/>\nmet outside of the home at his initiation.  Also, having always had  <br/>\nan older sibling, if his older brother has been providing the social  <br/>\nimpetus, then maybe he just needs more practice doing this on his  <br/>\nown.  It&#39;s got to be an adjustment to not have his brother around,  <br/>\nand to be placing social expectations on him in addition to that  <br/>\ncould be overly burdensome.  If the older brother is having lots of  <br/>\nplaydates, is it possible for the younger brother to participate to  <br/>\nsome degree when he desires?  Do they get along well enough at home  <br/>\nthat the older brother would be willing to include his younger  <br/>\nbrother sometimes, enough to fill the younger brother&#39;s cup, but not  <br/>\nso much that it feels intrusive to the older?  If the younger brother  <br/>\nis excluded, is it because the relationship is weak to begin with, or  <br/>\nis it because the older brother is getting pressure from his  <br/>\nschoolmate to do so?  To me it would seem totally natural to have all  <br/>\nof the kids play together and whoever wants to participate can,  <br/>\nwhoever doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t, but perhaps that is not what is happening,  <br/>\nwhich would be, to me, an opportunity for thought and possible  <br/>\ndiscussion between yourself and each of the boys.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care,<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Jan 8, 2008, at 5:23 AM, Tami wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hi all,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not new to this group, but took a &quot;year off&quot; from it while our  <br/>\n&gt; life was going thru some<br/>\n&gt; changes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m now a firm believer in finding and doing what&#39;s best for the  <br/>\n&gt; individual, and what&#39;s good<br/>\n&gt; for one child may not be good for another one.

He&#39;s quiet and keeps himself to himself, as the saying goes, <br/>\nbut I wouldn&#39;t call him painfully timid and shy. He prefers his own <br/>\ncompany to the company of others. Well, so do I, so I don&#39;t see that <br/>\nas any big deal. But his demeanour definitely *is* very noticeably <br/>\ndifferent to that of his sister.
