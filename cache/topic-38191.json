Rosie  <br/>\n(now 17) had a few months of misery - really serious misery - after  <br/>\nhaving problems with her then-best friends. She was 12 or 13. Losing  <br/>\nthose friends meant being left out of the social stuff she&#39;d been  <br/>\ndepending on for her entire social life. She woke up in the morning  <br/>\nand was soon in tears over it - every day for several months. Then she  <br/>\nsomehow got her gumption together and decided to make herself a happy  <br/>\nand active social group and she did it. She called people and was  <br/>\npersistent and got various kids together to do things on a regular  <br/>\nbasis. She let herself be completely open to being friends with anyone  <br/>\navailable. She started some new activities. Over time, she developed a  <br/>\nfantastic social group that she&#39;s thrilled with - they get together to  <br/>\nplay games, mostly, and also to go to movies. She still tends to be  <br/>\nthe &quot;organizer&quot; of the group - she&#39;s the one who mostly calls or text  <br/>\nmessages people and says, &quot;Hey, a bunch of us are going to see a movie  <br/>\non Tuesday afternoon if you want to go.&quot; She had to really take a lot  <br/>\nof initiative to get herself over not having the girl friends she&#39;d  <br/>\ndepended on before but she&#39;s VERY glad, now, that it all happened and  <br/>\nshe&#39;s very very happy with her social life. Even in the last few weeks  <br/>\nshe&#39;s just suddenly exclaimed, out of nowhere, &quot;I LOVE my friends - I  <br/>\nhave such cool friends!&quot;  She also got closer to her sisters - partly  <br/>\nthat was because she got old enough to be more of a friend to hang out  <br/>\nwith - to have fun together -  her sisters are 3 and 6 years older  <br/>\nthan she is. She also took up martial arts about then - with my pretty  <br/>\nstrong urging to just try it - and that became a very strong passion  <br/>\nand the martial arts studio provided a built-in social group, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I hope some of that might help.

Anyway, she&#39;s<br/>\nbeen in school for almost 3 weeks and is making a lot of friends and<br/>\nenjoying that aspect of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat she doesn&#39;t like is school itself (shocker...I know... [;)] ).  She<br/>\nhas sooo much homework and well, I won&#39;t go into all the pointless,<br/>\nmindless, worthless stuffs she&#39;s doing.  I&#39;m guessing you all have a<br/>\npretty good idea about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s exhausted.  This is a busy girl.  After and 8 hour day, she did<br/>\nhomework, went to 2 hours of cheerleading and then came home and went to<br/>\nher good friends house a couple doors down.   A little before ten I<br/>\ncalled her (cause she usually hits the hay by ten) just to make sure<br/>\nnothing happened on the way home.  She was already on her way and just<br/>\nlost track of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she got home she just started crying and wanting to be held.  She<br/>\nstill &quot;had to&quot; take a shower, and clean the guinnea pigs cage and pick<br/>\nout her clothes and she said &quot; I just don&#39;t  want to go to school!&quot;  I<br/>\nsaid, showe r in the morning, dad already did the cage, I&#39;ll pick out<br/>\nyour clothes and you don&#39;t have to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was so tired and it wasn&#39;t a good time to really talk.  But we<br/>\nchatted a little about her choices.  She said she really likes the<br/>\nfriends at school but she just doesn&#39;t know what to do.  I suggest she<br/>\ntakes tomorrow off and she ended up wanting to go cause she&#39;s having a<br/>\nsleep over at one of her friends houses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I want to talk to her some more this weekend.
