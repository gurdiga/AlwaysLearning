Thats amazing and gives me hope. Loooking back over the last 2 years Celyn has made huge strides froma  baby not expected to live or be a vegetable to an opiniated little red haired madam. having the ed Psych tell us she wasn&#39;t retarded was the best thing ever (and I mean no disrespect to people who are retarded or have mental impairments.)<br/>\n  Hubby and I give Celyn 100% input all the time to help her. Some of it is a bit against my principles -  for example, Celyn has already realised that trying to reach is tough. So she doesn&#39;t do it, she knows her minions will hold the toy for her or press her switch. So I&#39;m telling her if she doesn&#39;t press her switch then the toy wont move and I ain&#39;t doing it. I also make her signal yes and no or pick up rather than make assumptions. She has tantrums sometimes about being made to do stuff but heck, she&#39;s 2.<br/>\n  But thanks for that.

But its a cortical blindness. There&#39;s nothing wrong with her eyes. Hopefully, with lots of work we can train her brain to see again.<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe question might be whether having her at home is better than  <br/>\nhaving her in an institution, not whether natural learning is going  <br/>\nto help her like a carseat.

She&#39;s like any 2 year old would be if you tied them up and blindfolded them. She wants but can&#39;t *do*!<br/>\n  But I&#39;m hoping that one day someone will say &#39;hey, I tried this and it worked.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your whole family is trapped at home, will unschooling work for  <br/>\nany of the kids anymore?<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, they are pretty do their own thing anyway. The boys play computer and Magic all day, go to the park, go get groceries etc. H chose to go back to school last September cos she actually likes structured learning. She said she felt like she wasn&#39;t learning academic stuff with my methods. She seems to be enjoying it and knows she can leave at any point but she likes getting A&#39;s in tests. Its just her prefered method. Bit weird to me but we&#39;re all different. I do worry about this will change her values, the whole A = worthwhile person type thing but its her journey.<br/>\n  Hubby and I are discussing him giving up work and becoming Celyn&#39; s full time carer. there&#39;s many reasons, mostly my health and slipped disc in my back but the boys are right up there. Once DH is at home then I can do stuff with the boys. There will be time. The last 3 weeks DH has been home and when C&#39;s respite carers have been here he&#39;s taken them digging on our allotment which they love, he&#39;s played Magic with them, done electronics, made cakes. Its what I always pictured unschooling to be! There just needs to be 2 of us to do it. I took them to a hands on science thing they asked to go too.<br/>\n  But I am doing my best to make things ok despite the extra stuff Celyn brings.<br/>\n  (but I could do with 6 pairs of hands and a lottery win....)<br/>\n  S  <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n  YAHOO!

Both of these are thoughts<br/>\nthat I can change, and when I change them I am doing so as a way of being<br/>\nmore compassionate and respectful toward *mySelf*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the thoughts themselves that perpetuate how I&#39;m feeling.

She wont sit in a chair to be fed but she&#39;s now becoming too heavy to feed on a lap, she hates going in the car seat and screams the entire journey, she screams in shops cos she hates shops, she screams in her wheelchair cos she hates that and wants to be carried.<br/>\n  I just don&#39;t know how to get through to her.

Punishment includes hitting,  <br/>\nspanking, swatting, shaming, ridiculing, threatening, using harsh or  <br/>\ncruel words, penalizing, holding back rewards, or other methods that  <br/>\nassert adult power or vent adult frustration.

Change how you see them and their behavior. Change  <br/>\nhow you interact with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssume that kids are doing the best they can with the skills they  <br/>\nhave. Be their partner rather than their molder and shaper.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will probably be rough. Ask lots of question here! If you&#39;ve been  <br/>\ncontrolling them, they&#39;re going to test what were previously limits.  <br/>\n(I wouldn&#39;t suggest eliminating all rules. If you&#39;ve used &quot;I do this  <br/>\nbecause I care,&quot; as an method to get them to do what you want, it&#39;s  <br/>\ngoing to seem like you don&#39;t care if you let go of rules all of a  <br/>\nsudden.) Your goal isn&#39;t to obey rules but to make choices based on  <br/>\nprinciples. But it will be difficult getting. Though not any more  <br/>\ndifficult than what you&#39;re doing now.

It will help lots to not see it as them taking  <br/>\nadvantage of you but healing from the control. Controlled people  <br/>\noften don&#39;t respect those controlling them. It&#39;s a form of self  <br/>\nprotection. And it will take a while before they trust that you&#39;re on  <br/>\ntheir side, there to help them get what they want rather than being  <br/>\ntheir adversary in getting them to do what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about it this way: If your husband had the power to make you do  <br/>\nthings you didn&#39;t believe were best for you, would you respect him  <br/>\nand his ideas? In a situation like that the options are: pretending  <br/>\nand then sneaking behind his back to do what you think is right,  <br/>\nfighting against his control of you, or giving up and accepting that  <br/>\nyou don&#39;t know anything and should just go along with whatever he  <br/>\ntells you to. Is that what you want?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is that if you&#39;ve relaxed rules and then given up and  <br/>\nput them back, it encourages them to believe that any relaxation of  <br/>\nrules is only temporary and they need to take advantage of the  <br/>\nfreedom while they have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211613748,"authorName":"lilith_pouia","from":"&quot;lilith_pouia&quot; &lt;lilith_pouia@...&gt;","profile":"lilith_pouia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"confused about punishment","postDate":"1144551813","msgId":25035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxOXRpNSsxNDlnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":25036,"prevInTime":25034,"nextInTime":25036,"topicId":25035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been part of this group for a while, and haven t actually asked for the support i need and needed when i joined.

So i thought i&#39;d<br/>\npost, and ask for some advice on one of the many topics i probably<br/>\nneed advice about. My sons are seven and four, and i<br/>\nhomeschool/unschool them. Our normal methods of punishment include<br/>\ngrounding and time outs, and when the kids don&#39;t respond to those<br/>\nspanking. I&#39;ve been reading the articles about not spanking on the<br/>\nSanda Dodd website, and i really dislike the idea and act of spanking<br/>\nmy sons, but i don&#39;t understand how to respond when grounding and time<br/>\nouts don&#39;t work. I assume it would have been easier on me and them if<br/>\ni had practiced different approaches to parenting earlier, but what<br/>\ncan i do now to help change their habits of misbehavior and my habits<br/>\nof how i respond to it? It seems like trying to be more compassionate<br/>\nand respectful toward them is just something they use to take<br/>\nadvantage of me. Any advice will be open mindedly considered and<br/>\nappreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLilith</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25063,"nextTopicId":25093}}
