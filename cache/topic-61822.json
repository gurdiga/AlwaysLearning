It seemed that the Waldorf inspired charter would be her choice (and DH&#39;s) but a few things have since also been added to the mix:<br/>\n<br/>\n1). DH started working full-time, and we agreed that the choice of education should be heavily influenced by what I felt would work best for me since I would be home with our 5 and 2.5 year old girls.<br/>\n<br/>\n2). We moved to a place better suited for Unschooling, and are making it a better Unschooling nest.<br/>\n<br/>\n3). We started deschooling, initially making the choice for DD1 to stay home with me instead of sending her to camp (mostly to help make the move happen more efficiently).  One morning of tears and disappointment, but she then told me that she would rather be with me than go to either of the 2 camps she had been to.<br/>\n<br/>\n4). DD1 told me I was her best friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n5). Tonight was an ice cream social at the Waldorf-inspired charter and she chose to put on a Phillies hat (US sports team) and Hello Kitty gloves.  When I explained that she was not allowed to wear those at the Waldorf-inspired school (we discussed this before, too) she protested and said, &quot;It&#39;s not fair!  I don&#39;t want to go there!&quot;. She explained to me that she was wearing the sports team hat because she missed her dad (his fave team).  I suggested that we go anyway and I could go with her to speak with her teacher about the dress code.  DD1 simply said that she didn&#39;t want to go there anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spoken with DD1 about the things she liked about the Waldorf-inspired school and I will remind her again this weekend, explaining that to withdraw means that she won&#39;t be able to change her mind later this year (or perhaps in the future as it&#39;s a difficult lottery).  Though I would like to unschool, I want to make sure she is making as informed a choice as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for all the suggestions given here to my OP, I decided to think about who DD1 is -- she is assertive and articulate.  DH and I have tried our best to be responsive parents and I think that has supported her assertiveness.  I would give her what I could to help her make a choice and if she seemed overwhelmed by it, I would simply make the best choice I could given what I had observed so far.  Fortunately, she didn&#39;t need me to point out the differences between being with me and being at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to add that while DH was not necessarily convinced before about Unschooling, my gut feeling was pushing me towards it, thinking that DH would see the benefit.  If I had waited to convince him based solely on philosophical, hypothetical discussions, I may have never been able to head down this road with his blessing.  This is again, a choice I made based on my observations of who my DH is and our relationship.  In neither situation am I suggesting others should make the same choices, but I mention them because it may trigger something for someone who is in a similar enough circumstance...<br/>\n<br/>\nOur girls are happy and getting along the best I&#39;ve ever seen them.  Both are really helpful at times with things I am working on (chores, cooking) and we are having fun deschooling!  And, tonight, explaining DD1&#39;s choice to DH, he was fine with it, while he was looking for the cables to hook up the DVD player so that DD2 could watch her movie while eating in the living room at 10pm.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis from my DH who was once strictly no TV, no eating anywhere but the dining room table and strict bedtimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a brief discussion with DH tonight about being with the girls, he mentioned how unrewarding being the childcare giver was for him.  I told him that I felt it was completely rewarding for me.  I think the deschooling helps -- a lot :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Unschoolers for helping my family so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, how long do I deschool?!!<br/>\n<br/>\nCeci</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Too much choice?","postDate":"1310727230","msgId":61831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1RDVFRTNDLUU2RUMtNDg5Qy05NDJFLTZFODg5Mjc1OUQ2RUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PERBNDBDMDlELTM3MkYtNDk3My05NTg0LUJCNEY3Mzg0RDBCNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGl2b2c2MitqMWZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8REE0MEMwOUQtMzcyRi00OTczLTk1ODQtQkI0RjczODREMEI1QHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":61830,"nextInTopic":62501,"prevInTime":61830,"nextInTime":61832,"topicId":61822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Some kids get overwhelmed by choices when they don t have strong feelings about something.

Before that, a child can&#39;t make a longterm decision, and shouldn&#39;t be expected to.   But decisions made about little things during the day is a way to practice for ever larger decisions so that by the time they are old enough to make larger decisions involving money and years of commitment, they will have some experience to help them decide.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Too much choice?","postDate":"1310725404","msgId":61829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBNDBDMDlELTM3MkYtNDk3My05NTg0LUJCNEY3Mzg0RDBCNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGl2b2c2MitqMWZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGl2b2c2MitqMWZxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61828,"nextInTopic":61830,"prevInTime":61828,"nextInTime":61830,"topicId":61822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Then there is the child&#39;s birth date compared to the birth date cut off for entrance.  In Missouri you have to be 5 no later than the end of July to enter kindergarten - and in the Kansas City, MO school district (they just changed it this year and we have special rules for our district as well as St Louis) you have to be 5 no later than the end of September.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI say Kansas City did it to have an influx of money this year - if they bring in a few more kindergarteners this year they get more money from the state and federal government this year.  It&#39;s not like the Children in St Louis and Kansas City are more ready at a younger age ?????<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started school in Illinois back in 1967 we had no Kindergarten, we just started with first grade.  You just had to be 6 by the end of December to start first grade.  My husband went to kindergarten in Denver, Colorado.  I really can tell no difference in our &quot;education&quot;  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some countries have later start ages and their children do really well.  I think it is Finland? that does not start their children on reading until much later and they read better than other countries&#39; children.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo some research and some thinking.  It sounds like you are stressed out about this HUGE decision and once you make the decision that it is a FOREVER decision.  Think of it in terms of we are going to try this and if it does not work out we can always do something else.  You might even find something else further along in time that seems like an even better option.

But at 4 - or even 5 for that matter - she can&#39;t really conceptualize a Whole Year of school much less an education. So in that sense, its not her choice, it can&#39;t possibly be her choice other than on a day by day basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill either school give you the flexibility to make decisions on a day by day basis? The Waldorf school, in particular, might not - its something to ask! But some of those kinds of private programs insist that its disruptive for kids to come some days but not every day, even if the parents are willing to pay for the whole thing, regardless. Is your husband willing to let her make that kind of day-by-day decision about school? Or will he push for her to go, like it or not? If he&#39;s likely to push for her to go, once y&#39;all have paid for the program, that&#39;s something to consider in your decision making. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Merediht</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Too much choice?","postDate":"1310577130","msgId":61823,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTA1NzcxMzAuMzY4MC5ZYWhvb01haWxSQ0B3ZWI4NzMwMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDlFMUMxMjUzLUEwOTYtNEVGOS1BNUE0LUFBRkZBNzk1MzU0MkB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDlFMUMxMjUzLUEwOTYtNEVGOS1BNUE0LUFBRkZBNzk1MzU0MkB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":61822,"nextInTopic":61824,"prevInTime":61822,"nextInTime":61824,"topicId":61822,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When I was 6 my mom and dad decided to explore other schools, schools not public.
