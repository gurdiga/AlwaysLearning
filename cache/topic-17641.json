If she wasn&#39;t ready, she wouldn&#39;t have been interested and<br/>\nshe wouldn&#39;t have learned. Reading aloud is the start; demonstrating that<br/>\nreading is normal and interesting by reading yourself is part of the<br/>\nprocess, too. My own son, Alex &quot;broke the code&quot; for himself at about age 5,<br/>\nby typing a caption from National Geographic on the computer; he opened a<br/>\nword processing program, got a new document, chose a typeface and size, and<br/>\nstarted copying this rather lengthy photo caption about sea stars. He was so<br/>\nintent on what he was doing! He looked from the magazine, written in italics<br/>\nand upper and lower case, to the keyboard to find the matching letter, to<br/>\nthe screen, where he saw the connection between the printed magazine&#39;s words<br/>\nand the ones he was typing. You couldn&#39;t make a curriculum or a lesson or a<br/>\nmethod out of that; it was his way, in his time. Not too much later, he was<br/>\nreading aloud from Calvin and Hobbes into a tape recorder; his idea, not<br/>\nmine! <br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep providing the things that interest her.  My son wouldn&#39;t sit still for<br/>\nphonics, but once he understood the connection between letters on the page<br/>\nand what he heard, he could read any word already in his vocabulary.  He did<br/>\nthe same typing thing with the entire book, &quot;Ferdinand.&quot;  He got tired,<br/>\nthough, and had me finish it - then print it - in 40 point all caps.<br/>\nBetween the National Geographic and Ferdinand, he learned to read.  For<br/>\n&quot;sounding out,&quot; Dr. Suess&#39;s made-up words and names can&#39;t be beat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you&#39;re &quot;getting it&quot; to me :-)))<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, did you (the List You) know &quot;Suess&quot; should be pronounced &quot;Zoice&quot; (like<br/>\nvoice with a Z)?
