And better than the technicality is that he used it for a real <br/>\nreason, and he wrote something sweet to a stranger just because.  He&#39;s making <br/>\nthe world a little better for this costumer/artist and for the friend for whom <br/>\nhe&#39;s buying the surprise shades.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSubject: Re: About Vash Shades<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Date: Tue, 3 Jun 2003 01:02:45 EDT<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Hey.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yeah I am interested!  How do you want payment? And what all do you need to<br/>\n&gt;know.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;I looked around your website and I gotta tell you. Your costumes are <br/>\n&gt;Awesome!<br/>\n&gt;I myself have been a huge Black Mage fan sense...I can remember. And when<br/>\n&gt;Final Fantasy X came out Lulu jumped to the top of the list. You most <br/>\n&gt;likely hear<br/>\n&gt;this all the time but in any case I think your Lulu Costume is one of the<br/>\n&gt;best I have ever seen.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Well let me know how it all works.<br/>\n&gt;Kirby. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15043,"nextTopicId":15011}}
