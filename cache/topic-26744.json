Obviously <br/>\nwe&#39;re already learning at home, and plan on that flowing continuously <br/>\ninto Eli&#39;s older years. School isn&#39;t for us. I have a background in <br/>\nMontessori, but after recently looking into Waldorf there are aspects <br/>\nwhich really appeal to me there too so I&#39;ll be providing a little of <br/>\nboth flavours at home without things being overly structured.
