It must have seemed  like magic to her.  <br/>\nShe would pull one out, and another one would appear, and she&#39;d pull <br/>\nthat one out, and another one would appear.  My grandmother and my <br/>\nmother slipped into my body and I went to pull the box away from her, oh <br/>\nmy god, she was wasting that precious tissue, that I was going to blow <br/>\nmy  nose into--but as I got close I realized that she had the expression <br/>\nof utter delight.  She was happy, and around her were perfectly good <br/>\ntissues, they just were no longer neatly in the box.  I stopped myself, <br/>\nand thought about the situation<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tissues were about 99 cents a box.  Maybe a bit more.  By far the <br/>\ncheapest toy on the floor. <br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t hurting anything.<br/>\nShe wasn&#39;t hurting anybody.<br/>\nShe was really enjoying herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I let it go and she and I played with the box of tissue until it was <br/>\nempty.  Then she played with the empty box for a while.  She would stick <br/>\ntissue back in and try to get them to come out the same magical way they <br/>\ndid before, but it didn&#39;t really work.  So then she used the box for her <br/>\nother toys.  After she was clearly finished with the tissues themselves, <br/>\nI piled up what was usable and put it where it could be used... I tossed <br/>\nthe rest. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, that is my gage for a lot of things.  Is it hurting anyone?  <br/>\nhurting anything? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example would be halloween costumes.  I used to want to, for <br/>\nsome odd reason, want to put them away for--uh what exactly?  Instead I <br/>\nlet them wear them, play with them, use them for dress up, etc. etc. <br/>\netc.  After all, in a few months they won&#39;t fit.  What better way to get <br/>\ntheir money&#39;s worth...<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with fancy clothes.  I put it away, they wear it once.  I let them <br/>\nwear it all the time--and I get my money&#39;s worth. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, I say, bought a particular outfit for a particular outing, I would <br/>\nexpect my children to understand that it needs to be saved for that <br/>\nouting.  but after that, I think it&#39;s fair game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with everyone else... if they really want to wear their fancy <br/>\nclothing out to play in the mud, let &#39;um.  Buy clothes for cheap, get <br/>\nhand me downs.  In the long run, I would think that the memories of <br/>\nplaying in the mud in fancy clothing would be far better than the <br/>\nmemory  mom freaking out over a bit of fancy cloth that won&#39;t fit in six <br/>\nmonths anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, they could just do what my kids did, when they were younger and we <br/>\nhad a back yard that was rather secluded--they played in the mud sans <br/>\nclothing...<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:DACunefare@...\">DACunefare@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I assume you&#39;re wanting them to wear shorts under the dresses because <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; worrying about showing underwear as they play?

And hey, it&#39;s the height of garage sale season! Each of my <br/>\n&gt; girls had<br/>\n&gt; fancy dresses bought used, dirt cheap, that were either previously <br/>\n&gt; totally<br/>\n&gt; unworn (tags still on) or very ligthly worn. The girls were happy with <br/>\n&gt; fancy stuff<br/>\n&gt; to play in, and I was happy because I hadn&#39;t spent a bunch.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Seriously, my strategy with all clothes, not just &quot;play clothes&quot;, was <br/>\n&gt; to make<br/>\n&gt; sure that I didn&#39;t have any emotional attachment to how the child wore <br/>\n&gt; them<br/>\n&gt; or what they did with them. This was best accomplished around here by <br/>\n&gt; spending<br/>\n&gt; as little as possible yet still having a fantastic wardrobe the kids <br/>\n&gt; loved.<br/>\n&gt; (My boys could go through the knees of a pair of jeans in a month, new <br/>\n&gt; OR used -<br/>\n&gt; if it was a $4 pair from the thrift store it was no big deal but a $20 <br/>\n&gt; pair,<br/>\n&gt; ack!)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Learn to bargain down garage sale sellers. Go on the last day when <br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; staring at stuff they really don&#39;t want to take back in the house. <br/>\n&gt; Fancy dresses<br/>\n&gt; often have fancy prices, and sometimes you&#39;ll hear &quot;Do you know how <br/>\n&gt; much this<br/>\n&gt; is worth?&quot; in reply to a low offer, but hey, the answer to that is <br/>\n&gt; whatever<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s worth TO YOU, not what they spent for it before their daughter <br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; allowed to wear it much. :)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t forget to look at bigger sizes! Prom and bridesmaid dresses can be<br/>\n&gt; fairly easily sized down for super fancy duds for little people with <br/>\n&gt; strategic<br/>\n&gt; pleating.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Aw, I miss those days.

They&#39;re not underwear, and <br/>\nyet the girls still get the feel of bare legs that shorts sabotage.<br/>\n<br/>\nHie thee down to the closest thrift stores and start looking for used fancy <br/>\ndresses. And hey, it&#39;s the height of garage sale season! Each of my girls had <br/>\nfancy dresses bought used, dirt cheap, that were either previously totally <br/>\nunworn (tags still on) or very ligthly worn. The girls were happy with fancy stuff <br/>\nto play in, and I was happy because I hadn&#39;t spent a bunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, my strategy with all clothes, not just &quot;play clothes&quot;, was to make <br/>\nsure that I didn&#39;t have any emotional attachment to how the child wore them <br/>\nor what they did with them. This was best accomplished around here by spending <br/>\nas little as possible yet still having a fantastic wardrobe the kids loved. <br/>\n(My boys could go through the knees of a pair of jeans in a month, new OR used - <br/>\nif it was a $4 pair from the thrift store it was no big deal but a $20 pair, <br/>\nack!)<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn to bargain down garage sale sellers. Go on the last day when they&#39;re <br/>\nstaring at stuff they really don&#39;t want to take back in the house. Fancy dresses <br/>\noften have fancy prices, and sometimes you&#39;ll hear &quot;Do you know how much this <br/>\nis worth?&quot; in reply to a low offer, but hey, the answer to that is whatever <br/>\nit&#39;s worth TO YOU, not what they spent for it before their daughter wasn&#39;t <br/>\nallowed to wear it much. :) <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget to look at bigger sizes! Prom and bridesmaid dresses can be <br/>\nfairly easily sized down for super fancy duds for little people with strategic <br/>\npleating.<br/>\n<br/>\nAw, I miss those days. My babies are almost 30, 23 and the still home pair <br/>\nwill be 16 in 6 days.

Our suggestions will  <br/>\nbe hit or miss if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with yourself.  One  <br/>\nway to find out is to ask yourself questions.  When you are saying  <br/>\n&#39;no&#39; to playing outside with the dresses what are you saying &#39;yes&#39;  <br/>\nto?  You say the dresses will be ruined, so are you saying yes to  <br/>\nbeing frugal?  ... to order?  ... to care for people&#39;s things?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I find myself saying &#39;no&#39; I try to take a moment to get at what  <br/>\nmy &#39;yes&#39; really is.

You don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to &quot;let go&quot; of your desire - whatever it is.  And once you are  <br/>\naware of the issue then you can make better choices for meeting that  <br/>\nneed w/o hindering your relationship with your kids.  For example, if  <br/>\nyour need is to be frugal - well, you&#39;ve received a lot of ideas  <br/>\nalready for creating an abundance of outdoor play dresses while still  <br/>\nbeing frugal.  And, you can invite your kids to participate in the  <br/>\nprocess - which will bring you all closer together.  And it will feel  <br/>\nbetter, because you will be taking action to meet your need for being  <br/>\nfrugal rather than just closing the door with a &#39;no&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMahalo,<br/>\nBarbara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Clothes","postDate":"1210111910","msgId":34652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNzI0OC40Nzk3MS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzMzJkZjUwMDgwNTA2MDgxMHI3NGZjYmVlY2phYWY4Yjg2MjRiZTk3NWQ0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34651,"nextInTopic":34653,"prevInTime":34651,"nextInTime":34653,"topicId":34645,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Find plenty of play dresses, even fancy ones on second hand stores, cheap simple ones on Target.

My dd (9) Only wears dresses--and the <br/>\nfancier the better.  I&#39;m thinking that she may actually have the princess gene, because <br/>\nafter conversations about the possibility of ruined dresses, she&#39;s always decided to wear <br/>\nthem outside anyway--in the sandbox often--and she&#39;s hardly ruined a one!  I have so <br/>\nmany wonderful pictures of her playing all out looking like a princess--and we could have <br/>\nmade a big issue of it and not had all those joyous occasions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the possibility of damage is there, so our strategy until now has been to buy them at <br/>\nCostco because you can get the most beautiful dresses for $13.00, so I&#39;d just pick one up <br/>\nevery trip till we had the collection.

She really identifies herself as the girl <br/>\nwho does that--and she&#39;s unique in that regard, because most moms won&#39;t allow their <br/>\ndaughters to wear their best to the park.  My theory is that those are generally the clothes <br/>\nthat the most money are spent on, so why not get good use out of them!  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy MIL gave her a beautiful blue velvet dress from Nordstrom&#39;s that had been worn by a <br/>\ncousin.  She asked that Caroline not wear it except for fancy events because she wanted to <br/>\npass it down to another cousin.  I personally didn&#39;t appreciate this, because my MIL knows <br/>\nexactly who my daughter is and has helped to get other dresses that could be worn--and <br/>\nit was like torture for it to be in the closet and not touchable.  So one day my dd wore it <br/>\ninside the house, stood up while accidently standing on a sash and ripped it off.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nbelieve it came off--and she wasn&#39;t playing or anything--just sitting very calmly wearing <br/>\nthe dress.  (She likes to wear the ties down because they feel like ribbons to her, but the <br/>\nties on this dress were much longer than her other dresses.)  So now I have to get it to a <br/>\nseamstress to be repaired--so my feeling is that that dress was more trouble than it was <br/>\nworth!!  We thought we were respecting the spirit of the request--oh, well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing you could do is to see if your daughters will agree on one dress each that <br/>\ndoes not get worn for play so that it stays nice to be available when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;Also, when they do wear their few play dresses outside I ask that they wear<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; shorts underneath.

They also love<br/>\nto play outside. A lot of their dresses would be ruined if they played out<br/>\nside in them. So, when they get up and want to get dressed I remind them<br/>\nthat they should put on play clothes (most of the time not dresses, they<br/>\nhave few play dresses). They tell me they won&#39;t go outside. I don&#39;t argue<br/>\nwith them, I let them put the fancy clothes on. Then a bit later when they<br/>\nwant to go outside I let them know they have to put play clothes on first.<br/>\nThat is when I hear &quot;But mom...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure what to do. You guys always have great ideas, and I seem to be<br/>\nstuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when they do wear their few play dresses outside I ask that they wear<br/>\nshorts underneath. This mostly applies to my 4 year old. Then I end up<br/>\nfinding those shorts laying outside on the ground or on the porch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can I do about this? More specifically, how can I change my thinking?<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com\">http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy &quot;Working Toward Pro&quot; Photographs<br/>\nwww.hopescreations.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com\">http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34660,"nextTopicId":34491}}
