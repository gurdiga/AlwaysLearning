The article was all on one page! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nVery many blog posts in the world, when there are advertisements in the sidebar, are designed to get people in there and keep them there.  Many blogposts are cut and pasted from others—not so much people’s personal blogs, I mean, but the “news” and entertainment blogs.  Years back a letter I had was put in a blog called “Letters of Note.”  Dozens of other blogs wrote something about it, but mostly it was the stealing of two versions of a very short blurb.  Cut and paste, change the title.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of the first article, as I was reading it I was thinking “When?  Where was this study?”  There was no mention of a year, or a university, or a city, or a journal in which it might’ve been published.  Nor was there a researcher named.  The article seemed to imply that the named author was the researcher, but it didn’t state it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir description might have been based on an already-vague description, but I had hoped to be able to find other reports of the study to find out:<br/>\n<br/>\n—what were the participants given as compensation to be a part of the study, if anything<br/>\n—Was it school vacation/holiday, or a weekend?  That would matter, for teens.  [Schoolwork was mentioned, but was it over spring break where there were several days left, or was this taking a Saturday from a school kid?]  <br/>\n—were they in their own homes, or in an apartment owned by the researcher?  Did they have their own stuff, or a stranger’s stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, though, it seemed fishy to me.  And then to read what some of the kids did (one went to an amusement park?), they WERE in contact with others.  So I really wanted to see the original “contract,” because it seemed the experiment was worthlessly set up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I couldn’t find anything, and in looking found that second piece of writing by someone who also thought it sounded wrong and had also gone looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to the first link—it was presented in a subtly snarky way.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Others turned on the TV or plunged into playing computer games. In addition, almost all of them soon thrust their headphones into their ears.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTHRUST and PLUNGED ?  <br/>\nYikes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis, because of the way it is worded, becomes a flat-out lie:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-All of them, without any exceptions, said that they were extremely surprised by the thoughts that were crossing their minds during the experiment, but they were unable to examine them rationally because of the overall deterioration of their psychological state.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNONE of them said “I was unable to examine my thoughts rationally because of the overall deterioration of my psychological state.”  The sentence as written says that without exception, each participant (even those who quit early?) said they were shocked but didn’t have the means to examine their own thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is the biggest lie of all, but that is increasingly true of “journalism”—the headline.<br/>\n&quot;A thought-provoking experiment showed what happens when children don’t have the internet for a whole day”<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering, now, the writing itself and the lack of any documentation, I will not be surprised if this is tracked down and the study pre-dates the internet altogether.  Seriously. It was NOT about the internet.  It was about deprivation of human contact.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-They were allowed to describe how they felt at the time of the experiment, and keep a record their actions and thoughts. In the case of excessive anxiety, discomfort or stress the project leaders would recommend stopping the experiment immediately, recording the time and the reason for its termination.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere WERE these “project leaders”?  Were the kids being observed?<br/>\nAgain, the account has internal contradictions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have other thoughts.

As you explore it, you can come across clues, like a trail of blood, hidden journals with cryptic notations, a room with skeletons, that can help you piece together the story of what once happened there. And then, if you happen to find the deed to the property, which is hidden in the ruin, you can purchase the castle if you have the right currency (emeralds and other stuff).&nbsp;</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-591459276ecxAppleMailSignature\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;\"><br></span></div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-591459276ecxAppleMailSignature\"><font size=\"3\">I thought all of it was incredibly cool and showed a level of creativity I do not remember having at his age.

It seems like it is billed as an experiment into our increasing interest in/dependence on electronic devices and social media. But &quot;it&nbsp;was forbidden to&nbsp;communicate with others according to&nbsp;the rules of&nbsp;the experiment&quot; and that seems like a whole different experiment! That is in no way testing how teens respond to lack of technology, but lack of connection.
