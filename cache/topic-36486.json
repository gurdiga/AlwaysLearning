We&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen unschooling from the beginning, but I do have to admit that my idea of<br/>\nunschooling was tragically misguided for many years and I now feel that I&#39;m<br/>\ngetting on the right track - finally!  I&#39;ve been reading this list for some<br/>\ntime now and haven&#39;t really posted much of anything, but I really have<br/>\nlearned so much from you all and enjoy the list tremendously.  Thanks for<br/>\nall the goodies you all put out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I have found myself in the rut of the dirty house and exactly what<br/>\nneeded to be done about it.  When I don&#39;t slow down and enjoy the moment, I<br/>\nget all crazy and foaming at the mouth over the state of the house and<br/>\neventually turn really bitchy towards my kids.  Completely unnecessary and I<br/>\nhave known all along that it wasn&#39;t about the mess, per se, as it was my<br/>\nfeelings of discomfort with my surroundings and insecurity that what we&#39;re<br/>\ntrying to do is working.  Knowing this and needing some resources, I spent<br/>\nsome time this morning reading Sandra&#39;s page on chores (<br/>\nwww.sandradodd.com/chores) and it seemed to help.  However, for me, reading<br/>\nthe words and practicing the words are very different things and I wondered<br/>\nif I&#39;d be able to put this into practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the universe often works, not 20 minutes after I left the computer, I was<br/>\nconfronted with a pile of wooden and metal trains all over the floor right<br/>\nin front of my laundry room - it was almost as if they were inviting me to<br/>\nstep on them, slip, and break my neck.  In that moment, I had the choice to<br/>\na) call my kids down from their Wii game to come clean them up, b) do<br/>\nnothing and leave them there, or c) clean them up myself.  I chose C and did<br/>\nit with a smile.  In the 15 seconds that it took me to clean that mess up, I<br/>\nwas reminded of an incident not too long ago where I had a complete meltdown<br/>\nwith regards to the the toys in the basement.  At one point, I was literally<br/>\n*throwing* hot wheels at the cement floor and screaming at my kids.  It was<br/>\na full fledged typical 2 year old temper tantrum!!!  I&#39;m 32 years old and<br/>\nhere I was essentially flinging myself onto the floor, kicking and screaming<br/>\nand demanding my way!  Not my most shining moment.  After I remembered that<br/>\ntantrum, I also remembered that I was never ever &quot;allowed&quot; to have a tantrum<br/>\nas a kid.  All strong emotions were squashed.  I couldn&#39;t be angry, I<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be sad, I couldn&#39;t be scared, I couldn&#39;t feel worried, I couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbe confused.  I couldn&#39;t do anything other than &quot;get over&quot; myself and &quot;do<br/>\nsomething about it.&quot;  I was never allowed to feel or show anyone else that /<br/>\nwhat I was feeling.  But you know what I DID have to do?  Clean.  Always had<br/>\nto clean.  Every surface, every spot, every dish, every window, everything.<br/>\nNo wonder I have such issues about cleaning the house --I grew up being<br/>\nforced to clean other people&#39;s messes and my own things (which I never<br/>\nconsidered to be a mess, btw,) and never being allowed to have feelings<br/>\nabout it or anything else!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly I had such compassion for my younger self and a newfound compassion<br/>\nfor my children.  It took me 15 seconds to clean up that mess.  It would<br/>\nhave taken them at least 20 minutes when you add in all the time that would<br/>\nhave been spent arguing and forcing and manipulating.  Nothing at all would<br/>\nhave been gained from having them clean it up, but I gained huge insight by<br/>\ndoing it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nLive Well,<br/>\nSarah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36294,"nextTopicId":36573}}
