But then again, it could be &quot;under the surface&quot; so to speak. I will try to  <br/>\nwork on my thinking of candy being more part of the tribe, though. It could <br/>\nonly  help us all.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;there&#39;s a natural ebb and flow...&gt;<br/>\nThat is SO funny-I was just blogging a few days ago about the ebb and  flow <br/>\nof *my* journey through unschooling!! Though my terminology was more about  <br/>\n&quot;tides&quot;, but I like your terminology-it makes me think of the cute cartoon  <br/>\nshorts on Noggin with the little girl and her dog, Ebb and Flo. Connections.  Makes <br/>\nit seem like it was &quot;meant to be&quot;.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;Does he know cans=cash?&gt;<br/>\nI had forgotten about this, myself. We used to hoard cans for the cash when  <br/>\nwe were in leaner times. Funny, we&#39;d probably have had more cash if we&#39;d not  <br/>\nhave drunk so much pop. lol Thank goodness that was before we became parents.  <br/>\nWyl seemed really excited about it, but I wasn&#39;t sure about the price they <br/>\npay  nowadays (we curb recycle), but I&#39;ll be finding that out for sure tomorrow. <br/>\nI  don&#39;t think we have any of those machines that you can put the cans in for <br/>\ncash,  near here. I haven&#39;t seen any in many years.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~I&#39;m NOT comfortable with chemical sugar-substitute sweeteners,~~~<br/>\n&lt;I confess this is a *BIG* one with me!! We do read labels, definitely  as an<br/>\n&quot;informed consent&quot; not restriction. Hayden knows his dad had a brain  tumor.<br/>\nHayden knows dad&#39;s doctors told him *never* to have nutrasweet.  &gt;<br/>\nI read this part (among other parts) to Wyl and he would like to know more  <br/>\nof the story, like, &quot;Did he drink the nutrasweet?&quot;.
