I made a mental note as soon as I posted it.  I&#39;ve been reading US <br/>\ntesting and readiness things lately, and the general direction is toward <br/>\nstandardized testing at 3rd grade, but even so that isn&#39;t even true for all <br/>\nschools in the US, and even less true for other places around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of unschooling, kids aren&#39;t in grades, they are individuals learning <br/>\nall the time.  While some parents must keep track of grades and other data, <br/>\nhopefully they act as buffers for their children.  It&#39;s nice when I can forget <br/>\nwhat &quot;grade&quot; my child would be in.  It&#39;s happened many times over the years! <br/>\n Then I must go back and count it.  I&#39;m intentionally not counting back to see <br/>\nwhat grade Margaux would be in.  I lost track and that&#39;s okay by me!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the US, the trend to pull kids out of school seems to coincide with 3rd grade <br/>\nand the stress from testing.  It&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed over the years in general <br/>\nhomeschool forums, but that&#39;s not about unschooling, even if some of those <br/>\nfamilies come to unschool their kids.  It&#39;s those little reminders of school and <br/>\nliving in the absence of school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that&#39;s the hold over thinking in my own head from school, when grades are <br/>\nmentioned, I immediately go back to my own school experience, which is a US <br/>\nexperience and even though we didn&#39;t do rigorous testing until jr high school, <br/>\neven THAT is a construct of school that isn&#39;t universal!  Those are the bits <br/>\nthat always remain no matter how far I&#39;ve come in my thoughts that don&#39;t include <br/>\nschool or school thinking!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really does frame the way people think about ages and expectations and the <br/>\ncategories we put people in.  It&#39;s glaringly different for my own children. <br/>\n Especially noticeable in Chamille since she is older, that she really doesn&#39;t <br/>\nhave that in her thinking.  <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] public school?","postDate":"1292015178","msgId":58425,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNTEyMS45MDY1Mi5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDEubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltWDhjSGc5ckZGVmF6ZTJCTkQwQ08zQzUzKzkxRmJkVXdyTC0rQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlkanJ0Yis1dHMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUZDRTc0OTItOUU5My00N0M5LUI1NTctNzMyMUE3NDQ1NkYxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaW1YOGNIZzlyRkZWYXplMkJORDBDTzNDNTMrOTFGYmRVd3JMLStBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58424,"nextInTopic":58426,"prevInTime":58424,"nextInTime":58426,"topicId":58395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Public school also has comparisons, favouritisms, unhealthy peer pressures, much emphasis on grades and marks and unhealthy competition.*** My least","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1439316637\">***Public school also has comparisons, favouritisms, unhealthy peer pressures,<br/>\nmuch emphasis on grades and marks and unhealthy competition.***<br/>\n<br/>\nMy least favorite parts of school have to do with that sort of thing, that <br/>\ncombined with adult shaming and the general lack of respect towards children as <br/>\npeople.

Some dentists are more understanding <br/>\nand caring than others, but few, and I&#39;ve yet to meet one, really ever admit <br/>\nthat cavities can sometimes fix themselves and that sometimes it has little to <br/>\ndo with how one cares for their teeth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool can be like that too.

Sometimes it coincides <br/>\nwith a child&#39;s ability to understand the written word and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. <br/>\n In reality a 7 yr old has very little reason to need to be able to read and <br/>\nwrite.  If she wants to go to school, the school will give her reading readiness <br/>\nexercises and call it reading, when in actuality, she&#39;ll be copying and sounding <br/>\nout words, probably out of context, and doing worksheets with &quot;sounds like&quot; <br/>\npictures and other such nonsense that has little to do with actual reading. <br/>\n That&#39;s what schools call reading for those early years of school.

I don&#39;t mean I aced the grades. I had a wider very different world<br/>\nbecause of school, like an alternate life. For some kids, that&#39;s what school<br/>\nis. There are some good reasons for school, for kids whom school is not<br/>\ndoing such a number on, unbeknownst to them at the time perhaps. I thought I<br/>\nwas messing up school not to care about grades and so on. When I discovered<br/>\nunschooling I realized that my attitude actually made some sense. I got<br/>\nsomething worthy out of school even if I didn&#39;t enjoy it as much as I would<br/>\nhave liked to and I only realized some of this well after school was over<br/>\nwith. I also got more out of university once more freedom of choice came<br/>\ninto the picture (being of age as well as choice of courses, electives,<br/>\nprofessors, paper topics, majors, etc.). None of college was compulsory even<br/>\nif I were to lose money by dropping out. That&#39;s still a choice. (My parents<br/>\ndidn&#39;t send me. I went on my own though. I realize that isn&#39;t always the<br/>\ncase.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if not schooling were made compulsory by the absence of school? That<br/>\nmight not be such a good thing for unschooling were parents to tell their<br/>\nkids they can&#39;t have the school experience.

The first time, when she was 4, a few dance classes and a visit to the local Montessori preschool were enough to change her mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently, after in-depth conversation, it turned out that school looked attractive because she could ride in a vehicle without a car seat (school bus).  A trip to DC, where we rode in buses, taxis and the metro (all car seat-free) helped satisfy that desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] public school?","postDate":"1291738266","msgId":58404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFGQ0U3NDkyLTlFOTMtNDdDOS1CNTU3LTczMjFBNzQ0NTZGMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlkanJ0Yis1dHMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlkanJ0Yis1dHMxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58403,"nextInTopic":58405,"prevInTime":58403,"nextInTime":58405,"topicId":58395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Do you think public school might do any lasting harm? -=- If a thousand people said no it wouldn t, would that be a sure safety for her?

If you mean to her emotional state, maybe.  If you mean to her natural learning, yes; it can&#39;t help but do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool divides things into educational and non-educational, straight up.  Then it divides the educational things into language, math, science, history, health, physical education, music (if you&#39;re lucky) and art (as though it has no overlap with the other things).  Just learning those terms will do some harm to the purest possibilities of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she is six and has never been to school, maybe she wants to ride a bus, or have a teacher, or a lunch box, or to be around other kids.

Many of her friends are in school and her best homeschooled friend is going back next year.  I havnt told her that yet since it is still a while off and their plans may change.  It will be difficult for my daughter.  None of my boys want to go but she has asked about it. <br/>\nNot really sure what to do either.  She knows her alphabet but is not reading or writing much at all.  She isnt that motivated to do those things.  She would be in the 2nd grade next year and would be considered behind by school standards.  I guess I would worry that her feelings would be hurt or her self esteem.  At home these things wouldnt matter but at school attention would be drawn to them.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] public school?","postDate":"1291731202","msgId":58402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBNURGQzM3LUM3OEItNDY4Ni05MDVGLThFMzFFNzNGMTlBQUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM3NjA3MS44NTU0NC5xbUB3ZWIyNjcwOC5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDM3NjA3MS44NTU0NC5xbUB3ZWIyNjcwOC5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58401,"nextInTopic":58403,"prevInTime":58401,"nextInTime":58403,"topicId":58395,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
