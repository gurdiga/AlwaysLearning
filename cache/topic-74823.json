I want to stay home and do the Albuquerque gatherings every December, rather than try to do remote &quot;Always Learning Live&quot; events.  As long as this wonderful site is available to us at these rates, I should stay and invite people to come to see me here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlbuquerque is beautiful, and the site is less than two miles, straight shot from &quot;The A-1 Car Wash&quot; from Breaking Bad.  Seriously.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Octopus+Car+Wash,+Snow+Heights+Circle+Northeast,+Albuquerque,+NM/Ramada+Albuquerque+East,+10300+Hotel+Ave+NE,+Albuquerque,+NM+87123/@35.0969045,-106.538272,15z/data=!\">https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Octopus+Car+Wash,+Snow+Heights+Circle+Northeast,+Albuquerque,+NM/Ramada+Albuquerque+East,+10300+Hotel+Ave+NE,+Albuquerque,+NM+87123/@35.0969045,-106.538272,15z/data=!</a>3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x87220aa9cdcc8bfd:0x12c09a3885c2e7ed!2m2!1d-106.535112!2d35.108496!1m5!1m1!1s0x8718a077449640af:0x599562de0560c23e!2m2!1d-106.531266!2d35.085215<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are right off Eubank Blvd.   And Walt&#39;s house, if you&#39;re driving that far anyway, is just another mile or so, a few blocks off Eubank and Comanche.<br/>\n<br/>\n(End of Breaking Bad moment)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes to all of you whether you can come to hear me and some bright, happy unschoolers in Maine or New Mexico or not. :-)   Thanks for thinking about it, even for a moment here. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74782,"nextTopicId":74834}}
