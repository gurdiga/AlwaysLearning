The tree grew.  She still doesn&#39;t know what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back home: <br/>\nMarty is housesitting in a big house for a week.  I&#39;m guessing his girlfriend is helping him some.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly has a serious boyfriend, named Will.  I met him very briefly twice before I left, but they were not an item then.  In love, both of them. He&#39;s a guitarist in a band, but in some of the photos I&#39;ve seen he&#39;s playing bass.   Guitarists are good.  He&#39;s also very artistic, she says.  He&#39;s not at all tall.  He&#39;s Holly&#39;s size.  So they can share clothes. :-)  Good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby missed a promotion, but then has been given that position temporarily, partnered with someone else, so he&#39;ll have that much more experience (and they&#39;ll know how he actually can do) if another real position opens up.  But his hours are 5:30 pm to 3:30 am, so once again it looks like his sleep schedule WAS preparing him for future jobs. :-)  Also he and Erik his roommate and Erik&#39;s girlfriend moved to another house nearer to Blizzard&#39;s new facility (they were leasing before, on the far other side of Austin).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s shoulder is stronger than before the surgery.  There&#39;s always that frustrating time of early recovery when it&#39;s worse than just before, but he&#39;s passed the point.  He bought another used car to replace the Ford Taurus Holly was in when she was rearended.  He got a Toyota Prius, five or six years old.  I&#39;m looking forward to having my own van for my own self someday.  Holly&#39;s driving it, while I&#39;m gone, with its flying Hanuman hanging from the rearview mirror.  We&#39;ll share it, when I get back.  But she also has a boyfriend with a car.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is how my family is doing, because I&#39;m able to talk to them by phone from my computer with Skype, or with Holly, video chat on Skype.  THAT makes travelling less distant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in a street-facing second-story room in Derby, with a bowling club (bowls lawn?) outside the window, and a couple of guys have come and are playing.  That&#39;s cool.  I&#39;ve kept looking out there, like looking for birds.  They&#39;re there!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61293,"nextTopicId":61242}}
