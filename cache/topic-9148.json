Too late. Oh<br/>\nwell. Now DS4 (Roy, 8) puts his whole self on the<br/>\ntable. Drives DH batty. they both tip chairs back,<br/>\ntoo, until the joints come apart....then blame each<br/>\nother. Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen DS1 was 3 he would take everything out of the<br/>\ndrawers and shelves and fling it on the floor. I&#39;de<br/>\ncarefully put it all back when he was through. I put<br/>\nthe laundry away in the drawer and on the shelves.<br/>\nFinally I said &quot;Why do you keep doing this? Is it fun<br/>\nor do you just not like things to be on shelves and in<br/>\ndrawers?&quot;  The sweet little guy answered &quot;You are<br/>\nalways putting things away, I thought that was what<br/>\nYOU liked to do.....so I was giving you something to<br/>\ndo after everything was all put away.

I asked her &quot;did the modesty go away or is it just too <br/>\nhot to care&quot;  She giggled and said &quot;it&#39;s way too hot to care!&quot;  How <br/>\nwonderful that is.  She&#39;s asked to go to a nudest beach.  I may see if I <br/>\ncan find one for her.  Of course, I absolutely hate the beach and the <br/>\nsand, but if Lexie wants the experience, and asks again, I may find her <br/>\na nudest beach.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would quite worrying about your child and his facination <br/>\nwith his penis.  The more you give him attention for it the more he will <br/>\nwiggle it at you.  I&#39;d ignore it, completely, have it become a nonissue. <br/>\n because really it is.  Same with your daughter.  The only thing I have <br/>\never done with my girls is gently suggest if they are masterbating that <br/>\nthey need to go someplace more private.  But personally I think wiggling <br/>\nand comparing, etc. are all normal.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn some cultures children are naked until they are older.  Do you think <br/>\nthey wiggle it at people.  No probably they put clothes on to make their <br/>\nmoms crazy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:maryfhickman@...\">maryfhickman@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve been reading alot, learning alot, composing wonderous posts in my <br/>\n&gt; mind<br/>\n&gt; while I nurse toddler, non you all ever get to read.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We started public school with my oldest, her request, last week.
