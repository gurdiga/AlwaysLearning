I bet there is something driving her crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Sandra spoke for Kirby and said he meant he&#39;d had a good time, it <br/>\nwas a way of saying thank you to the hosts and an easing of a social <br/>\nsituation. If Kirby picked up from that on how to be more polite, then <br/>\nthat was just one little tiny piece of lots of ways he got that in his <br/>\nlife. But, if he was upset and being fussy, I doubt it really made much <br/>\nimpact.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m responding to the idea of it being used as a regular technique <br/>\nthroughout the day, day after day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve known a lot of parents who constantly did this kind of thing. <br/>\nThey&#39;re child says something, the parent repeats it but more politely or <br/>\nmore correctly.  Drives me crazy. In the cereal aisle in the store today <br/>\na dad and little boy, maybe 3 or 4. Child says, &quot;I want Rice Krispies,&quot; <br/>\nDad says, &quot;You want Rice Krispies, please.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  The most important is to create an environment in which she isn&#39;t <br/>\nangry - which means trying to figure out why she IS angry in the first <br/>\nplace. Happy and content little girls tend to be mostly kind and nice. <br/>\nWhat can you do to make her life better?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not, by the way, saying to ignore her rudeness. There are lots of <br/>\nother ways to respond to it, though. I&#39;m pretty direct - I&#39;d probably <br/>\nsay straight up, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t be rude,&quot; or &quot;No yelling,&quot; or &quot;You could <br/>\nhave asked a lot nicer.&quot; And I&#39;d have said to the other child, who, by <br/>\nthe way IS also being rude to get between someone and the tv that they <br/>\nare watching, &quot;Move out of the way,&quot; or &quot;Scootch over,&quot; or &quot;Come sit <br/>\nhere,&quot; or maybe even just, &quot;Pay attention to where you are.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy little sister used to get in front of the tv to annoy me. She&#39;d walk <br/>\nin super slow motion across in front ot it and when I&#39;d yell at her to <br/>\nmove she&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m JUST walking by.&quot; I&#39;d yell because I was angry that <br/>\nshe was doing this and getting away with something again.

Or the ones who refuse to hand them something and hold it inches out of reach and say &quot;use your words,&quot; &quot;what&#39;s the magic word?&quot;     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I think you probably need is to think more from your daughter&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; point of view. Ask yourself what SHE is probably thinking at the moment <br/>\n&gt; she&#39;s yelling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think she is probably using the only words she can come up with in that moment to express her feelings of frustration at the situation.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What did you think she would think when you repeated her request  for <br/>\n&gt; her sister to move, but more nicely?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Do you think she was thinking, &quot;Oh THAT&#39;s nicer, I should ask that way <br/>\n&gt; next time?&quot;  Really?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I was hoping that she would see that there is a way to get her needs met and express what she wanted AND be polite about it.  I was hoping that I was modeling how to go about doing that.  She&#39;s 4, so no, I didn&#39;t think that she would think about it in so many words.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anything, she was probably thinking, &quot;Mommy is making fun of me,&quot; or <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t get how in the way my little sister is,&quot; or &quot;Mommy <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t care that I&#39;m angry, she wants me to stifle it.&quot; (Okay - not in <br/>\n&gt; those words - in more raw and harsh words, probably.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t imagine why she would be thinking any of those things.  I didn&#39;t say it in a mocking voice.  I obviously understood how her little sister was in the way because I made her move.  I didn&#39;t say anything negative about her anger.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Read - &quot;How to Talk So Your Child will Listen and HOw to Listen So Your <br/>\n&gt; Child will Talk.&quot; It isn&#39;t the perfect book - but it might help you get <br/>\n&gt; a sense of what a child&#39;s internal response might be to typical <br/>\n&gt; parenting, as opposed to what you might be imagining or wishing the <br/>\n&gt; child&#39;s thoughts and feelings are.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have read it and it&#39;s been a long time, but I remember it being full of lots of scripts.  Those are helpful sometimes, but too often, for me, they can just get in the way of actually seeing my child and the situation and instead just falling back on the script.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dramatic","postDate":"1280357448","msgId":56452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1NDIzOS44OTkxMi5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTAubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJEQzA2OEI3LUIyNTgtNDc1NC1COUMwLTRCNDFEQzZDMTJBOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkycHA0dCs5ZDh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTMxMDEwLjgyOTQxLnFtQHdlYjExMDQwMi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxCREMwNjhCNy1CMjU4LTQ3NTQtQjlDMC00QjQxREM2QzEyQTlAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":56450,"nextInTopic":56453,"prevInTime":56451,"nextInTime":56453,"topicId":56393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Really?

That doesn&#39;t mean those kids<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t exist, just not in MY neighborhood apparently!  Margaux is learning how to<br/>\n&gt; be kind or at least walk away in the face of that sort of manipulation.  She<br/>\n&gt; feels it deeply, but sometimes it sidelines her and she gets angry without<br/>\n&gt; really being able to process WHY she is angry.  A good response that works well<br/>\n&gt; in lots of situations that evoke a strong emotional response without<br/>\n&gt; understanding why is &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot;, and then walking away until you can<br/>\n&gt; figure out why it is you don&#39;t like that.  Margaux usually ads, &quot;you&#39;re mean and<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want to play with you anymore!&quot;, which is a huge step better than what<br/>\n&gt; she used to do, &quot;You&#39;re f...ing rude and you&#39;re not my friend anymore, I hate<br/>\n&gt; you!&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Using the &quot;F&quot; word got Margaux banned from playing with some of those kids,<br/>\n&gt; which was a bit of a blessing in disguise.  A month or so later though, on her<br/>\n&gt; own volition, she went over and apologized for using curse words and had a<br/>\n&gt; lovely rationale behind her whole thought process!  She decided that since she&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; like to play with those kids SOMEtimes, then she should apologize, even if she<br/>\n&gt; felt like using curse words wasn&#39;t really a bad thing, and even IF what they<br/>\n&gt; were doing was far worse than using curse words.  Now when she slips up and uses<br/>\n&gt; a curse word, the kids&#39; immediate response is, &quot;you&#39;re going to hell, and I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; going to go tell on you!&quot;, to which Margaux says, &quot;fine, go tell, and maybe I&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; mention what you just did/said when your mom comes over, and by the way, you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t go to hell for saying curse words.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

That doesn&#39;t mean those kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t exist, just not in MY neighborhood apparently!  Margaux is learning how to <br/>\nbe kind or at least walk away in the face of that sort of manipulation.  She <br/>\nfeels it deeply, but sometimes it sidelines her and she gets angry without <br/>\nreally being able to process WHY she is angry.  A good response that works well <br/>\nin lots of situations that evoke a strong emotional response without <br/>\nunderstanding why is &quot;I don&#39;t like that!&quot;, and then walking away until you can <br/>\nfigure out why it is you don&#39;t like that.

She decided that since she&#39;d <br/>\nlike to play with those kids SOMEtimes, then she should apologize, even if she <br/>\nfelt like using curse words wasn&#39;t really a bad thing, and even IF what they <br/>\nwere doing was far worse than using curse words.  Now when she slips up and uses <br/>\na curse word, the kids&#39; immediate response is, &quot;you&#39;re going to hell, and I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to go tell on you!&quot;, to which Margaux says, &quot;fine, go tell, and maybe I&#39;ll <br/>\nmention what you just did/said when your mom comes over, and by the way, you <br/>\ndon&#39;t go to hell for saying curse words.&quot;<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dramatic","postDate":"1280340867","msgId":56433,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDNTA3MzgzLjUwNzAwMDFAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkycHA0dCs5ZDh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkycHA0dCs5ZDh2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56428,"nextInTopic":56435,"prevInTime":56432,"nextInTime":56434,"topicId":56393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Some polite<br/>\npeople can be cruel with it (or even rude with it) and that could in<br/>\nsome cases be considered a fine art. It&#39;s also a fine art to be rude<br/>\nyet kind with it. I just met a 70-something gal who is very<br/>\nrough-mannered and says things like &quot;shut-up&quot; but the twist is she<br/>\nisn&#39;t actually expecting anybody to shut up and is in fact encouraging<br/>\npeople to come out of their shells to join her in hilarity. She&#39;s<br/>\nincredibly sweetheartedly humorous as she invites people to join in<br/>\nand, as Glenda suggested about inviting her child to come swing if he<br/>\nwants to (but with a very different tone and feel), the water is fine.<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also possible to be polite AND kind but it might not even be a<br/>\ngood idea to be that way all the time, no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that&#39;s true about drama is that there&#39;s lots of power in it,<br/>\nand people are drawn to that. Most of it hasn&#39;t got much to do with<br/>\nkindness or peace, but there is that too as a possibility. A<br/>\nsuper-powerful combo. I&#39;ve seen it but haven&#39;t figured out how to pull<br/>\nit off.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s what your daughter is interested in. Or there might be<br/>\nsomething else going on. I think your idea of watching the patterns to<br/>\nsee if/when rudeness occurs or gets more intense (or whatever else you<br/>\nfind to look for in patterns) could be very helpful to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jul 27, 2010 at 12:25 PM, Emily S &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:saturnfire16@...\">saturnfire16@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; ===========<br/>\n&gt;&gt; &quot;It&#39;s really dramatic&quot; and &quot;dramatically getting quite upset&quot; are both phrases that, to me, are in the same vein as &quot;you&#39;re making a mountain out of a molehill&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re blowing this way out of proportion&quot;.

That response is about what *you&#39;re* feeling, not about what *she&#39;s* feeling.<br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; You could have poured her a HUGE glass of milk.

I am pointing this out because I have 4 girls ranging in age from 18 months to 9 years. They have all had periods where that have had really big emotional responses. It is perfectly normal for little kids to have big responses to things that adults perceive as something small. Have you ever had a day where something little irritates you and you react rudely? As an adult, I can usually , but not always, stuff those feelings down. I don&#39;t think it is realistic for a 4.5 year old to be able to suppress her frustrations and reword things in the moment. If you continue to model &quot;niceness&quot; and consideration, kids will pick up on it. It may not happen tomorrow but it will eventually catch on. <br/>\n<br/>\nNobody else in the world does for my children what I do. As the mom, I want my children to feel safe expressing all of their emotions whether it is rude or not. My kids have picked up on being nice versus being rude from seeing how I interact with their dad. They see it when we go to the grocery store and talk to the check out person. They see it in all of our interactions with the rest of the world. I don&#39;t feel the need to let them know when they are in the middle of a moment of frustration. We usually talk about it after we have been out and have had an encounter with somebody that was really nice or was really rude. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo you or me, not having the right amount of liquid in a cup may not seem like a big deal. To a little kid that doesn&#39;t have a lot of experience with the world, it can be a huge deal. Not only does she have to rely on you to get her a drink but she has to rely on you to get her the right amount. Then, if you get her the wrong amount and she speaks up, you get mad and tell her what to say and how to act. To you, it may seem like an occasional suggestion. To her, it may feel like you are nitpicking everything she says and does. There is a possibility that she feels like your constant suggestions are nitpicking. She may have picked up on the habit of nitpicking from you so her &quot;random drama&quot; could be her mirroring your behavior. I am not trying to pick on you. I am just trying to offer other possibilities. Whenever I find myself noticing something about my girls&#39; behavior, the first thing I do is check my own because I have a tendency to make small changes in my behavior or attitude and don&#39;t realize it until I see my girls mirroring it back to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Dramatic","postDate":"1280252443","msgId":56404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkybjVtcisxb2M4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkybjE5ZStxdnFhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56403,"nextInTopic":56405,"prevInTime":56403,"nextInTime":56405,"topicId":56393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s hard to see something from someone else&#39;s perspective if you have a negative slant to how you&#39;re viewing their actions and reactions. <br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nYou&#39;re right, they do sound negative.  Usually I think her dramatics are awesome and see her personality in a very positive light.  Until she&#39;s being rude to me.  And that&#39;s probably assigning negative intent too.  I know she&#39;s not *trying* to be rude, but that is the way it comes across.  <br/>\n<br/>\n===========<br/>\n&gt; When you make those type of suggestions, is she already doing something or are you making suggestions in response to her telling you she&#39;s bored or asking if you&#39;ll play with her?<br/>\n===============<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really seems like it can be ANY suggestion about anything.  Not that she does it EVERY time, but when she does it seems really random.  I will pay more attention though and see if I spot a pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n=============<br/>\n&gt; What I used to do with my son (sometimes still do) was to say, &quot;I&#39;m going out back to swing. When you get done with what you&#39;re doing or if you want to take a break, you&#39;re welcome to join me.&quot; Sometimes he just wasn&#39;t in a place where he could, or wanted to, give me a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer at that moment -- me going ahead and making the choice and then inviting him to join in if he wanted to gave him the chance to get there on his own terms.<br/>\n=============<br/>\n<br/>\nI do this and she still has the same reaction sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n==============<br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t handle it as an offer, just do it for her. Every morning after my son wakes up, I take a glass of water to his room. When I take him food to eat throughout the day, if his glass is empty or nearly empty, I&#39;ll take it and fill it up for him. <br/>\n=================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, this is what I meant when I said offer.  I physically have it in my hands and am giving it to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=============<br/>\n&gt; ===I am left completely puzzled and tell her &quot;No thank you works just fine.===<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I&#39;m feeling unhappy or irritable, the last thing I want is someone telling me to not be cranky or rude!<br/>\n===================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYah, I get that.  I feel the same way.  I want to give her words to say that are more appropriate (not make her say them, but just make her aware of them) and I don&#39;t really know how to do that in a kind, helpful way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=====================<br/>\n&gt; ===When I handed her the cup she threw herself on the floor and yelled &quot;That&#39;s not enough!&quot;  Um, ok....... how about mom can you please pour me some more?===<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is that how you responded to her, &quot;how about, mom can you please pour me some more?&quot;??? That response is about what *you&#39;re* feeling, not about what *she&#39;s* feeling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You could have poured her a HUGE glass of milk. You could have poured her two glasses of milk. You could have asked her if she would like to help you pour the milk so she could show you the amount she&#39;d like. All of those things could have been done nicely and cheerfully.<br/>\n=======================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that is how I responded.  She got up and repeated it after me and I did cheerfully continue to pour until she said stop.  I will be honest and say that the times that she continues to act like that after I have suggested more appropriate wording, I don&#39;t act cheerful back.  I get irritated.  On one hand, I understand how it might be helpful to continue to do things cheerfully and kindly no matter how she is acting.  I realize that I shouldn&#39;t let her mood dictate my response.  On the other hand, no one else in the world is probably going to do that for her.  How do I let her know that when she is rude when someone is helping her, people are going to be far less inclined to continue to help her, without being rude and mean myself?  <br/>\n<br/>\n==================<br/>\n&gt; Take the focus off how she &quot;should&quot; act, so that it&#39;ll be easier to focus on if there&#39;s something else going on. If it&#39;s something more than being tired or hungry (easily fixed!), you&#39;ll have a better chance of figuring out what it is if you&#39;re not thinking in terms of &quot;dramatic&quot; or &quot;not polite&quot;.<br/>\n==================<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, that&#39;s just the reminder I needed!  When she does things like that, it just triggers this instant reaction in me and at that moment I&#39;m not thinking one bit about *why* she is acting that way.  I will try to keep that in mind today and see how things go!<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Dramatic","postDate":"1280247315","msgId":56397,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM1Q0EzRDUzLTkwNDUtNDg1MS1BRTc3LTY0NTk0Q0MyQjEwRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkybTZmMSttbTJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkybTZmMSttbTJ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56394,"nextInTopic":56400,"prevInTime":56396,"nextInTime":56398,"topicId":56393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-===When I handed her the cup she threw herself on the floor and yelled That s not enough!
