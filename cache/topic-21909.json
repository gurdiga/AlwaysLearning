It is called the Paradise Point Hotel and all my<br/>\ndaughter I and could think that this would make a great place<br/>\nto hold a conference!  Its an all inclusive kind of place<br/>\nwith lush vegetation, five pools, ponds everywhere throughout,<br/>\nsand volleyball court, basketball, right on the beach in<br/>\nMission Bay, bike and skate rentals, putting range and free<br/>\ncroquet, mini market, boat rentals etc.  It was just so<br/>\nneat. But what I thought was incredible was how many<br/>\nfamilies I saw there! I have four kids, one is a toddler<br/>\nwho is very mobile and never content to sit for long.<br/>\nIt was very cool to me that these families had all these<br/>\nyoung kids and mine wasn&#39;t the only one getting into stuff<br/>\n(ok so mine was the only one wandering around ) but other<br/>\nkids were spilling there water etc!  They do have a<br/>\nconference center and I don&#39;t know what the rates are.<br/>\nThe regular rates are $159 but the conference rate<br/>\nmight be much better. This by the way puts you right on<br/>\nthe beach for that price. The suites are much more<br/>\nepensive.  Anyhow I just had to mention this place and<br/>\nto share with anyone who might visit San Diego to check<br/>\nthis place out!  www.paradisepoint.com<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Genant2@...\">Genant2@...</a> [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Genant2@...\">Genant2@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Tuesday, March 29, 2005 9:30 AM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingbasics@yahoogroups.com</a>;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:UnschoolingDiscussions@yahoogroups.com\">UnschoolingDiscussions@yahoogroups.com</a>; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:NCUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com\">NCUnschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Live and Learn Conference<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi everyone,<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget that registration for the October Live and Learn Unschooling<br/>\nConference in St. Louis, MO is open.
