I really enjoy <br/>\nreading them!  What prompted Dylan to cut his hair?<br/>\n  <br/>\nWe&#39;ve been planting strawberries, sunflowers and herbs (that&#39;s <br/>\npronounced &#39;h&#39;erbs, because it&#39;s got a fucking H in it  -  courtesy <br/>\nof Eddie Izzard &lt;g&gt;) the last few days.  We keep unearthing the <br/>\nsquirrels forgotten acorn stores.  We also found a dead mole at <br/>\nthe entrance to his hole, I think a cat got him.  <br/>\nWe&#39;re going to have a picnic today but it&#39;s very overcast, a bit <br/>\nwindy, and looks like rain.  We&#39;ll either picnic in the rain, or if it <br/>\ngets really bad, we&#39;ll come back here and picnic on the front <br/>\nporch.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve just finished building an island with a volcano on it for <br/>\nTamzin&#39;s dinosaurs.  We&#39;re going to erupt the volcano in a <br/>\ncouple of days (when the papier mache and varnish is dry).  She <br/>\nwants to make sure the lava flows over some of the dinos so <br/>\nthey can get fossilized &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\nWe got a pair of $2.00 roller skates (almost new!) at a garage <br/>\nsale on Friday and she&#39;s been skating around the house and up <br/>\nand down the front porch since then.  She tried skating on the <br/>\nback patio, but Angel (one of our dogs) was too intent on chasing <br/>\nafter her &lt;g&gt;.  I think I&#39;ll take her to an empty parking lot or <br/>\nsomewhere else to skate today as well as the picnic.<br/>\nI&#39;ve started a cleaning business!  It&#39;s called Natural Enviroment <br/>\nCleaning Service.  I only use natural products, most of which I <br/>\nmake myself.  If anyone has any recipes for citrus based natural <br/>\ncleaners I&#39;d appreciate if you could pass them onto me, I&#39;ve yet to <br/>\nfind a citrus based formula that I like.

We got a flat tire and Dylan learned <br/>\nhow to<br/>\n&gt; use the jack.  We ate lunch on a big rock and looked up to find <br/>\nthree<br/>\n&gt; white tail deer investigating us.  <br/>\n&gt; We startled a Red Tailed hawk and found the Crow he was <br/>\ndevouring.  He<br/>\n&gt; had removed it&#39;s head and the feathers on its breast and already <br/>\neaten<br/>\n&gt; much of the innards.

We<br/>\n&gt; watched a Killdeer running on the mud flats of an old dredge pond,<br/>\n&gt; darting around catching bugs and talked about how they will act <br/>\nwounded,<br/>\n&gt; and try to lure you away if you come too close to a nest.

A <br/>\nStarling<br/>\n&gt; crept through the vent in our attic and was roaming around under <br/>\nthe eve<br/>\n&gt; of our roof, inside the siding.
