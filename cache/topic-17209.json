I love animals and so do the kids,  but I have dog<br/>\nallergies and my ds does too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know,  stupid to get one,  but we saw her at the human society&#39;s adopt<br/>\nclinic and we were going to keep it outside, heated garage,  blah, blah,<br/>\nblah.   Well,  I/we couldn&#39;t keep her out there,  she looked lonely,  so<br/>\nshe&#39;s in the house now.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe love her to death,  kids have been so happy with her.   But my allergies<br/>\nare kicking in and so are my ds and even dh&#39;s, I think, (we didn&#39;t know he<br/>\nwas allergic to dogs)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of you use homeopathic remedies for this,  on a continual basis?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI picked up Animal Hair and Dander Refief from a Natural Food place.  Seems<br/>\nto kind-of work.  Little scared to use it with my son,  did give him a small<br/>\ndose.    There was some warning about asthma sufferers and he and I have a<br/>\ntouch of asthma.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma, if you don&#39;t mind,  could I e-mail you off list too?<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Lots of experience with ankle and other injuries here.

A month or so ago she dislocated her shoulder.  Last week she<br/>\n&gt; had a huge swollen bruise on her thigh.
