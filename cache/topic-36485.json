This might take the &#39;waste&#39; irritation from your brain.  Hey, <br/>\nand hubby will be very happy that something is all ready for his taking. <br/>\nDave LOVES when I have items ready in the fridge.  Ohhhhh, and kiddo can <br/>\nthen grab said piece of sandwich as wishes also.  Hmmm, win/win and win!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;-=-What is one more glass? -=-&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorscha used to be a glass maniac.  We came up with a few solutions that <br/>\nworked for both of us.  She keeps a glass at the kitchen sink (she&#39;ll run in <br/>\nand grab a drink) and also in the bathroom.  Then she also keeps a giant <br/>\ntumbler with no spill lid at her computer area / family room.  I will clean <br/>\nit and refill everyday.  As for glasses outside, we have a cabana with a <br/>\nfridge full of drinks.  I keep water bottles in there and have a trashcan in <br/>\nthe area.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorscha and I are quite opposite in our lifeways.  I&#39;ve tried to come up <br/>\nwith solutions that work for both of us instead of being &#39;BitchMom&#39;. I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant &#39;BM to be my legacy.   Sorscha is a snacker (maybe your kiddo is also). <br/>\nShe rarely eats what I would consider a meal.  I&#39;ve found that if I keep <br/>\neasy, small &#39;foods&#39; on hand for her, then she&#39;ll just grab and go.  Sooo, <br/>\nthe fridge is full of precut veggies and fruits.  It&#39;s also filled with easy <br/>\ngrab lunchable type things (you can make these yourself or purchase).  The <br/>\npantry is filled with &#39;grab&#39; containers with lids. Now that she&#39;s older I <br/>\nhave EasyMac and other quickie hot options available (she&#39;s not into using <br/>\nthe stove at this point so they need to be microwave ready).  About 1/2 the <br/>\ntime she prefers me to gather her food and bring it to her (it&#39;s because she <br/>\nloves me) and the other 1/2 she grabs herself.  I also keep trashcans in <br/>\nseveral rooms.  This helps the trash get to where it needs to go and not on <br/>\nthe floor.  Win/Win again.  Hey, and often times I will come into the family <br/>\nroom area and just pick up the wrappers, etc. that don&#39;t make it in the <br/>\ntrash but since THERE IS a trashbag in here it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, the goal is finding solutions and not &#39;bitch&#39; opportunities.  The <br/>\nother day I came home to find a huge mess from the contractor and the <br/>\nneighbor&#39;s irrigation ditch (that flows through our yard) had overflowed by <br/>\nabout 25 feet into the chicken coop and Sorscha&#39;s sandbox.  I was like a <br/>\ntwo-year-old (I was already tired and hungry from a long day) and I began to <br/>\ncry being overwhelmed and all.  Fortunately Dave was pulling in the driveway <br/>\nand saved the day.  Husbands&#39; rock! Later in the evening when Sorscha and I <br/>\nwere hanging for bed I said, &quot;Sorry I was a wienie today.&quot;  Sorscha said, <br/>\n&quot;Your not a penis Mom, your a vagina.&quot;  I just thought that was funny and <br/>\nthat I would share.
