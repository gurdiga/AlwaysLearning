He HAS to figure those out for himself.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo you let him figure them out for himself?  Not totally.   Probably you&#39;ll <br/>\nhelp him by propping things behind him when he&#39;s first learning  to sit up, or <br/>\nclearing a space for him or making things easily available for him  to play <br/>\nwith when he can first sit up but can&#39;t crawl yet.  And walking  needs things to <br/>\npull up on, and encouragment, and maybe he&#39;d like to hold your  finger and <br/>\npull up or walk from the couch two or three steps to your  hands.  That&#39;s not <br/>\nshowing him how, it&#39;s helping him when HE wants to do  it.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you show him that a toy comes apart, that&#39;s like pee-a-boo.  He  might be <br/>\nmonths from doing it himself, but he&#39;ll probably have fun watching you  pull <br/>\nsomething out and put it back in.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt won&#39;t ruin his discovery for you to show him how things work, or to talk  <br/>\nwhile you&#39;re doing things so he&#39;ll start to see how they go, like talking <br/>\nabout  buckling the carseat, that there are two buckles; or saying you&#39;re screwing <br/>\nthe  lid on a cup so it won&#39;t spill.  That&#39;s conversation, and will help him  <br/>\nunderstand how and why, and to pick up terminology.  Just carry him around,  <br/>\ntalk to him, and give him the opportunity to see, touch, taste, smell and hear <br/>\n lots and lots of things.<br/>\n <br/>\n-=- For <br/>\ninstance, I recently taught him how to turn the light switch on  and <br/>\noff - I tried letting him just play with the switch as would seem to  <br/>\nbe the best way per Holt, but he didn&#39;t have any interest until I <br/>\nshowed  him how it works. -=-<br/>\n <br/>\nThe most you could have done is to turn the light on and off and point at  it <br/>\nand talk about the switch, and maybe help him turn it on and off and say  <br/>\n&quot;Cool!&quot; or whatever.

I bought crayons for my son (based on a story from a <br/>\nGWS article that was mentioned in &#39;How Children Learn&#39;) about a <br/>\nmonth ago and have given them to him to play with about once a week <br/>\nto see if he was &quot;ready&quot;.  Each time, he would just put the crayons <br/>\nin his mouth.  Then, yesterday, I realized that the only thing that <br/>\nworried me about this was the paper around the crayons, so I took <br/>\noff the paper and gave him the wax crayons and sat him in my lap <br/>\nwith a big pad of paper and then just watched.  Initially, he was <br/>\ninterested only in sucking on the crayons.  But as his arms moved <br/>\naround with the crayons in his hands, he noticed that he was making <br/>\nmarks on the paper.  Then he started focusing on his drawing instead <br/>\nof sucking and even worked on adjusting the crayon in his hand to <br/>\nmake it easier to draw!

My husband (who read &#39;How <br/>\n&gt; Children Learn&#39;) and I are having a hard time figuring out how <br/>\nbest <br/>\n&gt; to apply Holt&#39;s theories to our infant.  Since a 6 month old has <br/>\n&gt; such a limited understanding of the world, I am torn between <br/>\nshowing <br/>\n&gt; him how to do things and letting him figure everything out for <br/>\n&gt; himself (I&#39;m afraid that at this age children might need more <br/>\n&gt; guidance than at the toddler age, but I really don&#39;t know).

Its too the extreme in<br/>\nsome cases for some, but good food for thought.  Right now<br/>\nyou can just love your baby and respond to his needs. Its<br/>\nall so natural : ) I don&#39;t think you need to show him<br/>\nanything artificially. In my experience, they all figure<br/>\nout that turning the light switch on and off as soon<br/>\nas they can reach it is a blast LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of Emily<br/>\nSent: Saturday, May 07, 2005 8:56 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] John Holt for Infants?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am new to this group - I feel very strongly that I would like to <br/>\nincorporate Holt&#39;s views on learning into my own upbringing of my DS <br/>\n(6 mos).
