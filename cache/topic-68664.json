Sometimes that seems strange to me when I read about people doing things in the kitchen with kids, or her friends come over and are all excited to help make cookies or stir the powder into the mac-n-cheese. But Ray (in our pre-unschooling days) was coaxed and bullied into the kitchen and by the time he left school didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with cooking. He learned to make things in the microwave first because those &quot;didn&#39;t count&quot; and were fun things like jello and coco and ramen noodles - previously blacklisted foods. Now he does all his own cooking. Mo doesn&#39;t have Ray&#39;s baggage. Whether she learns to cook or not, she&#39;ll never have to go through that stage of feeling like some foods or cooking methods are bad and shameful. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut another angle on that question is that sometimes parents worry about certain things because their ideas about learning still look like school subjects - math is the most obvious example because so many people who went through school have lost sight of what &quot;math&quot; really is. So a kid playing video games, or programming, or creating a treasure map, or playing with legos won&#39;t &quot;look like math&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; My assumption is that they are subjects that are taught in schools; history or geometry or a foreign language or maybe earth science. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are more good examples of learning not looking like school. An interest in dinosaurs, for interest, will naturally lead kids into history and earth science, and touch on some foreign language, too. And you won&#39;t get far into earth science or fitting bones together without running into some geometry. And while you&#39;re playing around with geometry you&#39;ll run into more foreign language and history. But none of that learning will look like worksheets or pop quizzes and it will swirl around into and out of other interests and themes. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause the focus of schools is on providing a &quot;well rounded education&quot; parents sometimes worry about &quot;gaps&quot; - but there are plenty of gaps in what kids learn in schools, and plenty of the &quot;material&quot; which gets &quot;covered&quot; is forgotten so quickly it might as well never have been learned at all. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Passions","postDate":"1345383995","msgId":68669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk3QjZGQkE4LUVCN0MtNEY5OC04RkQwLTMyNEVEOURDNzNBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZGM0VBMkZELTVFREQtNEJEQS05RDVBLThFRDE4ODUzMUI4M0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGswcW5vcSs0dWZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NkYzRUEyRkQtNUVERC00QkRBLTlENUEtOEVEMTg4NTMxQjgzQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":68668,"nextInTopic":68680,"prevInTime":68668,"nextInTime":68670,"topicId":68664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-If a parent can t replace her idea that learning is accumulating facts with the idea of learning is growing understanding from experience then unschooling","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1739329925\">-=-If a parent can&#39;t replace her idea that learning is accumulating facts with the idea of learning is growing understanding from experience then unschooling will be scary and frustrating.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote that, and she&#39;s right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if a parent who can&#39;t replace her ideas tries, anyway, to unschool, then that poor child might find unschooling to be scary and frustrating, as her mom goes back and forth between pretending and attempting to give her child options, and then taking them away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Passions","postDate":"1345383905","msgId":68668,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4MUUzMjE5LTI1RkUtNDE0MC05NzM2LTQ2OUY4MkYyNUNBREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGswcW5vcSs0dWZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGswcW5vcSs0dWZyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68665,"nextInTopic":68669,"prevInTime":68667,"nextInTime":68669,"topicId":68664,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What about when your child s passions don t include certain things? -=- No one s passion includes everything, and not everyone has passion. :-) Some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-180936288\">-=-What about when your child&#39;s passions don&#39;t include certain things? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one&#39;s &quot;passion&quot; includes everything, and not everyone has passion. :-)<br/>\nSome people have casual interest, at most.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t be said if your child isn&#39;t passionate about pine cones or Matchbook cars or music.
