It helps to get creative in thinking about what kind of work you can do, and deliberately look for work with odd hours. Three twelve hour shifts, for instance, give you almost full-time and four days off with your kids. Or look for a place where you can go to work early and be home by 3 or 4  - if your kids are night owls, you&#39;ll be home for their &quot;breakfast&quot; and still awake for &quot;lunch&quot;. I used to work four ten hour days, starting early so I was home by 3 - that was nice, we had most of the afternoon to do fun things, and one week-day to avoid the crowds, and now and then I&#39;d take a half day and be home by noon. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd don&#39;t jump right to full time if you don&#39;t have to - part time often gives you more flexibility in all sorts of ways, including the ability to go out of town or take off when it&#39;s convenient to you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSee anything you do as a short term, for-now solution, something you&#39;re trying out, not &quot;for keeps&quot;. It might be better, if you&#39;re reasonably certain of child support, to stay home for now and wait and see. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd do Everything In Your Power to keep things amicable with your soon-to-be Ex - to the point of not trash talking him to anyone, not arguing about things which aren&#39;t dire necessities. In the divorce game, the biggest asshole wins every time - to the detriment of the kids. Every Time. So don&#39;t be the biggest asshole and do what you can to keep any kind of assholery from escalating. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I will be building a home-based business over the next couple of years (though doing that while working full-time will mean even less time for the boys)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think there are enough hours in the week to work full-time, build a business full time and homeschool full time.

You don&#39;t need to get down and dirty with the finances -- you don&#39;t want them worrying. That&#39;s your job :-) But include them in problem solving and brainstorming several ideas of ways to tackle what comes up and what&#39;s most likely to come up. Empower them. Worse than staying home alone is not being able to decide. When people have the choice, they can put up with some very unideal situations. But forced into a situation, even minor inconveniences loom huge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;m assuming the divorce wasn&#39;t their decision, they&#39;re going to be angry and resentful -- which may not look like adult anger and resentment.
