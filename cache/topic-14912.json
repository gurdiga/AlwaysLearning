(pony pen pals, of\r<br/>\ncourse)  She has four of them right now and just sent for 2 more.  She\r<br/>\nalways looks forward to their letters and she is pretty prompt about writing\r<br/>\nback.  She has almost always written her letters on the computer and printed\r<br/>\nthem out because she didn&#39;t feel like her hand writing was neat enough to be\r<br/>\nlegible.  (and sometimes it wasn&#39;t)   Quite often her pen pals write back to\r<br/>\nher in long hand and she has noticed how neat some of them write.  I think\r<br/>\nit inspired her to try harder to write neatly.  This last batch of pen pal\r<br/>\nletters that she sent out were all written in long hand and they were not\r<br/>\nonly neat, but she actually used capital and lowercase letters\r<br/>\nappropriately.  Since she began writing, she&#39;s used almost exclusively\r<br/>\ncapital letters when writing in long hand.  She just found it easier than\r<br/>\nprinting lower case letters.  When writing on the computer she has always\r<br/>\nused both lower case and upper case letters.  I was pleasantly surprised at\r<br/>\njust how lovely her letters were.  The punctuation was right on too, except\r<br/>\nin one or two places.  It never ceases to amaze me to see how things all\r<br/>\ncome together when the kids have a purpose for something and they are ready\r<br/>\nfor it.\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nAngela\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\n \r<br/>\nYahoo!
