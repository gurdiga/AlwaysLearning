Harry Potter Pajama party. From 9pm to 1am on a<br/>\nFriday night they will be screening Prisoner of Azkaban and then<br/>\nreading aloud chapter 1 of Half Blood Prince.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lurker, and a new one at that I am thoroughly enjoying this list.  <br/>\nHarry Potter is one of our favorites and we will be celebrating on <br/>\n7/15.  To look up a Potter Party near you find www.potterparties.com.  <br/>\nWe are going to our local B&N for it&#39;s party and the release but are <br/>\nusing some of the tips from this site to plan our own day-long <br/>\nevent.    <br/>\nHarry took our house by storm last year.  I read all 5 to my then 6 yo <br/>\nnon-reader and within a year he began reading them himself.  He is now <br/>\non the fifth himself and wants to finish before the HBP is released.  <br/>\nBYW We have all the &quot;warning&quot; relatives as well.  Of course none of <br/>\nthem have read a page which I am sure would change them since JK <br/>\nRowling is just Brilliant, IMO.<br/>\n  <br/>\nJenn in VA</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22480,"nextTopicId":22452}}
