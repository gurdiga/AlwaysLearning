(There were others who were there <br/>\nlearning in Alternative alternative ways, but they eventually left because <br/>\ntheir parents figured they could do that somewhere else, cheaper.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter graduation, I signed up to do alum admissions interviews. They only <br/>\nrequired interviews in iffy situations, and one required interviiew I got was <br/>\nfrom a very straight-laced kid who had a 4.0, Eagle Scout, high SATs, wanting <br/>\nto major in Computer Science,  etc...all the things most colleges lust after <br/>\nin a potential student.<br/>\n<br/>\nHampshire needed to know...Why us?
