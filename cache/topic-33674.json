I&#39;ve taken brooms and mops and cut the handles down so they are more child sized - if the handles are metal I wrap the cut end with duct tape to cover the sharp metal. - well actually Ed (dad) cuts them down and wraps them in duct tape. If legos are everywhere we take a small child sized snow shovel to scoop them into tubs.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Zac (who is 13 now) started cutting vegetables and fruit with a sharp knife at age 3 - yes with mom or dad there with him.  Oh and cutting bread and toast - spreading things with a knife too.  We did not hover over him, we were simply in the kitchen with him doing our own thing - <br/>\n<br/>\n  My niece is 7 and my nephews are 6 and 2 - all 3 love to come to my house and clean.  What usually statrs it for them is my cleaning - If I vaccuum then all of a sudden there they are asking to vaccuum.  They may not clean the way I would - they may miss spots - but they are happy to let me point out spots - like &quot;There is a bit of _____ . Can you get it?&quot; They will most often happily get it.  If not, OK,  I make a mental note to go back over it later or pick it up by hand, or just let it be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  AND the one thing I&#39;ve learned to let go of is a neat - spick and span house - even with only one child our house has pretty much been a creative mess for the past 11 years. Richt now the family room is ankle deep in legos.  He seems to be his most creative when sitting in the middle of a mess.  If I required him to clean up each day he woul be very frustrated.  Some of his best creations, lego and other mediums, are a work in progress - he will make something and then change or add onto it for days and weeks.  He does know that if we are expecting company or he has ceased to be creative with something for several days then we will clean - that we will work out a way to preserve his creations while cleaning up the other pieces not in current use.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Lisa W.<br/>\n  . <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":156312427,"authorName":"Shannon Foust","from":"Shannon Foust &lt;soldout641@...&gt;","profile":"soldout641","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: son calling me names","postDate":"1206672556","msgId":33758,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxMDE1MS4yNjA5Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MDMxMC5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDFGQTQ5RTNCLTIyMzQtNDY1Qi1BQkVBLURBNDIyNTA0MUREQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33730,"nextInTopic":33853,"prevInTime":33757,"nextInTime":33759,"topicId":33674,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Make your life better than school, or put the kids in school.

I usually say<br/>\nsomething along the lines of &quot;that&#39;s not cool, I can see that you are<br/>\nreally angry and if you&#39;d like me to help you I can, but you need to be<br/>\nkind towards me.&quot;  I can say that knowing that I &quot;am&quot; kind to her and<br/>\nshe knows it, she is angry because of circumstances.<br/>\n=============<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to spin a little bit more onto this. One of the things that helps Linnaea when she gets angry is for me to ask her about her needs. Today Simon and Linnaea were playing with beyblades and she got hurt by a beyblade Simon had spun into her. It was an accident, but one that could have been predicted by the way they were playing. I suggested that if they gave a warning about when they were firing off the beyblade it might help to avoid such accidents. So she and Simon tried to come up with calls they could give and were working on the timing of the calls. They decided that clear was a good call for when they were retrieving their beyblade. It was the one the archers we&#39;d seen a week or so ago used when they would walk down to retrieve their arrows. I said that maybe it would be better for the responsibility to lie in the person shooting the beyblade and not the person retrieving the beyblade. Linnaea got mad. It wasn&#39;t something that &quot;should have&quot;<br/>\n irritated her. Or that wouldn&#39;t irritate her if she wasn&#39;t hungry, or tired, or sick, or something other than focusing on beyblades. She was angry because of where she was. I offered her food and she looked at me, angry because she was angry, and then she breathed, visibly made space for the possibility that it wasn&#39;t the beyblades that were the problem, and she snarled &quot;I&#39;m starving&quot;. So I got her food and it helped. I think it also helped for her to have that possiblility to think about. But really what helps are all the conversations that have gone on before today. When I get hungry, I tend toward crabby. So I try and eat when I&#39;m hungry. I&#39;ve had spoken moments expressing frustration linked to hunger. Those things help. Simon is really good at this. He knows that if he is tired he can&#39;t cope with many things. So he naps. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to have a lot of back story to fill in the information. It helps if your child, as Jenny&#39;s daughter, knows that you are kind and that you aren&#39;t trying to sabotage them, or deny the validity of their anger. If David tells me that I might be acting premenstrual it doesn&#39;t make me angry, but with other people in my life it could make me feel hurt or sensitive. But I trust him. I trust that he has my interests in mind when he tells me that I might be acting with a bit of hormonal bias. And it helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: son calling me names","postDate":"1206645442","msgId":33716,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZzZ3JzMitib2k3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZzZzZzMit1aThhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":33715,"nextInTopic":33721,"prevInTime":33715,"nextInTime":33717,"topicId":33674,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They got interested in where the TMNT&#39;s got their <br/>\nnames and we did research (one night!) online and found out about <br/>\nLeonardo di Vinci and Michealangelo.  We found pictures from the Sisine <br/>\nChapel and the famous Mona Lisa.  This lead to checking out books at <br/>\nthe library on these artists and both children finding Mona Lisa&#39;s <br/>\neverywhere even on birthday cards!

Let me tell you a little story . Yesterday Linnaea had a friend over, whenever this friend is over there is","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1474131642\">That is a long list of possible problems. Let me tell you a little story &lt;BWG&gt;. Yesterday Linnaea had a friend over, whenever this friend is over there is usually a huge creative mess that explodes over one room or the other. Last week they made flour art, I redirected them from the bottom of the stairs to the sunroom, which is much easier to clean and much less likely to get tracked through the rest of the house. It would have been easy to get angry and to stop it all together with resentment on all sides, but flour is a pretty cool medium and I found some dark paper that they could &quot;draw&quot; on and they had a blast creating temporary art. Often their art has water involved, and toilet paper. They love creating homes for their Littlest Petshop pets that include water and toilet paper. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, that isn&#39;t my story, that is just the background piece to demonstrate the mess potential. My story is about me and choosing in a moment what I wanted to do with my emotions. Linnaea and her friend had been up in her bedroom for ages, quietly and not so quietly playing. They were having a blast, telling stories with the toys that I&#39;ve managed to unpack (quite a few toys) and playing on her bed. I&#39;d asked her to go sparingly on the toilet paper as we were down to the last roll (or 2) and with the runny nose she was suffering from, well we needed all the toilet paper we had at that moment. I was downstairs unpacking a box or two with Simon trying to find the beyblades he wanted and found a couple of dolls to bring upstairs. When I got there I found that all the stuffed animals, all the dolls, everything had been pulled off the shelves and scattered onto the floor. She has a lot of stuffed animals. It was a big pile of mess. And my first reaction was<br/>\n anger. I was mad that all the work I&#39;d done to put those animals on the shelf had been wiped away in whatever amount of time it had taken for these two little girls to take them all of the shelf. But I didn&#39;t express that emotion. I went downstairs and I sought out David and I talked out how I was feeling with him. And I said &quot;I don&#39;t have to clean it up.&quot; and I said &quot;It isn&#39;t even my room.&quot; and I breathed and I let it go. Today I went upstairs to vacuum and to put clothes away. When I went into her room to put some clothes in I looked around at the stuffed toy apocolypse and realized it was pretty cool. There were stories all over the place. There was a gorilla with a puppy sitting together in the closet which reminded me of Koko the gorilla and her kitten which resulted in me looking on-line for images of Koko with All Ball and having a conversation about sign language and gorillas. There were moments all over her room that told of how their stories<br/>\n were woven. And it was my pleasure to go through and pick up the toys and put them away so that the next time she and her friend get together they have a clean slate. I got to chose how I approached that mess, that tension, that horrible room. And by breathing and thinking and choosing I got to have that moment where I found the gorilla and the puppy and have it become Koko and her kitten. And now I know Koko is moving, again. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother story from yesterday. I was tired and ready to go to bed. Linnaea had discovered Daredevil was on and she offered it to Simon. Simon got excited and sat down to watch it. Linnaea wanted to watch with him. I wanted to go to bed. So, I went upstairs to get ready. And while up there I was thinking about how scary Daredevil might be for Linnaea and that I would just be lying in bed waiting for her to come and join me and that I could do that kind of relaxing with her sitting on my lap just as easily as up in bed. So I got my pajamas on and went back downstairs and we watched for a few minutes and then they both decided that they didn&#39;t want to watch the whole thing. But she was so pleased that I had come down to join her. She beamed at me. That was worth a lot of feeling sleepy. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are nervous about him being alone with scissors could you set up a nest for yourself in the living room so that you can nod off a bit while he creates. It helps to think of the solutions instead of the obstacles. I&#39;m not always brilliant at it, but I am getting much better at catching myself before I say something negative or mean or limiting. And because of that, because of my willingness to say yes, when I am too tired or need to have something happen, Simon and Linnaea are much, much more willing to accomodate my need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: halfshadow1 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:halfshadow1@...\">halfshadow1@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 27 March, 2008 12:57:14 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: son calling me names<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep them locked up.

If you call someone that even if it is the <br/>\ncar in front of you them he will find it ok to repeat. You say it <br/>\nwhen upset so he can to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is not mad but playing with words and names (which we do a lot <br/>\nin our family) then you could say lets not use that word but how <br/>\nabout this instead. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I told him tonite that when he calls me names in it<br/>\n&gt; ruins our relationship,makes it yucky.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>he is how old? how would he be capable of understanding this. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n He does say he&#39;s sorry.

He knows <br/>\nthat he can get a rise out of you and he knows it hurts you. Why <br/>\ndoes he want to hurt you? <br/>\n<br/>\nI would talk about how he feels when he wants you to do something <br/>\nand you do not do it- look at how often he is asking and you are <br/>\ntaking one or five or ten more mins- can you do things right now <br/>\ninstead of in a min.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  Most of the time i jump up and do what he wants or get him what he<br/>\n&gt; asks for.
