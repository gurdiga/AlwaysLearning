One day he realised he was<br/>\nholding on to a label because it was an important part of how he<br/>\ndefined himself. But it didn&#39;t fit anymore.-==-<br/>\n<br/>\nI was like that.  I decided to stop eating meat 14 years ago after doing research in college about the food industry.  I was kind of proud to call myself a vegetarian.  Unschooling vegetarian single mom.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there were times that money was really tight, really really tight.  Sometimes someone would fix Richard and I a meal, usually with meat.  I ate those meals thankfully and happily.  When my 90 year old grandmother invited us to her home in Illinois for a weekend, she made us meat.  I ate that thankfully and happily.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few times on lists when I would write that I considered myself a vegetarian but that I ate meat when someone else cooked for me, and others would really jump on that.  I felt that they were really mean to me. &lt;g&gt;  One person wrote that even if I was going to someone&#39;s house for dinner, I could bring a dish so that Richard and I could still eat veggie.  She didn&#39;t get it &lt;G&gt;.  We were going to others houses because we couldn&#39;t, at the time, afford to make that dish!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it was when reading one of the many discussions about not using labels that I realized that I was hanging on to that label.  I was a little surprised, I don&#39;t tend to like labels, but I was hanging on to a label about myself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now I say I don&#39;t tend to eat meat.  Richard does eat meat, and that is ok.  He is very mindful about his food choices, much more than I am.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaty<br/>\n \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255388392,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"&quot;Kelly Halldorson&quot; &lt;kelly@...&gt;","profile":"kellygrafx","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Lazy Unschoolers?","postDate":"1268090974","msgId":51829,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBOUU0Rjg0NTFEQTQ2QjRCQUU3NTFGNzg4MTEwNzBGQExpdHRsZVZhaW8+","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":51827,"nextInTopic":51831,"prevInTime":51828,"nextInTime":51830,"topicId":51696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Jill wrote: +++I m getting a sense from your posts that you re trying to fit everyone into all these little niches defined by you. +++ Um...no exactly the","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-312949697\">Jill wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n+++I&#39;m getting a sense from your posts that you&#39;re trying to fit <br/>\neveryone into all these little niches defined by you. +++<br/>\n<br/>\nUm...no exactly the opposite.

David was a vegetarian for a long time before he and I got together. It was important to him, his vegetarianism. I&#39;ve never been a vegetarian. I&#39;m an omnivore. Although the omni- was fairly limited for a long time. And David joined me, more and more, in my meat eating. Not out of pressure from me, but because he wanted to, for whatever reason. But he still called himself a vegetarian. One day he realised he was holding on to a label because it was an important part of how he defined himself. But it didn&#39;t fit anymore. The fact that he eats meat, occasionally, doesn&#39;t make him a good or a bad person, unless you are a chicken. He just likes to eat meat sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose being labelled a vegetarian is a kind of a granfalloon, &quot;a proud and meaningless association of human beings.&quot; The assertion of being a vegetarian gave him something to hitch onto. However, coming onto a list that is about vegetarianism and saying that those folks who eat meat at holidays or who eat meat only once a month can be vegetarians too, well that feels strange. It&#39;s like coming on to a list that is about unschooling and saying that people can label themselves unschoolers even if it is just about intent and that should be fine. I met a woman who told me that she was an unschooler because she let her children switch from a subject or stay on a topic for longer or shorter periods of time than the curriculum she followed advised. That&#39;s a big stretch. I didn&#39;t argue, I didn&#39;t burst her granfalloon, but I recognized that she wasn&#39;t likely to be someone who I&#39;d look to for advise on how to unschool better. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my mom called herself a vegetarian as she was putting turkey  <br/>\nmeat into her mouth, all these thoughts ran through my head:  why the  <br/>\nlying, confusion, delusion?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m getting a sense from your posts that you&#39;re trying to fit  <br/>\neveryone into all these little niches defined by you.

It&#39;s just that people like to define others. And some unschoolers are very dogmatic about unschooling. I&#39;m not really dogmatic about anything. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see unschooling as a spectrum. I can see how people say...unschooling &quot;except for math&quot;....I may not *agree* with it but I get what they are talking about. I *get* both sides. I see why they call themselves unschoolers and I see why others say that&#39;s not unschooling. But I personally don&#39;t make anykind of final call on it myself. <br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nI often compare stuff like this to veganism. I am currently vegan. I have been vegan on and off for a good chunk of my adult life. I have only recently (the last three years or so) embraced the label vegan. Otherwise I just called myself vegetarian....and that was because I was intimidated by others...who may not think I was being vegan *enough*<br/>\n<br/>\nI eat honey. I occasionally will have eggs...ONLY if they are either ours (from our chickens) or I know exactly how the hens are treated and where they are coming from. We are talking maybe a dozen eggs a year if that.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there are people that would scream...YOU AREN&#39;T VEGAN!! And get quite angry about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nKind of how I used to feel about people who call themselves vegetarian but still occasionally eats fish. It used to drive me nuts! Because well...fish isn&#39;t a vegetable, LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I decided to take a long hard look at things. What is it I wanted? I wanted to reduce suffering. I wanted people to eat more with compassion. Well, if someone is vegetarian all year but aises their own turkeys to eat on Thanksgiving and Christmas does it really matter what they call themselves?  They are way closer to vegetarian than anything else. <br/>\n<br/>\nAND they are ultimately reducing suffering...something I can totally get on board with.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s not possible to look at unschooling in the same manner. I don&#39;t agree with the all or nothing approach....but I do *understand* it. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n+++And do you unschool, then?

I&#39;m pretty clear about what it looks like in my own house, but there are plenty of others that &quot;unschool&quot; and use charter schools or free schools and still call themselves unschoolers, or who put their kids in so many classes they have no down time.  I&#39;m left scratching my head a little wondering where they ever got the idea that they were unschoolers.  They may be super fantastic parents and the kids may be super fantastic kids and there is nothing wrong with making decisions like that for themselves, but I wonder why they call themselves unschoolers? <br/>\n<br/>\n I think this is where the idea of &quot;child led&quot; gets really intertwined and mixed up into unschooling, and makes it look like unschooling is something different than what it really is.  The child might lead a parent to enroll them into a charter school, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are unschooling.  If Chamille decided to go to school, she&#39;d no longer be unschooling, she would be schooling by her choice and I&#39;d be perfectly fine with that, well maybe a wee bit cringing, but mostly fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] my blog","postDate":"1267990963","msgId":51718,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA4MjREQjg3LTNDODEtNDVDMi05N0ZGLUMzQjY2NDQ2RDkyM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCOTNFMUFBLjEwMTAxMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDRCOTNFMUFBLjEwMTAxMDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":51717,"nextInTopic":51722,"prevInTime":51717,"nextInTime":51719,"topicId":51696,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://pamsoroosh.wordpress.com/ What about that one, Pam, with the questions?
