Something about <br/>\nthe ionization of the air makes everything feel different too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that effect needs a desert to work.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that surprised me was that in Pennsylvania when I was camping there <br/>\n(at Pennsic war, years back) the rain was warm.  In New Mexico, rain is <br/>\nalways cold.  I guess it&#39;s the altitude of the clouds, because even when it <br/>\nhits the ground it&#39;s still a mile above sea level, and the clouds in <br/>\nPennsylvania were low and we were maybe at 400 feet or something (I don&#39;t <br/>\nknow).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was used to rain drops being totally distinct from the air around them, <br/>\ntoo, and some of that sea level rain, like in England, is more like a drippy <br/>\nmist than the rain I had learned to recognize as rain.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Smell of rain","postDate":"1030551469","msgId":8940,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxZTgwMWMyNGVhZSQ3NDEwNWE2MCRmNzIxMDM0NEBwaC5jb3gubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDIwODI4MTM1OTIwLjM3NjQucW1haWxAd2ViMTQzMTEubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":8944,"prevInTime":8939,"nextInTime":8941,"topicId":8940,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Rain in the desert is one of my absolute favorite smells...
