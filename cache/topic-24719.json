Once again, I am seriously needing life <br/>\nadvice from all you experienced and wise people.  <br/>\n A little background:  Unschooling was a rapid and happy evolutionary journey <br/>\nfor us, but fate had some challenges in store for our family.  We weathered <br/>\nthrough an earthquake that damaged our home, a fire, a burglary, a stroke, <br/>\ncancer, a car accident, bankruptcy, and two grandparents and my brother&#39;s deaths.  <br/>\nOther than one year around preliminary divorce proceedings, the kids have <br/>\nnever been in school. However, now, years later, I am crumbling under the <br/>\nresponsibilities of being a single, working, unschooling mom.  I am exhausted, my <br/>\nhealth is tenuous, my finances nonexistent, and the sparkle/hope is fading from <br/>\nmy kids eyes.  We have a great relationship, filled with much love and respect, <br/>\nbut are struggling under the burdens of sadness and fear. For the past four <br/>\nyears, their dad has been disabled, with brain damage and addiction to <br/>\nprescription meds, after another serious car accident. I have just been told that the <br/>\nproperty where the kids and I live, is slated to be sold, and that we must <br/>\nrelocate in April.  I swear, I am not exaggerating all this. Kinda overwhelmed.  <br/>\nI have no intention of abandoning our unschooling philosophy, but I am trying <br/>\nto figure out, along with my kids, how to adapt our lives yet again. I have <br/>\nlittle time, energy or money to be the creative positive guiding influence that <br/>\nI have always striven to be.  The kids do not want to attend a large public <br/>\nschool, but we haven&#39;t found a small, progressive one either.  They don&#39;t quite <br/>\nknow what to do with themselves while I am away at work, errands, medical <br/>\nappointments and therapy for sixty hours a week.  Other than one personal friend <br/>\nwho is a registered child and family therapist, we have not been able to find a <br/>\ntherapist for teens who supports home or unschooling. So there is the <br/>\nframework for all my questions:<br/>\nAre their any articles or archived discussions about unschooling as a single <br/>\nand/or working parent?  <br/>\nHas anyone found a supportive therapist that won&#39;t report unschoolers for <br/>\nneglect?<br/>\nIf due to financial or medical necessity, you became less available to your <br/>\nunschooled children, what would you do?<br/>\nI feel very self indulgent even posting this, but I am trembling to face the <br/>\ndays ahead.<br/>\nBright blessings and gratitude to you all,<br/>\nBird</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24707,"nextTopicId":24734}}
