Many things *are* phases. Not everything and not for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy father thought it time to get me a horse when I was 13 because he was afraid it might be a phase and he wanted me to have a horse before I outgrew the phase and discovered boys. &lt;G&gt; Little did he know, it would be a l-o-n-g phase, and the *boys* that I eventually discovered would be my sons! &lt;G&gt; I haven&#39;t ridden since Cameron (22) was an infant, but at one time it was an all-consuming phase!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut *many* things are phases, and it can help a parent get through the difficult stage if she truly *knows* it&#39;s short term. Nursing is a phase. Holding their hands is a phase (Although both my boys will still hold my hand---it&#39;s not the same thing---or maybe it is. Maybe I&#39;m getting so forgetful that they feel the need to protect/watch out for *me*! &lt;G&gt;). Carrying them is a phase. Feeding them. Co-sleeping. Housing them. Some manners of dress. Some haircuts. A teen&#39;s seemingly excessive need for sleep and its accompanying wacky sleep schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf parents can see the phase as just that: a period of need or discovery, it can make it easier to accept and enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron&#39;s Goth phase was short. His skating phase. His filming phase. His magic phase. Honestly, I miss them all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany, many passions are phases. Some DO become lifelong passions, but many come and go. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe *just* drop the &quot;just?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&quot;There is no single effort more radical in its potential for saving the world than a transformation of the way we raise our children.&quot; Marianne Williamson<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":210924168,"authorName":"mommy2mysweeties","from":"&quot;mommy2mysweeties&quot; &lt;jdwatson@...&gt;","profile":"mommy2mysweeties","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Phrases","postDate":"1286556557","msgId":57726,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk4bmkyZCtvaWcwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk4amdodStqbzl0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57725,"nextInTopic":57727,"prevInTime":57725,"nextInTime":57727,"topicId":57684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a mere lurker here, but can I pipe in for a minute to share a phrase?

This one still hurts. My dad&#39;s favorite phrase and his basic philosophy of parenting was, &quot;buck up.&quot; As in suck it up, deal with it, too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have such sad memories of my first semester at college. My parents settled me into my dorm five hours away from home at the college they picked out because they were paying for it, left me there with no car and no friends, and went home proud to have the first college student in the entire family. I would call home and cry and beg them to come get me and bring me home and let me go to a local college. Their response was always the same, &quot;buck up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I did. I hated being there so I took tons of hours of classes each semester and summer school and finished in three years instead of four so I could get out of there. I guess they look on that as success on their part. I bucked up and got that degree. I also married within two months of graduating and left their house.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so not a perfect parent, and am often impatient and harsh with my kids. And then I feel crushed when I am. But if nothing else, I&#39;ll never tell them to just buck up and deal with something that hurts or troubles them when I am perfectly capable of helping them find a solution that will bring them peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennifer</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Phrases","postDate":"1286553588","msgId":57725,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM3NUMwMzJGLTk3MEMtNDQxMS1BMjk2LTQxNTNFMDREMUE0M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk4bjlkOCtvZG9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk4bjlkOCtvZG9oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57724,"nextInTopic":57726,"prevInTime":57724,"nextInTime":57726,"topicId":57684,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-He also used to start off lectures to my brother and I saying You are not acting like the X year old that you are and the funny part was he always got our","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-672880317\">-=-He also used to start off lectures to my brother and I saying &quot;You  <br/>\nare not acting like the X year old that you are&quot; and the funny part  <br/>\nwas he always got our ages wrong. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s really sad--mostly that he had canned speeches to give.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I also remember an incident with my mom-I must have been 3 or 4,and  <br/>\nshe was yelling at me, and I felt wronged, though I dont remember if I  <br/>\nwas doing something naughty or not, but I told her that when I grew  <br/>\nup, I was going to be a mean mommy to my kids because she was so mean,  <br/>\nand how did she feel about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Ive often reflected on that incident...it has been a touchstone for  <br/>\nme, because of course I realized that I never wanted my children to  <br/>\nfeel that way about me, and I realized that I was going to have to  <br/>\nreally learn a whole new way to be a parent, and that I wanted a much  <br/>\ndifferent relationship with my kids.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t mind at all if my kids are better parents than I ever even  <br/>\nconsidered being.

It was made pretty clear to me as a young kid that I was &quot;selfish&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of others were &quot;You made your bed, now you have to lie in it.&quot; and &quot;You can&#39;t have cake and eat it too.&quot;  I had no idea what either of these meant as a kid but now I do and think they&#39;re damaging.  I&#39;ve seen the &quot;making your bed&quot; philosophy play out with my mom&#39;s interactions with Logan recently.  While she didn&#39;t use the phrase with him, the idea that a 4 year old should suffer because of something he did (drop a toy) is repulsive to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDina<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, October 07, 2010 12:40 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Phrases<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   <br/>\n&gt; -=-Another of those is: &quot;You play-- you pay.&quot;-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Did your parents say that to you?<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t even know how it would be used.
