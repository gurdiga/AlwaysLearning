He isn&#39;t willing to stop watching television to make<br/>\ncookies, play with the video camera (my Zach just discovered this and loves<br/>\nit), go fishing, a trip to the zoo, whatever?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you sit and watch with him?  My kids watch such &quot;educational&quot; shows as<br/>\n&quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Lizzy Macquire&quot;.  When we watch together it almost never<br/>\nfails to spark some interesting discussion.  We talk ethics, history,<br/>\nreligion, economy, all kinds of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a big believer in not sitting on your behind all day so I get myself<br/>\nbusy and lo and behold, here come the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes any of the above sound familiar to you?  Why is it that you want him to<br/>\nwatch less television?  Just a thought from a mom of 2 very rambunctious<br/>\nboys thrown in with some fantastic girls----If you are trying to get the kid<br/>\nto &quot;control his wilds&quot; after television or any other time, I think you may<br/>\nhave already set up an uphill battle for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--a recent suburban refugee</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3105,"nextTopicId":3120}}
