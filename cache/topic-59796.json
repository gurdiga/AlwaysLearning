Don&#39;t do or say things you shouldn&#39;t say <br/>\nor do.  Make your child&#39;s life so wonderful and happy that your kids will never <br/>\nrun from you.

I don&#39;t want to offer stories from our life, only to have them picked apart and argued, so I say nothing.  All while making note of which conversation topics are no longer safe for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI do speak up and disagree when our kids are nearby, if only to validate for the kids something they may be thinking, or offer a perspective they don&#39;t often (if ever) hear.
