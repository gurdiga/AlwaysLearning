A couple pieces we bought in a junk store in Palmer, Alaska the winter I was pregnant with Dylan.  I have a bowl and pitcher from the Renaissance Fair in Anchorage.  I think about my dad and how he used to start telling a funny story and laugh so hard he couldn&#39;t finish it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI sometimes wash just what we&#39;ll need.

If you could buy happiness for a couple hundred dollars, a dishwasher might be it.   You have a place to stash dirty dishes to get them out of your way (I use my oven)  and you have a button to push when you want the dishes clean.  Do that instead of feeling resentful or being tired.  My dream is to someday have a dishwasher.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived in Knik, Alaska.  We had no plumbing.  I heated water on the wood stove.  It was a big deal to get a pile of dishes clean.  I think of that now when I&#39;m facing a stack of dishes.  I can turn a knob and have hot water, pull a plug and let the water out the drain.

If it&#39;s an assumption, it seems a rather snarky one.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps what you consider a mess is not what they consider a mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I did a handful of years ago with my husband was to find out what house-things were important to him and I let him know what things were important to me. Then we both relaxed considerably in the areas that weren&#39;t such huge concerns to either of us. <br/>\n<br/>\nI take care of being sure we all always have clean clothes and towels, and I don&#39;t mind checking everyone&#39;s bedrooms for dirty clothes. He takes care of being sure he gets his work clothes to/from the dry cleaners. I like the kitchen clean before I go to bed, so I load and start the dishwasher if that&#39;s needed. He doesn&#39;t care a bit whether I cook dinner or not, but I do make an effort to keep the fridge and pantry and freezer stocked with things he can use to make himself dinner if I haven&#39;t prepared dinner for the both of us. One or the other of us will clean the toilet or tub when we notice it&#39;s that time. Those are the only household things that are a high priority between the two of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means I let go of feeling like dusting, mopping, and vacuuming &quot;had&quot; to happen on a certain schedule. Those things happen when one or the other of us feels like it&#39;s time (or when company&#39;s coming over [g]). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t expect my kiddo to do any housework. As a result of not having that expectation, it&#39;s a lovely gift to me when he totes his dirty clothes to the laundry hamper, and when he takes his dirty dishes to the kitchen before he goes to bed, and when he declutters his floor so I can walk through the room. Likewise, I consider it a gift to him when I make sure I have all the dirty clothes or dishes where they need to be to get clean, and when I declutter his floor so *he* can walk through it more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the dishes piling up is a bone of contention for you, what can you do to ease that? Maybe use disposable plates, utensils, and cups. Have more one-pot meals. Consider no-cook / low-cook options: sandwiches; hot dogs (the weiners can be grilled outdoors or broiled indoors on foil); crackers + cheese + fruit; cereal + fruit/juice + boiled eggs(you can boil a bunch one day then stash them in the fridge to grab as needed throughout the week) + heat-n-serve bacon; etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my kiddo&#39;s favorite late-night meals is nachos that I make in the toaster oven: piece of foil with tortilla chips on it, which I sprinkle generously with pre-shredded cheese -- takes 5 or 6 minutes, there&#39;s no clean-up, and it&#39;s filling. If I&#39;m heading to bed, I don&#39;t mind making those for him on my way. He and I have come up with several late-night meals that I can make quick-n-easy for him when I&#39;m headed to bed, that require no clean-up. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Needed to touch base with some unschoolers","postDate":"1280642043","msgId":56518,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDNTUwQkZCLjEwMDA0MDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUyOTkyQkE1LTVFMjUtNDdFNC05MjY4LTQ1RjJFMEZDOEM5NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGkzMnM5dStoYmM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RTI5OTJCQTUtNUUyNS00N0U0LTkyNjgtNDVGMkUwRkM4Qzk2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56517,"nextInTopic":56519,"prevInTime":56517,"nextInTime":56519,"topicId":56501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I picked them up, over the years, at thrift <br/>\nstores and garage sales and discount places like Big Lots and Tuesday <br/>\nMorning. I get pretty ones, because there are lots of pretty ones out <br/>\nthere, but the main thing is to have different sizes and shapes. I keep <br/>\nthem at hand - they are stored vertically between some dividers so they <br/>\nare easy to pull out and put away. Big trays for big projects, little <br/>\ntrays for little bitty projects. The keep all the supplies kind of <br/>\ncorralled and the whole project can be moved easily out of the way, <br/>\ntemporarily. They&#39;re really great. They keep crayons and colored pencils <br/>\nfrom rolling out of reach and they keep zillions of tiny scraps of paper <br/>\nfrom spreading all over the table. They keep spills contained. They are <br/>\nsolid and often even have handles. And they&#39;re thin and easy to store. <br/>\nAnd, did I mention pretty? Occasionally I use one as a tray - for <br/>\ncarrying and serving food and beverage, too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Needed to touch base with some unschoolers","postDate":"1280638583","msgId":56517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUyOTkyQkE1LTVFMjUtNDdFNC05MjY4LTQ1RjJFMEZDOEM5NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkzMnM5dStoYmM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkzMnM5dStoYmM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56515,"nextInTopic":56518,"prevInTime":56516,"nextInTime":56518,"topicId":56501,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-**Though it s also a mess, man of our projects are in boxes (like the flat boxes sodas come in, or the lids of xerox boxes) so they can be moved off of or","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1215660294\">-=-**Though it&#39;s also a mess, man of our projects are in boxes (like  <br/>\nthe flat boxes sodas come in, or the lids of xerox boxes) so they can be<br/>\nmoved off of or onto a table.

Like, there&#39;s no point in letting the dishes pile up to try to make a point. What point? Who cares? The kids and the hubby sure don&#39;t care if the house is a mess.

I&#39;m gonna turn on some music, put on my boogie shoes and get the housework train rolling down the track tomorrow. And if anyone wants to hop on board they will be welcomed, but if they don&#39;t then I&#39;ll just boogie to whatever music I want to listen to and have fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my house and my spirits will feel better.

My kids are now 23 (gulp), 19, almost 12 and 9. We spend as much time in the bush as we can and the rest of it in Whitehorse, Yukon. My hubby is now working with the Dept. of Environment up here, and as a volunteer Parks Officer, so lots of cool offerings there for bush kids big and small.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m in sort of the same boat as the other poster who talked about working and leaving kids with more responsibility, if perhaps paddling down a somewhat different stream. Things tend to be somewhat &quot;chaotic&quot; at first glance in our house, but as you look around and figure out what&#39;s actually there it&#39;s a very happy mess. <br/>\n<br/>\nPiles of camping gear left from our last trip to Little Salmon Lake to pick morel mushrooms where there was a big fire last year. The bits are out and ready on the table for little girl&#39;s beautiful jewellery making when she wants them next. The bag of percussion instruments sits on top of the drum kit, and the guitars are strewn around the living room in a happily disorganized fashion. My sewing machine is on the coffee table in case we want to sew some patches on clothes, or maybe put together a fabulous bandanna.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pantry is bulging with easy to make food for when kids are too busy to stop, ingredients for when we all want to bake or make &quot;recipes&quot; (existing or new to this planet), potting soil for when we get around to re-potting plants. The sideboard holds pens, paper, the computer that my hubby bartered for with his last computer help job so that the kids can have their own again, and several boxes of unclassified &quot;good stuff&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways,I just needed a touch stone at this point in our unschooling journey. I&#39;ve been at home with kids for a long time now, and while it&#39;s the all and the everything of everything, it can tend to isolate even one who likes isolation when you live in a place as small as this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for being that touch point,<br/>\nNadine</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56488,"nextTopicId":56583}}
