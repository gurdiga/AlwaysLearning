Food.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I discovered only after starting unschooling and reading this<br/>\nlist, is the critical importance of food and making sure wour children are<br/>\nnot hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they are hungry, my children don&#39;t look at all like the idea I had<br/>\nabout hungry children. They do not say &quot;I&#39;m hungry mom, can you please fix<br/>\nsomething for me&quot; and go play giving me some time to fix the said thing. In<br/>\nfact, I realised my children are not really conscious of being hungry until<br/>\nthey are litterally starving. If I wait for them to ask for food, I&#39;m<br/>\nheading to a full blown crisis. Reaching for the pack of cookies won&#39;t be<br/>\nfast enough for their sense of emergency...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet there are early signals. When my children get hungry, they start to<br/>\nwhine and cry about little things. They pick up fight. They start teasing<br/>\neach other...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow when my children start whining, the first question I ask myself is<br/>\n&quot;when did they last eat?&quot;. And I offer a snack and drink. The results are<br/>\namazing!  I don&#39;t ignore their pledge. I also try to say yes more readily<br/>\nand be more reliable to follow up with my yeses. But food is incredibly<br/>\ncritical.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing at other people&#39;s place, where the food is less readily available and<br/>\nI do not have much say about what food will be served and when can be a<br/>\nvery very challenging situation. I visited some friends who parent in a<br/>\nmainstream way, and navigating food was complicated. Their children were<br/>\nonly allowed to eat at breakfast, lunch and diner time... That was a good<br/>\nrecipe for whining and fighting kids... A stay over visit to grand parents<br/>\nhouse can be similarly challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving snack food with me when I visit other people&#39;s places has helped. If<br/>\nI can&#39;t just give them the snack inside, because other children are not<br/>\nallowed snacks at that given time, or just to prevent too many raised<br/>\neyebrows, I try to encouraging my kids to go for a little walk or for a<br/>\nshort visit to the bakery so I can offer snacks more freely...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m amazed to realise how much struggle between parents and children can be<br/>\navoided simply by making food more readily available.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am grateful for this list and my neighboring unschooling family to<br/>\nhave opened my eyes on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms","postDate":"1323033355","msgId":64087,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhQVC1UM1VCQmtaTmlLWnFpUHF3aDZuUk1wejRVUGJCa0JOK25nKz13WUhHZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM5MzIyMTJEMERBRjQxQ0I5QTMyNzNBRjQ2NkM0REQyQE5FV1BDPg==","referencesHeader":"PGphb2NrZyt0MjhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MzkzMjIxMkQwREFGNDFDQjlBMzI3M0FGNDY2QzRERDJATkVXUEM+"},"prevInTopic":64084,"nextInTopic":64092,"prevInTime":64086,"nextInTime":64088,"topicId":63883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"About the whining...

I think she’s four years old and can’t possibly understand what difference it can make to grandma if she wears the clothes she likes.   I think grandma should chill and be glad she has healthy, happy grandkids who want to see her.   But since you can’t change your mom, then change the circumstances.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, don’t go to their house for awhile until your kids can understand what’s expected of them.   Invite your parents to visit you, if you like.   Get them a motel room near your house, go on outings familiar to your kids where they can be in play clothes.  Reduce the stress on your family.  Your kids will get older.  <br/>\n<br/>\n If your little girl likes to wear two dresses find clothes she can layer that will look coordinated. If she’s clean and covered then don’t fight with her. She’s not your mother’s child, she’s yours. You’re not your mother’s child anymore either. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s hard to be four years old, in someone else’s house, where big people are making demands on you for no sensible reason you can see, and where your nice mom is stressed out and not being very kind to you.    I’d whine and cry too.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrandma  expects to get her way consistently, with everyone,  and doesn’t seem to care whether she makes a little girl cry or a son in law feel less than welcome.   I think your daughter behaved just like any normal four year old would under the circumstances.    <br/>\n<br/>\n***don&#39;t like that they whine and cry about little things frequently (not sure how to help the kids with this but I see it as a problem too),***<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to avoid things that make them whine and cry.   Listen to them before they feel like whining or crying is the next thing they need to try to make you understand.  Avoid situations they’re not ready for.  <br/>\nAre your kids very sensitive?  Maybe they have some of your mother’s demanding, want-things-my-way nature.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout being demanding sometimes, how do you talk to them?  How long does it take you to respond to them?   Are they waiting a long time for your help and getting frustrated?   Maybe you’re gentle and attentive and they are expressing some of their genetic nature.  Your reminders to be nicer will help over time.  Maybe you can play some games about how people sound when they’re angry or happy or mean or nice so that your kids start to think about that.  They’re so young.  They have lots of time to learn and grow. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I think the problem is one I&#39;ve created of giving my kids too much choice in the beginning, not looking enough at the particulars of the situation; ***<br/>\n<br/>\nChoice is good. Choice with help from you is good.   I think the problem might be that you’re a little bullied by your mother.

(Since we have been homeschooling, we are just avoiding that conversation of switching to unschooling until we are forced to have it with them) Our parents aren&#39;t exactly on board with homeschooling, let alone unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand that there is a pressure from family and society and people tend to be judgement and jump to conclusions when they see things that they do not see as &quot;normal.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the frustration with the whining. We went through that but at an older age. Our son whined a lot from the age of about 7 until we realized that we were causing the whining by not listening to him. I am in no way saying that about you,so please do not take it like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I really didn&#39;t have much advice to offer. I just wanted to let you know that I understand. Family can be harsher than society when it comes to the way we raise our children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry but I forgot the name of the poster that talked about going shopping with the children to get clothes that would &quot;appropriate&quot; for grandma and grandpa, but that is an excellent idea. There were a lot of good ideas in that post, so thank you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the comments about timeouts. I know that many parents do do timeouts and see them and a good way to discipline your children. We did used these frequently until our oldest we about 13. We were discussing &quot;proper behavior&quot; (yes this was before unschooling had made its way into our lives), and she told us how humiliated it was for her to stand or sit in time out. She didn&#39;t stop the behavior bc she knew it was wrong. She stopped the behavior bc she didn&#39;t want to be humiliated like that again. We discussed some of the things she remembered being sent to time out for. After talking about them with her, we realized that most of the time it was a simple misunderstanding (usually on our part, not hers).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a problem with the idea of social norms to begin with. I have an issue with the major telling the minority what is acceptable and what is not. I think that within almost all of us there is an idea or feeling of what is &quot;right or wrong&quot; on a large scale. I think most know that murder and stealing are wrong. But who really cares if a 4 year old wears a pink dress on top if her black one with a pair of zebra striped leggings underneath and cowgirl boots and baseball cap. I see that I think, &quot;Wow, look at that creativity.&quot; And if an adult is going to criticize something like that, than I feel sorry for that adult bc they have never know what it is like to see that world through the eyes f a child. It is an amazing world and making them conform steal that from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeAnna  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;LydiaK&quot; &lt;princessjasmine05@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My daugher, Nisa, is four, and my son, Shaiah, is two.  Right now we are visiting my mom and dad for Thanksgiving.  I am trying to figure out how to balance giving my kids choices and helping my parents be comfortable with my kids.  I remind the kids before we come visit that their grandparents like for them to wear clothes and underwear and diapers while we are here.  I also encourage my son to wear boys clothes when we visit b/c my parents are uncomfortable with him wearing dresses.  At home they are often naked or dressing up in many different clothing combinations.  A lot of times I have let my daughter go out with some unusual outfit that she put together, as long as it is seasonally appropriate (or I will bring sweaters, pants, etc. if I think she might get chilly).  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This morning my folks wanted to take us out for breakfast and I tried to find Nisa something appropriate to wear.  I let her choose among the clothes I&#39;d packed for her.  She didn&#39;t want to wear those clothes, she wanted to wear a toddler jumpsuit she&#39;d found and has been wearing the past couple days since we&#39;ve been here.  I let her wear it with a peair of pants but my mom didn&#39;t want her to wear it and told her to pick something else.  She took a long time trying to choose, and none of her choices were appropriate.  I told my parents they should go ahead without her since she couldn&#39;t pick something to wear.  She kept insisting that she be allowed to wear one dress on top of another dress, which did look kind of silly.  My mother tried to discourage her, and my husband jumped in and told her she could wear what she wanted to wear.  They all went out to breakfast, but I know my parents were not happy about how my daughter looked.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I should mention, my mother is very picky about appearances and looking nice in public.  She and my dad are very well known in the community as well.  I am trying to help my kids behave in ways that will improve their relationship with their grandparents, whom they enjoy spending time with.  I know that my parents have some issues with some of the things my kids do or get to choose.  They pretty much think my kids are spoiled and my dad especially has a hard time being with them because they don&#39;t obey him the way he is used to.  They both used to spank me and my sister as kids, and they are used to the kind of obedience you get from spanking.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My husband, on the other hand, does not care much about appearances and social norms.  He went to breakfast this morning without showering, in the clothes he wore yesterday.  He did brush his teeth and wash his face.  I don&#39;t really care when he does these things, but my parents have complained before about him being smelly and have asked him to wear deodorant when he is here, which he refuses to do.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I know my daughter is upset with me this morning, and has been kind of upset with me most of the time we&#39;ve been here because I&#39;ve been chasing her around trying to get her underwear on and making sure she is appropriate when we are here.  She did not want to do what was expected of her to go to breakfast (brush her hair, change into different clothes) and was very upset when I suggested she just not go.  Some days I am very good at helping her do these kinds of things without a problem, and other days, like today, I am not as nice as I usually am.  I think I feel a lot of pressure to get her to do certain things while we are here, and the stress makes me less kind.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My parents do not like how my kids talk to us (they can be pretty demanding, although they usually will rephrase a demand if I suggest they ask me more nicely next time), don&#39;t like that they whine and cry about little things frequently (not sure how to help the kids with this but I see it as a problem too), and don&#39;t like that they don&#39;t listen and obey right away.  I would like to find ways to help them not only for my parents but for myself in some of these areas.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the problem is one I&#39;ve created of giving my kids too much choice in the beginning, not looking enough at the particulars of the situation; and now my kids, especially my daughter, expect to always have things exactly how they want, without regard to others.  This could be more because they are so young, but I think my behavior has also contributed.  I am looking for help on how to deal with this situation better next time, and also how to generally shift away from them feeling entitled to whatever they want without regard for others.  What kinds of suggestions can I give my kids that they would be more willing to hear?  Maybe my tone of voice is the problem, as I feel I am bullying them rather than offering choices when I tell my daughter she can either wear the dresses I&#39;ve picked for her or not go.  I also feel that I should be working harder to convince her to go because it would mean a lot to her grandparents, rather than giving her the choice not to go if she doesn&#39;t want to wear the right clothes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks a lot, and happy 10th anniversary (yesterday) to the list!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lydia Koltai<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms","postDate":"1322801246","msgId":64043,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVqbWR1LUoxQ2NMMG04dHFKOXg0amZBOEY0YnlLZldpaGhPU05hc1NYVHB4SjNxUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJEMzZCQkM1LUI1NTQtNDkyNy1CNjg4LTlBRDcxRjgzMUE3QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":64039,"nextInTopic":64047,"prevInTime":64042,"nextInTime":64044,"topicId":63883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have had the experience of having to testify in courts for friends who were excellent parents but because their children were considered unruly by the &quot;social norms&quot; were removed from the household. I never had the problem personally but have watched while others tried to explain their unschooling techniques to a court that had not only no understanding of unschooling but no understanding of homeschools in general. The issue which always was used was the behaviors of the children to prove the state&#39;s charges of why the children should be in foster care instead of remaining with their parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this day and time, it is very easy for an angry neighbor, good intentioned relative or a doctor to open an investigation into a family. When children&#39;s services interviews and spends time with the children there are certain benchmarks they observe for documentation for the court. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the list is really  a &quot;collection of ideas that put principals into action&quot; I would think other&#39;s experiences would be most helpful to people who have just entered into unschooling. I for one, do not consider unschooling &quot;radical&quot;, but that is JMO. It has been around longer than regular homeschooling in this area, but most people in the early years tried to stay under the radar to prevent problems. Public schools were/ are so intent on testing that unschoolers if required to be tested were evaluated to be way below their grade level. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a><br/>\nDate: Thu, 1 Dec 2011 07:51:22 -0500<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Dec 1, 2011, at 1:22 AM, Liz M wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have been homeschooling the unschooling way since 1979.

It about the unschoolingness of the ideas. Even if John Holt returned from the dead to post, his ideas would be pulled apart and analyzed if they undermined the principles discussed here: respect for kids feelings, trust in their ability to learn and desire to, support for who they are, partnership with the child and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list isn&#39;t a collection of &quot;it works for my family&quot; ideas from unschoolers. It&#39;s a collection of ideas that put the principles (as listed above) into action.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose isn&#39;t to limit what members choose to do in their families. The purpose is to keep this resource focused so members can use it like a radical unschooling reference book. Members can look up how the principles apply in practice to brushing teeth, sibling rudeness, bedtimes, food, hours of television or video games, boredom, relatives and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a member posts a suggestion that could potentially undermine some of the principles, it&#39;s then pulled apart, analyzed, its flaws (when applied to a family with different personalities) exposed. Then, often, ideas that use the principles are offered as alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have two kids that have graduated from college with honors who were unschooled and one in college now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe results indicate you were able to find ideas that &quot;work&quot; for the particular mix of personalities in your family. (I put &quot;work&quot; in quotes since there isn&#39;t a single definition everyone agrees on.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this list focuses on are ideas that will work -- support kids in making more principled choices -- regardless of personalities. In other words, solutions that use principles based on basic human needs such as to be trusted, respected, supported, treated with kindness and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several families here with adult children too. Families who have, since their kids were small, discussed, analyzed, read, thought about, tried out, observed outcomes of solutions to problems to find ways that work AND do not compromise the principles. And these adult children are socially adept, personable, out in the world making responsible decisions, holding jobs or in college. They are not heathens, unproductive, selfish, nose-thumbers of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What I am reading from your post is if someone disagrees with YOUR method, then it is wrong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf an idea undermines the principles, then it isn&#39;t useful for this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; I have many friends whose kids have been unschooled for many years, but are not unruly kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSame here. But this list focuses on solutions to problems that are respectful AND solve the problem, trusting AND solve the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that while learning a new approach using skills not fully understood, the results can be less than ideal. Then parents can bring the situations here to have them analyzed, to see where their thinking is off that&#39;s got them in this pickle, to see better solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to figure out how to be respectful of kids wants while also being respectful of others. It&#39;s especially difficult when all the solutions to that problem most people have seen in their lives disregard the child&#39;s wishes and put other people first. (It&#39;s how most of us were raised. It&#39;s what we see in TV families. It&#39;s what we see out in public. It&#39;s what mothers often trade as &quot;ideas that work&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *are* ways to do both. This list focuses on approaches that do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing both doesn&#39;t necessarily mean at the same time. A child can&#39;t be naked at Grandma&#39;s house and be respectful if Grandma objects. But the mom can find times for her child to be naked. She can find clothes that the child finds wearable. She can choose to not visit Grandma until her daughter is old enough to understand the situation well enough and keep her clothes on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe approaches offered here are very much about seeing the big picture and being proactive rather than reactive. (Reactive solutions are offered too since parents can&#39;t predict everything and sometimes end up in awkward situations. But the main thrust is to plan ahead to avoid past problems, judge whether the child is capable of what&#39;s needed of them, and hopefully have an exit plan in case they aren&#39;t! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere people often get confused when working with these new ideas is in seeing the child&#39;s want as inflexible and trying to work around that. What helps is being sensitive to the child&#39;s abilities. If a child is adamantly holding onto a rude idea, there&#39;s a bigger, underlying issue. The conventional assumption is the child is bad, rude, untrained and needs fixed. But here people are helped to see beneath the behavior. It could be age. It could be tiredness or hungriness or overwhelmedness. It could be the child doesn&#39;t trust the mom with her needs so feels she needs to fight or dig in her heels to get them met. The child is letting the mom know there&#39;s a problem. It&#39;s up to the mom to change the situation, not change the child to suit the situation (the child wasn&#39;t ready to be in.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat isn&#39;t okay is to continue to allow the child to be rude. The solutions might involve leaving. Or getting out as much as possible. Or looking at the problem from a whole new perspective and finding some outside the box solution the child likes. And definitely recognizing the child may not be ready before planning another similar situation. And when it does come up again, letting the child know what will be expected of them and come up with solutions to avoid past problems. And have an exit plan! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; What I have is enough age and years of experience to know that allowing kids to be little heathens and disregard the feelings of others is a dead end street for those kids later in life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t take years of experience to see that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can take reading the list for several weeks to see that no one here advocates such a thing. To see that the respectful-of-kids solutions are NOT about ignoring the feelings of others. The goal is finding solutions that are respectful of the child AND respectful of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; They are being set up to fail in being productive citizens and careers because they can&#39;t always have their way in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think that&#39;s what the list is advocating, you&#39;d best sign off!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we&#39;re advocating but can&#39;t see how the ideas won&#39;t lead there, then ask. Don&#39;t assume the ideas must be leading there and attack them. *Ask* how kids manage to think of others. *Ask* how kids turn out who &quot;get their way&quot;.  (It&#39;s clearer to see it as kids whose needs are treated with respect and met in ways that are respectful of others, kind, doable.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we&#39;re discussing navigating social norms, I do hope you helped your kids take a good amount of time to get a feel for a new place -- to figure out how it works, what its goals are, what it&#39;s purpose is -- before they jump in with snap conclusions and try to fix what they perceive as wrong. It&#39;s potentially embarrassing for them and they&#39;ll be seen as rude.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; We ALL have to follow rules and fit in to survive at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe operative word is &quot;at some point.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;d argue with &quot;have to&quot;. The approach here is &quot;choose to because it makes sense&quot;. The approach here is helping kids make respectful, kind, thoughtful choices in meeting their needs. The approach here is in being respectful of kids&#39; abilities and using their less than stellar choices as feedback on what they&#39;re capable of and on how well we&#39;re communicating. If they&#39;re not capable of being respectful yet, then it&#39;s up to the mom to be the buffer between her child and the world, protecting the child but also protecting the world from the child. And then she can wait and watch before subjecting her child and other people to similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; As much as I would like it to be different in society it is not now and will never be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou certainly can. You *choose* not to. You make -- I hope -- decisions weighing the good parts and bad parts of various options.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the goal here. To help kids make better choices. Not to memorize mom&#39;s better choices. But to do what you do and make choices they believe are better. When kids are young, their skills are beginner skills. They don&#39;t have the experience and maturity to make the choices they will as adults. So we act as their partners. Not *making* them comply with right behavior. But being their partner in their journey to thoughtful choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;  if a state Dept. of Children&#39;s services wants to take away children it is not the unschooling part they use in court but the behavior of the children which indicates to a &quot;traditional&quot; court they children&#39;s social needs are not being met in their opinion by those parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBehavior will be a red flag. Kids&#39; behavior towards others will be part of the evidence. But kids aren&#39;t being taken away because they&#39;re rude. There&#39;s way more needs to be wrong in the family than just rudeness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like fear-based advice. It sounds like something personal that you&#39;re trying to avoid at all costs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take the fear out of the equation, then parents have time to help their kids make thoughtful choices. But just because a 4 yo isn&#39;t capable of it yet, isn&#39;t a reason to put on the &quot;I need to make her act right or she&#39;ll be a rude adult&quot; glasses that block out more respectful-of-kids solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms","postDate":"1322751481","msgId":64026,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY4QUIwMjE5LUVCNzgtNDRCQi04Q0FELTA0OUU4QzYxQTc5MEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNUUxMkQyLTZGNDgtNDI5RC1BRTExLTIyNDc5OEIyQzA0QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGphb2NrZyt0MjhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkxVMTU1LVczODcyRTZCMEIyREYxMUQ2Njc5OUREOUJDQzBAcGh4LmdibD4sIDxDNjU3NzRFNS1CRjU5LTQyNzctQjZCNC01ODQ1NEM4M0EyNjlAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxCTFUxNTUtVzI4M0VFMDU1NTI3NDkyNTFFNjU2NzA5QkIxMEBwaHguZ2JsPiA8MTA1RTEyRDItNkY0OC00MjlELUFFMTEtMjI0Nzk4QjJDMDRCQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":64024,"nextInTopic":64033,"prevInTime":64025,"nextInTime":64027,"topicId":63883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-If a member posts a suggestion that could potentially undermine some of the principles, it s then pulled apart, analyzed, its flaws (when applied to a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-880669624\">-=-If a member posts a suggestion that could potentially undermine some of the principles, it&#39;s then pulled apart, analyzed, its flaws (when applied to a family with different personalities) exposed.

You came talking about time-outs and training.    When someone lives in a place or time where spanking is accepted and expected, time-outs can seem pretty progressive.   Today, with children whose parents might have been born in 1979 or even 1989, it&#39;s nowhere near the cutting edge of how to deal with a child expressing his needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy method of unschooling isn&#39;t my singular method.

Members can look up how the principles apply in practice to brushing teeth, sibling rudeness, bedtimes, food, hours of television or video games, boredom, relatives and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a member posts a suggestion that could potentially undermine some of the principles, it&#39;s then pulled apart, analyzed, its flaws (when applied to a family with different personalities) exposed. Then, often, ideas that use the principles are offered as alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have two kids that have graduated from college with honors who were unschooled and one in college now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The results indicate you were able to find ideas that &quot;work&quot; for the particular mix of personalities in your family. (I put &quot;work&quot; in quotes since there isn&#39;t a single definition everyone agrees on.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this list focuses on are ideas that will work -- support kids in making more principled choices -- regardless of personalities. In other words, solutions that use principles based on basic human needs such as to be trusted, respected, supported, treated with kindness and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several families here with adult children too. Families who have, since their kids were small, discussed, analyzed, read, thought about, tried out, observed outcomes of solutions to problems to find ways that work AND do not compromise the principles. And these adult children are socially adept, personable, out in the world making responsible decisions, holding jobs or in college. They are not heathens, unproductive, selfish, nose-thumbers of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I am reading from your post is if someone disagrees with YOUR method, then it is wrong<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If an idea undermines the principles, then it isn&#39;t useful for this list.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have many friends whose kids have been unschooled for many years, but are not unruly kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Same here. But this list focuses on solutions to problems that are respectful AND solve the problem, trusting AND solve the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that while learning a new approach using skills not fully understood, the results can be less than ideal. Then parents can bring the situations here to have them analyzed, to see where their thinking is off that&#39;s got them in this pickle, to see better solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to figure out how to be respectful of kids wants while also being respectful of others. It&#39;s especially difficult when all the solutions to that problem most people have seen in their lives disregard the child&#39;s wishes and put other people first. (It&#39;s how most of us were raised. It&#39;s what we see in TV families. It&#39;s what we see out in public. It&#39;s what mothers often trade as &quot;ideas that work&quot;.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere *are* ways to do both. This list focuses on approaches that do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing both doesn&#39;t necessarily mean at the same time. A child can&#39;t be naked at Grandma&#39;s house and be respectful if Grandma objects. But the mom can find times for her child to be naked. She can find clothes that the child finds wearable. She can choose to not visit Grandma until her daughter is old enough to understand the situation well enough and keep her clothes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe approaches offered here are very much about seeing the big picture and being proactive rather than reactive. (Reactive solutions are offered too since parents can&#39;t predict everything and sometimes end up in awkward situations. But the main thrust is to plan ahead to avoid past problems, judge whether the child is capable of what&#39;s needed of them, and hopefully have an exit plan in case they aren&#39;t! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere people often get confused when working with these new ideas is in seeing the child&#39;s want as inflexible and trying to work around that. What helps is being sensitive to the child&#39;s abilities. If a child is adamantly holding onto a rude idea, there&#39;s a bigger, underlying issue. The conventional assumption is the child is bad, rude, untrained and needs fixed. But here people are helped to see beneath the behavior. It could be age. It could be tiredness or hungriness or overwhelmedness. It could be the child doesn&#39;t trust the mom with her needs so feels she needs to fight or dig in her heels to get them met. The child is letting the mom know there&#39;s a problem. It&#39;s up to the mom to change the situation, not change the child to suit the situation (the child wasn&#39;t ready to be in.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat isn&#39;t okay is to continue to allow the child to be rude. The solutions might involve leaving. Or getting out as much as possible. Or looking at the problem from a whole new perspective and finding some outside the box solution the child likes. And definitely recognizing the child may not be ready before planning another similar situation. And when it does come up again, letting the child know what will be expected of them and come up with solutions to avoid past problems. And have an exit plan! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; What I have is enough age and years of experience to know that allowing kids to be little heathens and disregard the feelings of others is a dead end street for those kids later in life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t take years of experience to see that&#39;s true.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can take reading the list for several weeks to see that no one here advocates such a thing. To see that the respectful-of-kids solutions are NOT about ignoring the feelings of others. The goal is finding solutions that are respectful of the child AND respectful of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They are being set up to fail in being productive citizens and careers because they can&#39;t always have their way in the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you think that&#39;s what the list is advocating, you&#39;d best sign off!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we&#39;re advocating but can&#39;t see how the ideas won&#39;t lead there, then ask. Don&#39;t assume the ideas must be leading there and attack them. *Ask* how kids manage to think of others. *Ask* how kids turn out who &quot;get their way&quot;.  (It&#39;s clearer to see it as kids whose needs are treated with respect and met in ways that are respectful of others, kind, doable.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we&#39;re discussing navigating social norms, I do hope you helped your kids take a good amount of time to get a feel for a new place -- to figure out how it works, what its goals are, what it&#39;s purpose is -- before they jump in with snap conclusions and try to fix what they perceive as wrong. It&#39;s potentially embarrassing for them and they&#39;ll be seen as rude.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We ALL have to follow rules and fit in to survive at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The operative word is &quot;at some point.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I&#39;d argue with &quot;have to&quot;. The approach here is &quot;choose to because it makes sense&quot;. The approach here is helping kids make respectful, kind, thoughtful choices in meeting their needs. The approach here is in being respectful of kids&#39; abilities and using their less than stellar choices as feedback on what they&#39;re capable of and on how well we&#39;re communicating. If they&#39;re not capable of being respectful yet, then it&#39;s up to the mom to be the buffer between her child and the world, protecting the child but also protecting the world from the child. And then she can wait and watch before subjecting her child and other people to similar situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As much as I would like it to be different in society it is not now and will never be.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You certainly can. You *choose* not to. You make -- I hope -- decisions weighing the good parts and bad parts of various options.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the goal here. To help kids make better choices. Not to memorize mom&#39;s better choices. But to do what you do and make choices they believe are better. When kids are young, their skills are beginner skills. They don&#39;t have the experience and maturity to make the choices they will as adults. So we act as their partners. Not *making* them comply with right behavior. But being their partner in their journey to thoughtful choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  if a state Dept. of Children&#39;s services wants to take away children it is not the unschooling part they use in court but the behavior of the children which indicates to a &quot;traditional&quot; court they children&#39;s social needs are not being met in their opinion by those parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Behavior will be a red flag. Kids&#39; behavior towards others will be part of the evidence. But kids aren&#39;t being taken away because they&#39;re rude. There&#39;s way more needs to be wrong in the family than just rudeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sounds like fear-based advice. It sounds like something personal that you&#39;re trying to avoid at all costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take the fear out of the equation, then parents have time to help their kids make thoughtful choices. But just because a 4 yo isn&#39;t capable of it yet, isn&#39;t a reason to put on the &quot;I need to make her act right or she&#39;ll be a rude adult&quot; glasses that block out more respectful-of-kids solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":54813758,"authorName":"Liz M","from":"Liz M &lt;corporate7@...&gt;","profile":"silverwolfwhisper","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms","postDate":"1322720562","msgId":64023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJMVTE1NS1XMjgzRUUwNTU1Mjc0OTI1MUU2NTY3MDlCQjEwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PEM2NTc3NEU1LUJGNTktNDI3Ny1CNkI0LTU4NDU0QzgzQTI2OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGphb2NrZyt0MjhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QkxVMTU1LVczODcyRTZCMEIyREYxMUQ2Njc5OUREOUJDQzBAcGh4LmdibD4sPEM2NTc3NEU1LUJGNTktNDI3Ny1CNkI0LTU4NDU0QzgzQTI2OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":63894,"nextInTopic":64024,"prevInTime":64022,"nextInTime":64024,"topicId":63883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, I may be new to the list, but I an certainly not new to unschooling.

I have been homeschooling the unschooling way since 1979. Just because someone uses traditional ways in social norms does not make them a traditional homeschooler. I am one of the first who had the &quot;rebel&quot; attitude and not bragging but if not for some of my work in this area many today would not have the legal right to even choose to unschool. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have two kids that have graduated from college with honors who were unschooled and one in college now. I also have a 16 year old who because of his own perseverance plays on a public high school football team. He is the first one in our state to do that. He made that decision and followed through because he was unschooled and learned how to present himself in a socially acceptable manner to not only the coach, but the principal of the high school, the school board and the superintendent to make his idea acceptable to society. There are certain social rules we have to adhere to if we wish to accomplish the extraordinary which he has done. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am reading from your post is if someone disagrees with YOUR method, then it is wrong.

What I have is enough age and years of experience to know that allowing kids to be little heathens and disregard the feelings of others is a dead end street for those kids later in life. They are being set up to fail in being productive citizens and careers because they can&#39;t always have their way in the real world. We ALL have to follow rules and fit in to survive at some point. As much as I would like it to be different in society it is not now and will never be. I don&#39;t believe in sitting in a classroom, or even sitting up a home to mimic a school, but I do have enough years experience with hundreds of other unschoolers to know if a state Dept. of Children&#39;s services wants to take away children it is not the unschooling part they use in court but the behavior of the children which indicates to a &quot;traditional&quot; court they children&#39;s social needs are not being met in their opinion by those parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\nDate: Fri, 25 Nov 2011 21:26:34 -0700<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n      <br/>\n      <br/>\n      -=-I am very picky about how my children and grandchildren appear in public.

I always wanted my children to be accepted and not feel rejected by their peers and others because of my lack of training. My concern would be if they can&#39;t accept their grandparents requests whom they are to respect, they will reject other norms which will make for a very miserable life later. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLiz, your entire post was very traditional, and I&#39;m sorry it was let through to the list.  You&#39;re still new to Always Learning, and must be new to unschooling.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I agree that children should be encouraged to behave in socially acceptable ways, I don&#39;t think recommending &quot;training&quot; and time-out is good for this list.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease read more about unschooling before advising.  Mainstream advice can be had anywhere.  This list needs to be about what will help people understand unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis part, though, is not so much about unschooling, and I agree with it in part: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I don&#39;t mean this to sound offensive but IMO your husband is not being a good role model for these children. By not taking into account how your parents feel about his lack of cleanliness and clean attire to go out to eat is he is saying that no one matters but him. That is a very narcissistic attitude which if they pick up will cause them trouble all their lives. I don&#39;t like all the rules society has but I abide them because to do otherwise would make me miserable. You can&#39;t have a good career if you won&#39;t follow the rules. People are not going to hire someone who stinks or has a rebel attitude. That might be appropriate as a 13 year old but is very damaging to an adult. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think wearing yesterday&#39;s clothes and a lack of cleanliness is appropriate for thirteen year olds, either.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour details and explanations, though, are quite conservative.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout &quot;a rebel attitude,&quot; there would be no homeschooling and no unschooling.

There are Lots of ways to let young children be children while still maintaining some basic social standards, but it sometimes does entail being willing to suffer a little personal embarrassment in public and be seen as a bit eccentric at times. Not every time, but there are also times when it&#39;s better to say &quot;this really isn&#39;t a good place to take my busy, imaginative little kid just now.&quot; It doesn&#39;t hurt kids to wait a couple years to learn certain kinds of etiquette - if anything they learn more effortlessly if you wait and keep them out of situations they can&#39;t yet handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was little she loved to dress herself and would sometimes do so eccentrically - not half-naked, not ripped or dirty, but she&#39;d put her shoes on backwards and wear odd socks and mis-matched outfits, layer dresses over pants or other dresses. Sometimes she&#39;d want to wear part of a costume in public. I&#39;d let her know when her clothes were going to cause her to get attention of the kind she might not want, and I certainly let her know about rules like the need to wear shoes if she wanted to walk around on the floor somewhere, or if something was over-the-top, but for the most part she could wear what she wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was Embarrassing, sometimes - but usually it was more embarrassing to anticipate. A great many people actually delight in seeing a little child getting to be quirky and silly without really bothering anyone in the process. They&#39;d certainly rather see a happy little kid in a tiara and batman costume who&#39;s relative well behaved than deal with a child wailing in misery while the parents staunchly ignore the &quot;tantrum&quot; and impose on the ears and blood pressure of everyone within hearing distance! Morgan got lots of fond smiles for fairy wings and odd outfits and I learned to be a grown-up lady, hold my head up and say with pride &quot;Yes, she dressed herself today.&quot; My ego, I discovered, does not have to hinge on the clothing choices of a little girl. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;a 4 year old and a 2 year old should not be allowed to choose much of anything<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to adults, toddlers don&#39;t Want to choose much of anything. Really, their knowledge of the world is so scant that the few choices they want to make aren&#39;t that difficult for an thoughtful adult to accommodate. What do they want - to pick out their own clothes? It&#39;s not like they want to borrow the car, and gas money, drive to the store of their choosing and run up the credit card - they&#39;re still little. It&#39;s not a big deal to let a 4yo decide she&#39;d rather wear pants than a dress if that&#39;s a choice she&#39;s in the mood to make. It&#39;s a baby choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nKids learn to make choices by making them, so it&#39;s a Very good idea to let kids make baby choices when they&#39;re babies. That&#39;s how they learn. It Is important to give them information, let them know what is acceptable and appropriate, but it&#39;s just as important to be realistic in that information giving. Wearing mismatched socks isn&#39;t going to get you thrown out of a restaurant, but it might elicit a comment from a strange adult - and to some kids, that comment could be unwanted. To other kids, though, it will be a chance to meet someone new and you&#39;ll get to hear how charming and personable your child is... and, my, he has a big vocabulary for his age! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As for the whining and the ugly talke that is easily stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;It will take time to stop their bad behaviors<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s always interesting to me that people can say and write contradictory things like that about punishment without noticing - and yet I wouldn&#39;t have noticed either when I was still convinced that it was important to be &quot;firm&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids are easy-going and like to please, any kind of parenting looks great. If they aren&#39;t, then discipline can become a massive, ugly battle of wills, sucking the joy out of childhood for parents and children At Best. And at worst it kills children and teens and parents tell each other its the kid who was faulty. Bad seed. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson is a &quot;bad seed&quot; in conventional thinking. When I stepped away from conventional discipline, though, he defied all the dire predictions to become a perfectly lovely young man. What he needed were all the things I&#39;d been told for years I should never give him: time and attention and some choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids need more attention, more time, more care than others. It&#39;s not fair, but nature isn&#39;t homogeneous. People are different. If a child needs more attention, give more attention. If a child wants more help, be more helpful. Having tried more conventional parenting I know that in the longer run it&#39;s Not more work to be more attentive and helpful than it is to argue and fight and punish all day long - and its sooooooo much less stressful! It&#39;s well worth muddling through the awkward transitional time when you know your old parenting skills aren&#39;t very good but you haven&#39;t gotten the hang of the new ones yet. Well, well worth the effort to get your joyful, inquisitive child back. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;better now than later.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You hear that a lot about what kids &quot;need to learn&quot; and its not true at all. It&#39;s most often Better to wait until kids are a little older, with more skills and understanding to put them in difficult situations. Adults forget that going to a restaurant, or waiting in line at the bank, or visiting grandma are difficult situations - but to a little child they can be overwhelming in complexity and when a child is overwhelmed he&#39;s not learning much! That&#39;s the trap of &quot;better now than later&quot; - it sets parents up to see learning happen only in tiny little increments which seem to need continual reinforcement. But waiting a couple years can do the same thing painlessly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt used to be, I didn&#39;t take my daughter to museums or even zoos because she just couldn&#39;t handle the rules. She wanted to run at top speed and climb on everything in sight. So we went places she could run top speed and climb everything in sight. Gradually we stared going to zoos and aquariums - making sure we did very kid-oriented things so she could touch and get physical and that was fine. Last year we started going to art galleries - she was 9. And she was a perfect little art enthusiast looking without touching and asking a million questions at dainty textile and glass exhibits and quirky steam-punkish things full of tempting moving parts. She couldn&#39;t have done that at 6 - so we didn&#39;t take her to art galleries! Ray couldn&#39;t have done it at Mo&#39;s current age - 10 - so we didn&#39;t take him until he was a teenager. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;if the Dept. of Human Services is ever called about them, you stand to lose them if they don&#39;t have respect for adults and act ODD.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a vast overstatement to say a 4yo who whines is &quot;acting ODD&quot;. The people who work for child services see kids who live in imminent danger of very real bodily harm. They&#39;re not worried about a child who doesn&#39;t want to sit still in a restaurant or likes to wear a princess dress to the grocery store. I&#39;ve lived in a hippie commune with no flush toilet and the worst they were concerned about was that the kids each had their own bedrooms (which they did, even those who co-slept and we were discrete about those details). Some child services folks are very anti-spanking, in fact, believing it is a form of abuse (but alas, they&#39;re too busy to police simple abuse much of the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich isn&#39;t to say unschoolers should be cavalier about the way kids behave in public, but there are options beyond &quot;no choices for children&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t mean this to sound offensive but IMO your husband is not being a good role model for these children.

I wonder if he had more options and gentleness if he&#39;d clean up a bit - if he feels like &quot;nothing I do is going to be good enough, anyway, so screw it.&quot; It&#39;s a normal human reaction to rules and authority which seem arbitrary, and a good indication that this family might not want to stay at grandma&#39;s house. It sets everyone up to be antagonistic and that&#39;s not a good way to build relationships.

To give them a choice puts too much responsibility on them at too young of an age. They have no idea what consequence their choices make, so in my opinion until they can accept the consequences for a poor choice most need to be made for them. That is what a parent does is make choices for kids until they can weigh the consequences of a poor choice. To do otherwise is a burden on them as children.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids have been making decisions since they were born.

Right now we are visiting my mom and dad for Thanksgiving.  I am trying to figure out how to balance giving my kids choices and helping my parents be comfortable with my kids.  I remind the kids before we come visit that their grandparents like for them to wear clothes and underwear and diapers while we are here.  I also encourage my son to wear boys clothes when we visit b/c my parents are uncomfortable with him wearing dresses.  At home they are often naked or dressing up in many different clothing combinations.  A lot of times I have let my daughter go out with some unusual outfit that she put together, as long as it is seasonally appropriate (or I will bring sweaters, pants, etc. if I think she might get chilly).  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning my folks wanted to take us out for breakfast and I tried to find Nisa something appropriate to wear.  I let her choose among the clothes I&#39;d packed for her.  She didn&#39;t want to wear those clothes, she wanted to wear a toddler jumpsuit she&#39;d found and has been wearing the past couple days since we&#39;ve been here.  I let her wear it with a peair of pants but my mom didn&#39;t want her to wear it and told her to pick something else.  She took a long time trying to choose, and none of her choices were appropriate.  I told my parents they should go ahead without her since she couldn&#39;t pick something to wear.

I know that my parents have some issues with some of the things my kids do or get to choose.  They pretty much think my kids are spoiled and my dad especially has a hard time being with them because they don&#39;t obey him the way he is used to.

He went to breakfast this morning without showering, in the clothes he wore yesterday.  He did brush his teeth and wash his face.

She did not want to do what was expected of her to go to breakfast (brush her hair, change into different clothes) and was very upset when I suggested she just not go.  Some days I am very good at helping her do these kinds of things without a problem, and other days, like today, I am not as nice as I usually am.

We did that when Mo was little, even though George&#39;s mom is really very easy-going and undemanding because her house was impossible to child-proof for any kind of short stay. She hadn&#39;t had a toddler in almost thirty years! So it was easier to stay elsewhere than spend a week keeping my busy climbing wonder-child out of alllllll grandma&#39;s books and knick-knacks and art and liquor and assorted hoo-haa. Grandma has a Wonderful house to visit with an 8yo - a marvelous museum house! but not such a good fit for a little kid. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to keep in mind that your parents haven&#39;t had toddlers in years, maybe decades. They don&#39;t remember how much work it can be to get kids dressed and fed and keep them dressed and presentable. They don&#39;t remember how much work it is to remind kids over and over to be pleasant and sweet and say &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;yes sir&quot; - they&#39;ve forgotten, if they ever knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe you weren&#39;t the handful your kids are! Some kids are more high-energy and strong willed than others, and its shocking to people who didn&#39;t have such intense kids of their own - and they think its a parenting difference, not thinking about the fact that plenty of &quot;problem children&quot; come from high-discipline homes. I&#39;m not saying to let your kids run wild and say &quot;it&#39;s who they are&quot;, I&#39;m saying your mom&#39;s expectations sound totally unreasonable for a pair of high-energy toddlers. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;  I remind the kids before we come visit that their grandparents like for them to wear clothes and underwear and diapers while we are here.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since they&#39;re 4 and 2, that reminder doesn&#39;t last very long. You can expect to remind them a dozen times a day while you&#39;re visiting - this is Grandma&#39;s house, and things are different here, I&#39;m sorry. That may make visiting very stressful for a few years - and maybe not worth the hassle if it leads to kids not liking their grandparents when waiting a couple years would solve a lot of issues. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be better to stay in a hotel or with friends and meet in &quot;neutral territory&quot; - family buffet style restaurants, but also places like playgrounds where the kids can be expected to be dressed more casually, and expected to get dirty, but it&#39;s also the sort of place your Kids will expect to wear clothing... since I assume you don&#39;t take them to the playground in the buff most of the time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My husband, on the other hand, does not care much about appearances and social norms.  He went to breakfast this morning without showering, in the clothes he wore yesterday. <br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can tell your mom &quot;they&#39;re their father&#39;s child&quot; in some light, gentle way. Maybe not if it could get ugly. But its something to think about when you&#39;re pushing and pushing and pushing against your mom. She&#39;s likely pushing your kids harder because their dad isn&#39;t going to toe the line - and He&#39;s likely to be more resistant at the same time so the kids are caught in the middle. Ouch. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My parents do not like how my kids talk to us (they can be pretty demanding, although they usually will rephrase a demand if I suggest they ask me more nicely next time), don&#39;t like that they whine and cry about little things frequently (not sure how to help the kids with this but I see it as a problem too), and don&#39;t like that they don&#39;t listen and obey right away.  I would like to find ways to help them not only for my parents but for myself in some of these areas.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;re 4 and 2. Courtesy is important, but at 4 and 2, they depend on you to do the social smoothing for them. You say please and thank you, say what they will eventually say for themselves and don&#39;t make a fuss about it. As they get older, that&#39;s something to talk about more, but a 4yo can&#39;t be counted on to use what social graces she has under any kind of stress at all - and being out of her own home is Lots of stress! If that&#39;s not enough for your mom, then visits need to be short so everyone&#39;s not miserable - that&#39;s another kind of courtesy, knowing when to stay home and not impose yourself on others. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;don&#39;t like that they whine and cry about little things frequently (not sure how to help the kids with this but I see it as a problem too)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s kind of a different topic, but if they&#39;re whining and crying you&#39;re not giving them prompt enough attention. And if you&#39;re tied up with visiting relatives, its going to be hard for you to give them prompt enough attention while also visiting. Can you and your husband trade off with looking after the kids while the other visits? Sometimes that works, but it could be better to curtail visits for awhile until the kids are less needy. <br/>\n<br/>\nFWIW, kids who are spanked whine and cry, too - that&#39;s not a &quot;discipline&quot; issue its a &quot;child needs attention&quot; issue. Kids do what Works to get your attention whether its whine or &quot;get in trouble&quot; - and while its true you can beat them out of whining if you hit hard enough and long enough, they&#39;ll Still find ways to get your attention, even if that attention is in the form of another beating.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the problem is one I&#39;ve created of giving my kids too much choice in the beginning, not looking enough at the particulars of the situation; and now my kids, especially my daughter, expect to always have things exactly how they want, without regard to others.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s 4 - it&#39;s perfectly normal for a 4yo to want exactly what she wants when she wants it and be hugely disappointed when that&#39;s not what happens. It&#39;s part of being little for a whoooole lot of kids. Maybe you weren&#39;t that emotional as a child so you can&#39;t relate, but it&#39;s not out of the ordinary. It&#39;s perfectly normal for anyone of any age to have little regard for others&#39; feelings if their needs aren&#39;t being met well enough - it&#39;s a big shopping day in the US, today, and I guarantee you there will be plenty of adults acting like 4yos when some sale item sells out before they get to it! Including adults who were &quot;raised right&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;ve let your mom&#39;s criticism get too far under your skin. Yes, look for ways to help your kids get along with your mom, but consider that her expectations may be Vastly too high for a 4yo, much less a 2yo. It may be better to keep contact to &quot;safe&quot; situations where your kids can be kids for a few years, so that they have a chance to like your parents and not resent them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Maybe my tone of voice is the problem, as I feel I am bullying them rather than offering choices when I tell my daughter she can either wear the dresses I&#39;ve picked for her or not go.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>********************<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re concerned your tone is bullying, it probably is. If you&#39;re concerned you&#39;re bullying your child, it&#39;s time (past time) to look for a completely different way of approaching the situation. Maybe decide it&#39;s okay that she not go and you don&#39;t need to make an issue of it. Maybe it would be better to stand up to your mother in some way, say &quot;Oh, mom, you&#39;re not going to be kicked out of society because of what a 4yo is wearing&quot; and put your daughter in the car. Maybe stand up to mom and say &quot;have a good time! this isn&#39;t going to work today, sorry!&quot; and smile and put on a dvd. Maybe put on some fairy wings and a tiara so mom has something Else to seethe about ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t set your kids up to bear the brunt of your parents&#39; displeasure, set them up to like their grandparents as much as possible - it may not be possible for them to like their grandparents, but do what you can to help them have an okay relationship. If grandma can&#39;t like them until they&#39;re properly behaved, don&#39;t set everyone up to fail. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] helping little ones navigate social norms","postDate":"1322240761","msgId":63885,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVFQjUxMTIzLUI5RUQtNDc0NS05RkU5LTA0NTk2QUNDOEQ5MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjIyMzkzMDQuNjMxOTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGphb2NrZyt0MjhrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTMyMjIzOTMwNC42MzE5Ni5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODE1MDIubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63884,"nextInTopic":63886,"prevInTime":63884,"nextInTime":63886,"topicId":63883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Plus I explained to my kids that people can think I am not taking care of them if they are looking dirty and unkempt. -=- I used to remind my kids of that,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1523821887\">-=-Plus I explained to my kids that people can think I am not taking care of them if they are looking dirty and unkempt. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to remind my kids of that, too.

Right now we are visiting my mom and dad for Thanksgiving.  I am trying to figure out how to balance giving my kids choices and helping my parents be comfortable with my kids.  I remind the kids before we come visit that their grandparents like for them to wear clothes and underwear and diapers while we are here.  I also encourage my son to wear boys clothes when we visit b/c my parents are uncomfortable with him wearing dresses.  At home they are often naked or dressing up in many different clothing combinations.

I let her choose among the clothes I&#39;d packed for her.  She didn&#39;t want to wear those clothes, she wanted to wear a toddler jumpsuit she&#39;d found and has been wearing the past couple days since we&#39;ve been here.  I let her wear it with a peair of pants but my mom didn&#39;t want her to wear it and told her to pick something else.  She took a long time trying to choose, and none of her choices were appropriate.  I told my parents they should go ahead without her since she couldn&#39;t pick something to wear.  She kept insisting that she be allowed to wear one dress on top of another dress, which did look kind of silly.

I don&#39;t really care when he does these things, but my parents have complained before about him being smelly and have asked him to wear deodorant when he is here, which he refuses to do.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know my daughter is upset with me this morning, and has been kind of upset with me most of the time we&#39;ve been here because I&#39;ve been chasing her around trying to get her underwear on and making sure she is appropriate when we are here.  She did not want to do what was expected of her to go to breakfast (brush her hair, change into different clothes) and was very upset when I suggested she just not go.  Some days I am very good at helping her do these kinds of things without a problem, and other days, like today, I am not as nice as I usually am.  I think I feel a lot of pressure to get her to do certain things while we are here, and the stress makes me less kind.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents do not like how my kids talk to us (they can be pretty demanding, although they usually will rephrase a demand if I suggest they ask me more nicely next time), don&#39;t like that they whine and cry about little things frequently (not sure how to help the kids with this but I see it as a problem too), and don&#39;t like that they don&#39;t listen and obey right away.  I would like to find ways to help them not only for my parents but for myself in some of these areas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the problem is one I&#39;ve created of giving my kids too much choice in the beginning, not looking enough at the particulars of the situation; and now my kids, especially my daughter, expect to always have things exactly how they want, without regard to others.  This could be more because they are so young, but I think my behavior has also contributed.  I am looking for help on how to deal with this situation better next time, and also how to generally shift away from them feeling entitled to whatever they want without regard for others.  What kinds of suggestions can I give my kids that they would be more willing to hear?  Maybe my tone of voice is the problem, as I feel I am bullying them rather than offering choices when I tell my daughter she can either wear the dresses I&#39;ve picked for her or not go.  I also feel that I should be working harder to convince her to go because it would mean a lot to her grandparents, rather than giving her the choice not to go if she doesn&#39;t want to wear the right clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot, and happy 10th anniversary (yesterday) to the list!<br/>\n<br/>\nLydia Koltai</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64045,"nextTopicId":64079}}
