I do remember helping with dishes, putting stuff away in my room, doing planting in springtime....and I remember it all with a smile on my face.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest brother is now 22, 18 years younger than me, and I never lived in the house while he was alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe still lives at home. His best &quot;friends&quot; are my mom and his dad. They sit and have challenging political discussions, and take on VERY big questions and debate them.  He takes my 91 year old grandfather to every Princteon U. home basketball game and football game, he translates basketball games that are &quot;away&quot; and on the radio to my granddad, since he is deaf and cannot hear them.<br/>\n<br/>\nEVERYONE in the family, even I have questioned why this extremely bright kid is still at home....still not hanging out with friends of his own age etc.  BUT you know what????  I finally get it.  He was home tutored from 8-12th grade.  He has never been told to do a chore that I know of, and yet he has always offered his help eagerly and tackels big projects at the house that no one else would want to do.  He volunteers at my now deceased grandmother&#39;s church to take care of loose ends.  He does this because it brings him joy to continue the service my grandmother provided...it has never been asked for nor implied that he should be doing this.  What I finally GET is that he was allowed to blossom the way HE chose.  He has been &quot;held&quot; by his parents and nourished and watered when needed, when asked BY him.  NEVER have they put any &quot;expectation&quot; on him, and he is a VERY bright guy with Ivy- league educated parents, grandparents, uncles, brother etc.  I mention this because there certainly is a lot of unspoken &quot;pressure&quot; with the long list of relatives accomplishments.  He is the most relaxed and CONTENT person I know, and yet he owns nothing but the clothes on his back and an IPOD!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why I am relating this whole thing, except that it IS looked upon as strange in our society to like our parents and want to be with them when we are teens and older.  WHY?  I think this should really be examined.  Just like when people looked at me like I had 2 heads when I was still nursing my 3 year olds (they self weaned at 3 1/2), it wasn&#39;t like they would nurse into college!!  Humans grow up without our help, this is for sure.  Just like they walked and talked without teaching, so they wean without forcing, they develop their own identities at their own pace and eventually become &quot;independent&quot; of us.  And no adult would think it is healthy for the &quot;independent&quot; adult child to not want to be with their parents.........they would find it dysfunctional in some way probably.  But these same people want the teens to not want to have anything to do with their parents?  It is these kids that probably (I&#39;ve done no research on this, I am guessing here) have the most problems, make the bigger mistakes, take the wrong turns.  A parent serves as a compass, but you have to have that compass in hand in order to use it, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for this discussion!<br/>\nKelley<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/\">http://sandandstardust.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Childhood is a journey, not a race.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":319119053,"authorName":"purple_flygirl","from":"&quot;purple_flygirl&quot; &lt;purple_flygirl@...&gt;","profile":"purple_flygirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: collateral punishment / cleaning house","postDate":"1206389009","msgId":33561,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZzOTFlaCttbDR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU3ODcyNjQ4LUE2MTMtNDRCMi1BMDcyLUQ4NjY2REZFREQwOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":33558,"nextInTopic":33588,"prevInTime":33560,"nextInTime":33562,"topicId":33419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"--Thank you Sandra/-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1801165446\">--Thank you Sandra/-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I have 4 daughters and I was sure I was doing it differently -- I  <br/>\n&gt; have homeschooled, and thought I had been more purposeful about my  <br/>\n&gt; relationship with them.

It goes beyond that though, the father is, <br/>\nin my opinion, extremely emotionally abusive and controlling.  <br/>\nChamille has been viewed as a threat to his control over his <br/>\ndaughter, and in his twisted thinking, has to be removed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has done a fabulous job of this in many many subtle and not so <br/>\nsubtle ways.  Currently Chamille can only see this friend at her <br/>\nhouse on the father&#39;s conditions, which involve him being in the same <br/>\nroom as them at all times, probably to monitor conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe father has done an amazing job of completely brainwashing and <br/>\neliminating resistance to his ultimate control over his children.  <br/>\nThey do NOT defy him.  He punishes severly and dangles carrots.  The <br/>\nkids aren&#39;t allowed out of the house, ever, except when he needs <br/>\nsomething from the store, a couple blocks away, and sends them to <br/>\npick it up.  He moved to a tiny apartment across the street from the <br/>\nschools they go to, to ensure that they never go any where except <br/>\nschool and home.  He has a job that makes sure that he is there when <br/>\nthey are.  He keeps tabs on all phone calls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey used to live across the street, and he used to let his kids play <br/>\noutside with Chamille, this is how they really got to know each other <br/>\nand become really good friends.  Somewhere along the way, he decided <br/>\nthat Chamille was a really bad influence on his daughter and started <br/>\neliminating availability to the point where it is pretty much non-<br/>\nexistent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really yucky and hurtful.  I&#39;m really uncomfortable with <br/>\nChamille going over to their house, yet I&#39;ve allowed Chamille to <br/>\ndecide for herself what she is willing to put up with and be her <br/>\ncrying shoulder for all the pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, last night after experiencing yet another let down from this <br/>\nrelationship, she realized, that the dad was never going to let her <br/>\nhave a relationship with her friend.  There was never going to be a <br/>\ntime that he was going to allow his daughter to come over or DO <br/>\nanything.  The current excuse was just that, the current excuse and <br/>\nthe next time, there will be another one, and another, and another.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the video store to get some movies and sat in the car for <br/>\na long time talking about it.  Chamille said that he won.  My <br/>\nresponse was, are you kidding me?  He hasn&#39;t won anything, he&#39;s lost <br/>\neverything.  Even if it were a contest, the clear winner would be <br/>\nher, since she has a family that cares, and she is free to walk away <br/>\nand find other friends.  The losers are him and his kids.  If his <br/>\nchildren survive to adulthood, since suicide could be likely, they <br/>\nwill not have a relationship with their father and they will leave <br/>\nfor good.  These are clear &quot;at risk&quot; kids.  Several scenarios could <br/>\nplay out, but none of them any good for anyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday, she told her friend that she wasn&#39;t going to go over to <br/>\nher house because her father is mean and she is uncomfortable around <br/>\nhim because of his meanness.  She will probably never see this friend <br/>\nagain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could&#39;ve ended this friendship a long time ago by not allowing <br/>\nChamille to go over to their house, but I didn&#39;t because Chamille <br/>\nreally does very much care for this person.  She has endured a lot of <br/>\npain and suffering from it, she discovered for herself what her <br/>\nboundary was with this person.  That is a valuable life skill to <br/>\nhave, to know where that boundary is with people, how much you are <br/>\nwilling to put up with to experience the &quot;good&quot; parts, and to KNOW <br/>\nthat you have options and choices.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":156312427,"authorName":"Shannon Foust","from":"Shannon Foust &lt;soldout641@...&gt;","profile":"soldout641","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: collateral punishment / cleaning house","postDate":"1206217122","msgId":33485,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNTIxMC40MTIzNi5xbUB3ZWI1MDMwMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEU5RTBCOUE3LUE4RUYtNDM5MC05RjQ5LTE5MDI2RDIwQ0NDQ0BlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":33461,"nextInTopic":33506,"prevInTime":33484,"nextInTime":33486,"topicId":33419,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Emily - that sounds great too, especially the part about modeling joy in doing it, and letting go of expectations that they either must help, or that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-938734253\">Thanks Emily - that sounds great too, especially the part about modeling joy in doing it, and letting go of expectations that they either must help, or that they should want to help.

Too much of that kind of speech <br/>\nfrom parents causes kids to tune them out and stop listening, just as my <br/>\nfriends did with their parents. The kids are collectively rolling their eyes <br/>\nand shrugging their shoulders and thinking that the noise that comes out of <br/>\ntheir parents&#39; mouths can be largely ignored, a small nuisance they have to <br/>\nput up with. That is what I meant by futile.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a genuine question; my friends&#39; moms weren&#39;t expecting their kids <br/>\nto answer. &quot;Well gosh, I guess I can&#39;t be more like Robyn because I&#39;m me not <br/>\nher, and I have my own strengths and weaknesses that are all mine not hers, <br/>\nbut she&#39;s still my friend despite all this unpleasant comparing going on.&quot; <br/>\nIt was just a round about way of being critical and unacceptant and living <br/>\nin a schooly mindset (I was head of my class every year and diligent, so I <br/>\nwas a school success story). My friends&#39; parents had good intentions, I dare <br/>\nsay. They probably wanted to inspire their daughters - but it didn&#39;t have <br/>\nthe intended effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intention as a mindful parent is to try and speak with conciousness of <br/>\nthe content of my words, and also to be straightforward when what I am doing <br/>\nis in the broader realm of correcting Jayn&#39;s behavior (which is not a good <br/>\nway to put it, but I&#39;m a bit tired right this moment), or alerting her to <br/>\nanother better choice.  If I want Jayn to take what I say to heart, the onus <br/>\nis on me to say things worth listening to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis includes owning my own feelings. For example, looking back now I <br/>\nsuspect that this &quot;Why can&#39;t you....&quot;  collection of phrases that came from <br/>\nmy and my friends&#39; parents was an expression of their frustration. Perhaps <br/>\nthey had expectations that were blinding them.

The other parent punishes their child by  <br/>\ncanceling an activity or play date with my child effectively  <br/>\npunishing him right along with her son - often at the very last minute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m assuming that when you ended the friendship, Holly was on board  <br/>\nwith not maintaining her friendship with the daughter.   But how do  <br/>\nyou handle it when your child really wants to maintain the friendship  <br/>\nwith the other child?  I&#39;ve talked to my son a lot about it and tried  <br/>\nto prepare him for the possibility that the agreed upon plans might  <br/>\nnot happen, but that just feels like a yucky way to be in a  <br/>\nfriendship, always on pins and needles.  Although my son is prepared,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s still an anxiety in him that his friend is going to make a  <br/>\nwrong move and &quot;bamm&quot; the play date is over or a future event is  <br/>\ncancelled.  I&#39;ve talked with the mother, but she just thinks she has  <br/>\nto do what&#39;s right for her family regardless of the collateral  <br/>\ndamage.  Personally, I would be fine with ending the whole friendship  <br/>\nas you did, but with respect for my son, I&#39;m wanting to see some  <br/>\nother options.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any thoughts on how you or others have handled these type  <br/>\nof situations.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was pretty cranky too, and asked me to talk to the mom (about  <br/>\nthat and other things).  One day when Holly was cancelled out on  <br/>\nabout the toilet (the prime example), I said &quot;If Holly comes over and  <br/>\ncleans the toilet, then can they go?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer was something like &quot;No, I don&#39;t want Holly to clean the  <br/>\ntoilet, I want Sierra to do what I tell her to do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it wasn&#39;t about the toilet being clean.  It was about a mom who  <br/>\nliked to put a reward out on a string and then yank it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that day, the mom told the daughter while she was asleep to clean  <br/>\nthe toilet or she couldn&#39;t go.  Eight hours passed.  The mom works on  <br/>\nthe computer and is on IM all day.  The daughter has a phone, e-mail,  <br/>\nmyspace.  The mom could&#39;ve asked or reminded her.  The daughter had  <br/>\nfallen back to sleep and forgotten about the request, if she ever  <br/>\nreally heard it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Holly was deprived of something she wanted to do.  I said that  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t fair to Holly, and the other mom said that&#39;s what she gets for  <br/>\nhaving a friend who doesn&#39;t listen to her mom.  So it was clarified  <br/>\nfor me that Holly DID deserve to be punished, for not picking better  <br/>\nfriends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was another family when Holly was four, five, six--across the  <br/>\nstreet--who did the same thing a lot.  If the daughter did something  <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t like while Holly was over, they&#39;d say &quot;Holly has to go  <br/>\nhome now.&quot;  They punished her by removing Holly, as though Holly were  <br/>\nan inanimate object.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33566,"nextTopicId":33452}}
