He definitely has his own unique <br/>\nperspective on unschooling. He&#39;s from Iran - such a different culture <br/>\nthan the one we live in. So he had to make two HUGE shifts, over the <br/>\nyears. First to a Southern California American culture and then to <br/>\nradical unschooling. If you think radical unschooling is a shift for <br/>\nwesterners, think about what an incredible shift it is for someone who <br/>\ncomes from such a paternalistic, authoritarian, traditional, and <br/>\nsometimes quite brutal and oppressive cultural background. His schooling <br/>\nwas brutal by our worst public school standards. It was 6 days per week, <br/>\nmuch longer school days. The typical educational method involved <br/>\nassigning work to be done at home and then presented in front of the <br/>\nclass. Those whose presentations were not adequate were shamed and <br/>\nhumiliated and physically punished. For example, the teacher would weave <br/>\na pencil between a child&#39;s fingers and, with the hand flat on the desk, <br/>\nthe teacher would hit their hand. The teacher would put rice on the <br/>\nfloor and make the child kneel on it with bare knees, for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is  kind and gentle and sweet. He was raised in what I&#39;d call <br/>\na very enlightened family. He came to this country at 23 years old, <br/>\nthough, so he grew up with all that stuff. Children were expected to <br/>\njump when told to jump and to be extremely obedient - obedience is a <br/>\nvery highly valued trait in that culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has adjusted to unschooling, never really fully &quot;getting it&quot; but <br/>\nknowing that our kids were doing well. Over time, he&#39;s been pretty happy <br/>\nwith it. Most definitely he&#39;s happy with the kinds of relationships we <br/>\nhave with our kids which is VERY different than any adult-child <br/>\nrelationships he&#39;d ever known. He&#39;s still a little taken aback with how <br/>\nindependent our kids are and how self-confident they are. He still <br/>\nsometimes thinks they should &quot;ask permission&quot; more often. Rosie, who is <br/>\n18, has planned a trip with her boyfriend and other friends to go visit <br/>\nsomeone two states away - they&#39;ll be gone about 2 weeks. They&#39;re very <br/>\nresponsible and are carefully making plans. Great kids. But he was <br/>\nirritated that she told us they were going instead of asking if she <br/>\ncould go. These kinds of irritations pop up for him - mostly it has to <br/>\ndo with this kind of thing - them making their own (big) plans. Partly <br/>\nthis is his reaction to them growing up, too. In Iran, as long as girls <br/>\naren&#39;t married, while they still live at home, they are completely under <br/>\nthe thumb of their father. They wouldn&#39;t dream of making plans without <br/>\ngetting his approval first.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - each step of the way, as we&#39;ve moved from babies to toddlers to <br/>\nmid-age children to teens to young adults, there have been new <br/>\nchallenges for him. It hasn&#39;t always been easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - like Sandra - I cringe a little thinking of what my husband MIGHT <br/>\nsay, but it will be good for other dads to hear his concerns and how <br/>\nthey&#39;ve evaporated (again and again). It&#39;ll probably be good for my <br/>\nhusband, too. He doesn&#39;t spend much time thinking about any of this <br/>\nstuff - it&#39;ll help him to look back over the years and get some perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Dads Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: an online chat and a youtube note","postDate":"1241625277","msgId":44705,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBMTczODBELTgzNjUtNEI2NC1BMTYzLUJEQTJGODJFRTIxMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjIuMTQ3NzcucW1Ad2ViODE1MDYubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd0czQ4dSticjNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTMyMi4xNDc3Ny5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":44699,"nextInTopic":44707,"prevInTime":44704,"nextInTime":44706,"topicId":44661,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- Sandra has a great effect in husbands.

Although he didn&#39;t talk  <br/>\nabout it much on the list, he was working and being house-husband and  <br/>\ntaking care of his two boys and his wife, who was bedridden with  <br/>\nmental illness, but he kept on taking care of her and dealing with her  <br/>\nparents who acted like (and said!) there was nothing wrong with her,  <br/>\nshe was fine.   He wanted to get unschooling quickly, and he did.  He  <br/>\nhelped others get it too, by being willing to share his changing  <br/>\nthoughts in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey moved from the small midwestern home in which they had grown up  <br/>\nto a mountainous western place (not near me, unfortunately) and I  <br/>\nstill hear from him occasionally.
