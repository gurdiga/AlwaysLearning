We actually<br/>\nlive in a world that is safer than it has ever been throughout history.  You<br/>\nmight want to check your facts on that one.  Think Crusades, think 1700&#39;s<br/>\nAmerica, think biblical times.  We are much safer than we would have been<br/>\nthen.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. <br/>\nThere are times and places in history, when people could NOT imagine living in a city without walls for protection. They would have been totally AMAZED at the level of peace and prosperity we enjoy today. think feudal England for example, and read Ken Follets &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; for a good lesson in history and violence of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n<br/>\n &quot;There is no way to <br/>\npeace.
