They just know that we<br/>\nhomeschool and for now thats all they need to know about how we CHOOSE to<br/>\neducate our children.  I want to live a rich, full, fun life with my family<br/>\nand I have made the choice to do that and unschooling is the way to do<br/>\nthat.  Some friends who know that I have started unschooling don&#39;t say<br/>\nanything about it but I know they don&#39;t truly get it.
