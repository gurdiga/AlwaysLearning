And <br/>\nit&#39;s a vast difference.  They are not two sides of the same coin.   They&#39;re <br/>\nnot even made of the same metal.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd I was thinking that one of the problems with &quot;chores&quot; is that the word  <br/>\nhas the connotation of being something that&#39;s not fun, something that involves  <br/>\nassigned drudgery.  When I say &quot;my kids don&#39;t have chores,&quot; some people  <br/>\nhearing it probably fill in their own &quot;chore list,&quot; and so assume they never,  <br/>\never pick up their laundry or make their beds or clean their rooms or put dishes  <br/>\nin the sink, or whatever all.  That&#39;s not what it means.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd maybe so with art.  If people say &quot;Do you like art?&quot; or &quot;Are you  <br/>\nartistic?&quot; the listener fills in whatever he thinks of &quot;art&quot; as being.  And  if it&#39;s <br/>\nlimited to what&#39;s taught in school (either studio or  appreciation/history), a <br/>\nperson (such as myself) who has never painted in oils,  can&#39;t draw a <br/>\nrecognizeable person, and isn&#39;t a sculptor could easily say &quot;no&quot; to  the latter, and <br/>\nif the very question caused inner turmoil, &quot;no&quot; the the  former.<br/>\n <br/>\nBummer.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen people set tables and put the food on in really artistic  ways.  <br/>\n(Very occasionally it was me, but not enough to &quot;count.&quot;)<br/>\n <br/>\nSome people can arrange their houses, or flowers, or clothes in the closet,  <br/>\nor magazines on a table, in really striking ways, never before done, without  <br/>\nworking really hard, sketching plans, or consulting books. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nThere must&#39;ve been a car show here this weekend, because we saw several  <br/>\nolder (40&#39;s) cars, not exactly restored historically, but neither were they  <br/>\nchopped up low-riders.  They were operational art, driving around on real  roads.<br/>\n <br/>\nA friend of mine has medieval horse barding and braids her horse and  dresses <br/>\nit up sometimes, and rides it in costume.  It&#39;s a little like  playing <br/>\nBarbies, but way bigger. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve been messing with my garden, and moving plants and putting things in  <br/>\nfrom seed, and pulling selected things out.  Many are more artistic than I  am, <br/>\nbut I&#39;m having fun anyway.<br/>\n <br/>\nHow about other everyday uses of aesthetically pleasing arrangements of  <br/>\nthings?  <br/>\nWhat are the limits?  Does it need to be just visual?  What  is art to the <br/>\nblind?  <br/>\n <br/>\nHow about those beds at furniture and bedding stores, all jacked up off the  <br/>\nground with twelve pillows and three coverlets and sheets that match dust  <br/>\nruffles?   Art.   <br/>\n <br/>\nAnd about that English thing, while I&#39;m on it.  The word &quot;artificial&quot;  has to <br/>\ndo with art, and a few hundred years ago it was a huge compliment to say  <br/>\nthat something was &quot;artificial.&quot;  If someone could make a rose out of metal  or <br/>\nplaster and have it look like a real rose, others were mightily impressed and  <br/>\npraised its artificiality.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n_artifice_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=artifice)\">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=artifice)</a>   <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=artifice)\">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=artifice)</a>   <br/>\n1534, &quot;workmanship,&quot; from M.Fr. artifice &quot;skill, cunning,&quot; from L. artificium <br/>\n&quot;making by art, craft,&quot; from artifex (gen. artificis) &quot;craftsman, artist,&quot; <br/>\nfrom ars &quot;art&quot; (see _art_ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=art)\">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=art)</a>  (n.)) <br/>\n+ facere &quot;do&quot; (see _factitious_ <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=factitious)\">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=factitious)</a> ).
