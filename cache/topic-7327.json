I also didn&#39;t want to give the <br/>\nteacher&#39;s union any ammunition against homeschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe did little towards getting better at reading and writing, and it didn&#39;t <br/>\ncome up again by the time school started the next year.  About mid-year, he <br/>\nstarted again saying that he wanted to try it.  We told him he could, but <br/>\nthat he had to do school-at-home for a month first.  I set up a schedule as <br/>\nmuch like school as I could.  At first he really got into it, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nlong before we were fighting about it.  (I know, I should have just backed <br/>\noff then.)  I finally decided that it was up to him to decide whether he <br/>\nwas ready for high school (grade 9).  At that point his academic skills <br/>\nwere only slightly better.  He kept me on edge till the very end of summer <br/>\nbefore deciding he wouldn&#39;t go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy granddaughter insisted this winter that she wanted to try school, so my <br/>\ndaughter set up a trial.  She went to grade 2 for a week.  Her take on <br/>\nschool?  Her teacher was mean, and it was boring.  She liked recess and <br/>\nlunch, but not well enough to keep going.  My daughter told her that she <br/>\ncould call home if she wasn&#39;t happy there, but the teacher wouldn&#39;t let <br/>\nher.  Even when she brought a note saying that she should be allowed to <br/>\ncall, the teacher wouldn&#39;t let her.  This woman was actually the perfect <br/>\nteacher for a kid that you hope will choose homeschooling.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt;wondering what she thinks she needs from school? She does play with lots of<br/>\n&gt;schooled kids and this may be the source of her curiousity. Part of me is<br/>\n&gt;game for trying, another part says once she starts she may never come back<br/>\n&gt;home to us. And I bet her brother will want to try too, he would be K and I<br/>\n&gt;really want him to stay home. He is one of those big moving boys, he would<br/>\n&gt;find himself constantly remindered to sit and be quiet. He also does not<br/>\n&gt;seperate well from me unless he decides to go somewhere. Just as we think<br/>\n&gt;all is well, change again. I have 10 weeks or so to work this issue through.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both kids may decide not to go when the time comes, but even if they go, it <br/>\nisn&#39;t likely to hold their interest for long if they have interesting <br/>\nthings to do at home and friends to interact with when they want to.<br/>\nAnother thing to consider is whether they&#39;re just wanting to ride the <br/>\nschool bus, or get a bunch of school supplies.

I&#39;m guessing her<br/>\nfriends who go to school tell her the fun stuff that happens during the<br/>\nfifteen minute recess but don&#39;t talk that much about what goes on the<br/>\nrest of the time.   Does she know about homework and having to keep quiet<br/>\nand not being able to dye her hair blue?( One of Dylan&#39;s friends was sent<br/>\nhome this year because she dyed the tips of her blond hair blue.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is maybe no way you can make her aware of these things without it<br/>\nseeming like a kind of brainwashing, but then she&#39;ll get that anyway if<br/>\nshe goes to school, just in a different fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there one little friend she&#39;s especially close with and would like<br/>\nmore time with? <br/>\nSummer vacation might take care of that.  Or maybe she could join<br/>\nsomething else the friend is in, gymnastics or campfire or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t remember where or when I read it, maybe on a list somewhere but a<br/>\nmother equated school with a toxic waste dump.  She said she wouldn&#39;t let<br/>\nher kid play at the one, so why would she let her play at the other?  <br/>\nMaybe not everyone feels school is as bad as a toxic waste dump, but if<br/>\nwe didn&#39;t all have our suspicions, we wouldn&#39;t have bothered to keep our<br/>\nkids out in the first place. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there not enough going on at home that&#39;s interesting to her?  I<br/>\nremember we had to try so hard during the summer my dad was sick, to find<br/>\nand do interesting things, because we were so busy caring for him.   I<br/>\nknow it was a hard summer for Dylan, because we just couldn&#39;t take off<br/>\nand go like we usually can.   If you do a lot of wonderful things this<br/>\nsummer and listen to her ideas about what other wonderful things she&#39;d<br/>\nlike to do when summer&#39;s over, maybe home is where she&#39;ll want to be.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI know you&#39;ve said she sometimes has conflicts with her brother, does she<br/>\nfeel like school would be an easy way to get a break from him?  Could she<br/>\nbe using the school idea to get more of your attention if she feels like<br/>\ntoo much of it is going to little brother?   Is something happening at<br/>\nhome that she&#39;d like to get away from?

I too wondered why they would want to go. So, I asked, of course fearing the same things as you. But their answers surprised me. My oldest dd, 11 at the time, told me she just wondered what it was like. She thought she might have fun there. My youngest dd, 8 at the time, told me that she would like to make more friends and that school is fun, so it seemed like a great place to make friends. While I always try to let my children be a part of their education, I didn&#39;t feel that they were able to make a choice like this one. Perhaps many of you will disagree with this. But I felt that this was one decision they didn&#39;t have the ability to choose. It was mine and my dh who decided they should not go. But I did tell them about school. We told them what kids do in school all day. We also told them that we valued their opinions, but that in this case we felt that we were better able to make this choice for them. They were very ok with it. Neither one of them even seemed to care that we had said no. They both just said, ok, and went off and played. At the end of this school year, we had our annual evaluation, done by a certified teacher. It went very well. We met the teacher at the school she works, in her classroom. She was very nice and friendly with all of us. And she seemed very positive about homeschoolers. My oldest dd told me that she was so worried that the teacher would make her stay, and that she would have to go to school. Hmmmm, quite a change in just 1 year. My youngest dd, told me that she never wanted to have a teacher do an evaluation again, she said she couldn&#39;t believe that kids had to go to that place and stay all day, every day. She said it felt like she was in a prison or hospital. She said that she felt very sorry for those kids in the ps. Again, I was surprised at what 1 year did. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that homeschool kids, perhaps not all, wonder at some time, what it would be like. They know that alot of kids go away to school. So they think there might be something they are missing. See, homeschooled kids, especially Unschooled kids, think school is fun. They think learning is an enjoyable thing. It&#39;s hard for them to imagine that there are kids who don&#39;t want to learn, that hate school. <br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO I would say don&#39;t let your daughter experiment with this. If you truly feel that you are doing the best thing for her, by homeschooling/unschooling, then you should talk to her. See if you can find out why she wants to go. Perhaps it&#39;s just curiosity, and you can talk with her to help her understand what the reality of ps. But I wouldn&#39;t let her go. Remember you are the parent and not all choices should be made by her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99944316,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;ikonstitcher@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Asking to go to school","postDate":"1022601606","msgId":7328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5MThGNzk2LjI2NjY3JWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEYzMktxVU5SMjY4YnhGSU9tdkgwMDAwZmZiYUBob3RtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":7327,"nextInTopic":7330,"prevInTime":7327,"nextInTime":7329,"topicId":7327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
