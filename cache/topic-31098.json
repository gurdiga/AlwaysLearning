Inspired by her, two Australian sisters living <br/>\nin Los Angeles decided about two years ago to expand the model into a symbol of <br/>\ntheir homeland, the endangered Great Barrier Reef. Galvanized by the sisters, <br/>\n120 Chicago area residents began three months ago to crochet their own <br/>\nreef.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nchicagotribune.com/reef  has the full article and a few not very satisfying <br/>\npictures.
