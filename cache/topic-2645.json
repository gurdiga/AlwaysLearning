Perhaps it&#39;s also a consequence<br/>\nof Western culture and religion where we are conditioned to believe there is<br/>\none right answer to each question. We aren&#39;t comfortable with shades of gray<br/>\nand fuzziness. (Seems to me the Japanese were a lot more comfortable<br/>\nembracing and exploring chaos theory when it was first described.)<br/>\n<br/>\nScience isn&#39;t about declaring something a truth. (Though I think what makes<br/>\nscientists jump out of bed in the morning is the quest for ultimate truth!)<br/>\nIt&#39;s about identifying things that posess certain qualities. It&#39;s about<br/>\ninvestigating things that behave in ways that can be predicted. (Atoms<br/>\nbehave in predictable ways. Light behaves in predictable ways. Anything that<br/>\nwe can say &quot;When we do this, then this (almost always!) happens.) And then<br/>\nseeking to explain (theorize) why they behave that way. And then testing<br/>\nthose theories. And using those as building block to create more generalized<br/>\ntheories.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf something can&#39;t be controlled or repeated then it isn&#39;t something that<br/>\ncan be scientifically investigated. To choose something more tangible than<br/>\nthe existence of souls or the sixth sense: we probably don&#39;t know nearly as<br/>\nmuch about love as we do about the workings of quarks even though love is<br/>\npretty much universally accepted as existing and lots have people haven&#39;t<br/>\neven heard of quarks. ;-) We can&#39;t reproduce love or scientifically control<br/>\nit -- though undoubtedly some scientists have tried! -- so science can&#39;t<br/>\nreally say that much scientific about why we fall in love with who we do<br/>\nother than it&#39;s chemistry!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we cannot prove OR disprove the<br/>\n&gt; reliability of things such as astrology, gods, the<br/>\n&gt; size of the universe, how it began, etc.  Which means,<br/>\n&gt; simply, that we do not know.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a big difference between we don&#39;t know because we don&#39;t yet know<br/>\nenough and we don&#39;t know because we can&#39;t investigate it. Scientists can<br/>\ninvestigate the size of the universe, the weight of the atom, the chemistry<br/>\nof the sun. A scientific theory must fit into the larger jigsaw puzzle of<br/>\nwhat we understand. It can&#39;t just fit the part the scientist is<br/>\ninvestigating (the size of the universe for example) and not fit in with<br/>\nother theories and other data. For example, the explanation for the size of<br/>\nthe universe or existence of black holes can&#39;t violate the speed of light or<br/>\nthe weight of an electron or other things that are well known. If it does,<br/>\nthen the theory needs to expand to explain how those theories are<br/>\ninadequate.<br/>\n<br/>\nScientists can&#39;t investigate the sixth sense or gods or souls because they<br/>\ncan&#39;t be tested in the lab. That doesn&#39;t immediately make them untrue. But<br/>\nit puts them in the category of belief rather than science. It doesn&#39;t make<br/>\nthe ideas inferior (except as parts of explainable, reproducible reality!).<br/>\nIt just makes them a different species of ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That works for me and Science cannot prove<br/>\n&gt; it is anything more than a modern superstition...
