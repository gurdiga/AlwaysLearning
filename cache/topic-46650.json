Her resentment toward Jude rears its ugly head on ocassion.  She is starting to show signs of resentment toward Rueben now, too.  I was hoping to get some advice.  For example, Mia and I used to spend a lot of time in her room, just the two of us, prior to Rueben&#39;s birth.  Even when Jude was a toddler, he was more independent, and didn&#39;t need to be so close always.  Rueben, on the other hand, is quite attached, and these times alone with Mia simply do not happen.  Well -- rarely, anyway.  Mia constantly wishes her brothers &#39;didn&#39;t exist&#39; so it can be just &#39;me, you and Daddy&#39; again.  Weekends we get time together, with Rueben in tow.  Jude stays with partner/Dad (Paul).  This is the best I can do.  And it was EASY when he was a baby . . . but now, our time together always seem rushed.  Always determined by Rueben, and *his* needs to feed/eat/sleep, etc.  I see many chances for life exploration, but I simply have to keep things moving along (physically) because it&#39;s just not appropriate with a toddler in tow.  She wants to go to a fancy resturant with me and Paul, catch a train into the city (a good hour) and climb the Eureka Building (tallest in Melb. with a viewing platform), go to an opera/ballet, etc -- these things are just not possible with Rueben in tow.  I can see why she resents him!  I understand that this is the reality we live in, but *I* also would LOVE to be able to spend one-on-one with her, taking part in these really exciting activities together.  We really want this, and I honestly don&#39;t know how I can give it to her now.  I appreciate that in maybe 6 months or so Rueben will losen his attachment, but not something that can be predicted.  Mia wants to know &#39;when&#39; from me.  All I can say is &#39;when Rueben is a little older&#39;.  It&#39;s just not good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can&#39;t seem to think outside the square with this one!  Any experiences, advice, etc?
