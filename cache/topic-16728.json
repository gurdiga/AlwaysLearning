He took art lessons, drew every day, and delighted us with his increasing skill. He had a great love for Disney-style art and spent a lot of time drawing Disney characters. He got astonishingly good. At twelve he was earning money doing &quot;quick sketch&quot; portraits at parties. He learned how to do this from a retired artist who had worked at Disneyland...<br/>\n<br/>\n[Later, when Ely started researching schools,] He found out that they were all horrendously expensive. Finally, he discovered a life drawing class in L.A. that was taught by a retired Disney animator. He signed up and made the two-and-a-half hour trip once a week. He met some people in the class who told him about an ROP animation class held at a high school in the area. He signed up for that, too, and said he felt like he was in the right place...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ROP program funnels talented people into the animation industry by creating internships with the various animation studios. Ely just recently interview to become an intern at Film Roman, an animation company in L.A., and he got the internship. He will train there for about a month, and if they like him, he&#39;ll be put on the payroll...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beauty of all this is that while Ely&#39;s artistic peers are grinding away in universities or at expensive art schools, with no guarantee of work in that field, Ely will be busy training in the nitty-gritty of his chosen career.<br/>\n<br/>\nSteve and I have always told the boys that we&#39;ve both had a wonderful life, each of us doing what we love to do (and getting paid for it), without having attended college. Instead, we move directly toward our goals with as few middlemen as possible. It was definitely a quicker and more enjoyable way to go, and it always seemed much cheaper. We are clear now that many kinds of work can be entered directly through some kind of apprenticeship arrangement, or through a trade school, or by simply working on your own, getting tips from mentors or books when you get stuck. We are more sure than ever that college is not for everyone, that for many kinds of work it is not the best route, that it is shamefully overpriced for what you get, that it doesn&#39;t guarantee you a good-paying job (or any job, for that matter), and that its hard sell given routinely in high school is not deserved.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9309534,"authorName":"Norma","from":"&quot;Norma&quot; &lt;athomeopathy@...&gt;","profile":"tessimal","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: do unschoolers get good jobs?","postDate":"1066482160","msgId":16753,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJtcmRsZytza3IyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGJtcWJjYStyZWVhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16749,"nextInTopic":16759,"prevInTime":16752,"nextInTime":16754,"topicId":16728,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... school. ...

At 16 she has had her life path <br/>\npretty well set for the past 6-10 years, believe it or not.   She is <br/>\na figure skater, first and foremost, training almost every day.  She <br/>\naims to be a coach and ice choreographer.  She does compete but we <br/>\nhave never gotten into the fierce competition that would put her in <br/>\nOlympic contention.  Costs way too much for our meager means, along <br/>\nthe lines of $34,000-$50,000 a year!!!!  With no help from the <br/>\nexceedingly rich USFSA that has billions in its coffers.  We can&#39;t <br/>\neven do it on a shoestring, but instead have managed 10 years of <br/>\ntraining and coaching on fierce frugality and plenty of &quot;old baling <br/>\ntwine,&quot; as I always say.  But she definitely has what it takes to be <br/>\na great coach and choreographer, is known for her beauty and grace, <br/>\nher unique musical selections, and unusual choreography on the ice.  <br/>\nAt this point all the other young skaters are trying to copy her <br/>\nmoves, the surest sign of respect and admiration in skating.  That&#39;s <br/>\ncareer loop #1.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCareer loop #2 is to get her undergrad degree in fine arts, with an <br/>\nemphasis on ceramics.  She is specifically interested in raku and pit-<br/>\nfiring.  She applied for and attended a summer college program for <br/>\nsenior high students this past summer, attending a course in raku and <br/>\npit-firing.  She received a full scholarship and absolutely loved <br/>\nEarlham College.  Having visited and attended other programs at other <br/>\ncolleges over the past 3 years this was the first time she said that <br/>\nthis was the school where she wanted to get her degree.  We will see <br/>\nwhat kind of scholarship and financing package they offer her.  Since <br/>\nraku ceramics is not offered at very many colleges she will not have <br/>\na lot of choice, so I am very happy that she has already found one <br/>\nschool that offers this curriculum and that she loves.  She even <br/>\nliked the dorms, where she stayed during the hottest month of the <br/>\nyear without air conditioning, hanging out in the exceedingly hot <br/>\nkiln room, covered in slip.  And she loved the dorm food!  Wow!  That <br/>\nwas a big surprise, since she is usually the pickiest eater around.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also loves clothing design and has been doing that since she was <br/>\n8 years old, winning the state trophy in 4-H when she was 10 for one <br/>\nof her outfits.  She may or may not drift into that as a career <br/>\ndirection at some point.  But meanwhile she gets lots of satisfaction <br/>\nout of designing and making her own unique clothes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has a school lined up for graduate school and we will go <br/>\nvisit there sometime this year.  She will apply to this school, <br/>\nAlfred University in Afred, NY, for undergrad school, too, but <br/>\nEarlham is clearly her first choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back in teendom, she worked for two years in the gift shop <br/>\nat our local Museum Center where she had worked as a youth volunteer, <br/>\na great job reference for the future with a letter of recommendation <br/>\nfrom the CEO.  And she has worked seasonally as a skate guard at her <br/>\nhome ice rink during their busy holiday season every year.  Currently <br/>\nshe is working at our local branch library.  These are all premium <br/>\njobs, hard to get, with very few openings, competitive, requiring <br/>\nspecial skills, and that pay well for teens.  The library job is <br/>\nespecially good, guaranteeing her 12 hours a week at well above <br/>\nMcDonald&#39;s wages, all the while learning and being around great <br/>\npeople, great books, great educational resources.  She always comes <br/>\nhome with an armload of books, CDs, software, sheet music, etc.  I <br/>\nwould highly recommend that other unschoolers look into library <br/>\njobs.  Might also help her qualify for a library job at college.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, there are great jobs and wonderful opportunities out there <br/>\nfor &quot;unschoolers.&quot;  Many, like my daughter, will be best suited for <br/>\nmore unconventional careers.  Even the college she chose is listed in <br/>\nThe Fiske Guide To Getting Into The Right College as one of the <br/>\ntop &quot;nonconformist&quot; colleges, which seems quite appropriate.  And her <br/>\nsecond-choice college is listed as one of the &quot;best-kept secrets&quot; <br/>\ncolleges, greatly respected in the world of ceramics.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo don&#39;t think that unschoolers can&#39;t find their niche.  On the <br/>\ncontrary, I think they are the best candidates for truly finding <br/>\ntheir own way in the world.  After all, they have been doing it all <br/>\nalong.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":113028911,"authorName":"Dnowens@aol.com","from":"Dnowens@...","profile":"echomygecko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] do unschoolers get good jobs?","postDate":"1066465477","msgId":16738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE0Zi4yNTNkZWQ0OS4yY2MyNTJjNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":16731,"nextInTopic":16749,"prevInTime":16737,"nextInTime":16739,"topicId":16728,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 10/17/03 10:18:59 PM Central Daylight Time, Trisha@RadicalMom.net writes: Does anyone have any info or links about unschoolers who went to ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-311218059\">In a message dated 10/17/03 10:18:59 PM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Trisha@...\">Trisha@...</a> writes:<br/>\nDoes anyone have any info or links about unschoolers who went to <br/>\ncollege or got a really good job?

She&#39;s living in Santa Fe, studying karate intently, and working <br/>\nconstruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuin is joining the National Guard soon.  She worked at McDonald&#39;s in <br/>\nMoriarty until she could afford to move into Albuquerque and get an apartment.  She&#39;s <br/>\nworking at Walmart AND at Red Lobster.  Not a great job?  She&#39;s just turned <br/>\nseventeen.   She&#39;ll get some college tuition assistance from the national guard <br/>\ndeal.   It&#39;s pretty impressive for a seventeen year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris has worked at REI since he was seventeen or so.  He&#39;s 22 now, so has <br/>\nhad the same good job for five years.
