Because of the fun she had in 3rd <br/>\ngrade, she started school the next school year, which was last August, <br/>\nas a 4th grader.  After a month of school, she decided 4th wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to be as great as 3rd and returned to homeschooling.  She stayed <br/>\nin a quiet state of being from August until late February when she <br/>\nseemed to return to her very active, fun seeking, social personality.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe plays with brother who is 11 years old, but he prefers spending a <br/>\ngreat deal of time alone in his room.  He isn&#39;t as active as she wants <br/>\nto be.  She&#39;s feeling lonely, bored and restless.  She&#39;s talked about <br/>\ngoing back to school because at least she has something to do there <br/>\nand is around a lot of kids.  But I&#39;ve noticed that the time she <br/>\nreally seems most lonely and bored is in the evenings and late at <br/>\nnight.  She sleeps until about 1:00pm most days.  By dinner time, <br/>\nshe&#39;s the most energetic and ready for something, though she can&#39;t <br/>\nseem to explain what she feels like doing except to say she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be in our house or our yard.  She&#39;ll tell me she wants to go <br/>\nsomewhere and do something.  I spend a great deal time of with her <br/>\ndoing what she wants but she says it&#39;s not enough.  Although she loves <br/>\nbeing with me, I&#39;m not a girl her own age, her own words.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t really want to return to school, mostly because of the <br/>\nhours.  She prefers going to bed past midnight and sleeping until <br/>\nafternoon.  She truly hates waking up at 7:00am.  Her ideal situation <br/>\nwould be to have a place to go from 6:00pm to midnight to just play <br/>\nwith other children.  She said that if there was a school open at <br/>\nthose hours, she would want to be there.  We live in a one-street <br/>\nneightborhood with few kids.  She has tried to be friends with them <br/>\nbut they are never out when she wants to be out.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I help her with this?  I&#39;ve tried offering her ideas but she&#39;s <br/>\nso bored with all the same old options.  I would love some new ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33891,"nextTopicId":33572}}
