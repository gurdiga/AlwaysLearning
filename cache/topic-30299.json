I have been thinking and thinking about where<br/>\nthat response could come from in me--who would I have to be to have<br/>\nthat response.  I&#39;ve been facing how the current me would be a lot<br/>\nmore likely (at least until I read that post) to have some half-formed<br/>\nthought in my head that the scaring kid should not be acting that way,<br/>\nand then thinking I had to do something to make the scaring kid see<br/>\nthe wrong of it, so he would not do it again. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I started thinking, (and this is just what I imagine I would be<br/>\ndoing if I had said that, not trying to analyze what Sandra may have<br/>\nbeen thinking at that moment) that maybe that easy, fun response was<br/>\nabout making that one moment a good one.  It wasn&#39;t in the future<br/>\nabout keeping the kid from scaring again.  It wasn&#39;t coming from a<br/>\npicture of how the kid ought to be different than he was at that<br/>\nmoment.  It was just about making that one moment more fun and safe<br/>\nfor everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow much easier to just tryto make one moment more fun and safe,<br/>\nrather than trying to manage all these future (imagined) moments by<br/>\ntrying to get the kids to change into (my idea of) fun & safe people.<br/>\n That makes *me* NOT fun, and NOT (emotionally) safe for my kids.  Ha!<br/>\n Turns the whole thing on its head.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also struck by how just a little comment like that, relaying the<br/>\nidea of saying, &quot;you&#39;re brother is behind the door, act scared,&quot; has<br/>\nset off such a chain of thinking and changing in me.  Sometimes it is<br/>\nthe tiniest thing that is able to get through the years of<br/>\nenculturated prejudice against children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to write this to thank Sandra and other poster who share the<br/>\nsmall moments of their lives here.
