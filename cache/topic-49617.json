When I heard that, I ran and filled a big cup with Cheetos and brought them in.  It was a most excellent, fun game as she wondered what was really in the huge cup I had.  When she saw, she was so excited and grateful and happy.  That moment was so fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be so caught up in the badness of Cheetos and trying to keep she and her love apart &lt;g&gt;, but it was soooo much more fun to surprise her with them.

 are they being harsher toward the mentally ill if they have the disease model perspective, or just kinder to those they perceive as suffering  from childhood trauma?  but the authors go on  to say that other studies have supported this outcome, showing that those same people who hold the disease view are the very ones who also believe that the mentally ill are &quot;beyond help&quot;, &quot;pariahs&quot;, &quot;outcasts&quot;... or at least behave that way in their interactions.  the article talks about how cultures that view mental illness as a spiritual affliction, demonic possession, etc., do not exclude afflicted members from their society, they embrace, support and guide.  this is a generalization of course, and can be overly romanticized, but the article is interesting and worth considering, because, as sandra says, there are lots of things purported as &quot;truth&#39; or &quot;fact&quot; that are simply ideas  or theories.  it&#39;s possible that the idea or theory that viewing mental illness as a disease will decrease stigma and improve the lives of people with mental illness is not a valid theory, and that the exact opposite is what is actually occurring.  <br/>\n<br/>\ni want to be clear that i am in no way implying that people aren&#39;t &#39;ill&quot; when they have a mental illness, or that medications don&#39;t have their very important place, just that the disease model is a uniquely american view and perhaps we can learn something from the perspectives of other cultures, rather than simply exporting our views (the article talks about the changing face of mental illness itself, in other countries, as a result of the americanization of their views!)<br/>\n<br/>\nlyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Food and anxiety","postDate":"1263753253","msgId":49669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1NDBFNzVDQTg1QTRGOEY5MEQ5QkJFQTFGMTlDQjA3QGJpZ3N1cnByaXNlPg=="},"prevInTopic":49668,"nextInTopic":49670,"prevInTime":49668,"nextInTime":49670,"topicId":49617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have no significant experience with food allergies or allergies of any kind.

We might suggest <br/>\ngetting a mini-trampoline for the kid to bounce on when watching tv. If <br/>\nyour kid has no arms or legs, maybe a mini-tramp will seem like it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t apply to your kid - but the overall idea is SUPPORT your child <br/>\njust as he or she is and that WILL apply. So, you look at your own real <br/>\nchild and figure out how to do that in a way that works for your child. <br/>\nThere are undoubtedly ways to help a child who has no arms or legs to be <br/>\nable to be more active - my sister has a program for young children with <br/>\nmajor orthopedic disabilities and this is her life - find ways to <br/>\nsupport these kids in doing what they each want to do. It sometimes <br/>\ninvolves equipment, but it always always involves thinking in terms of <br/>\nsupporting that child - not thinking in limited ways about that child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is up to you to figure out how to apply the general principles of <br/>\nunschooling in your life with your child - it doesn&#39;t do anybody ANY <br/>\ngood to say, &quot;Yeah, but...&quot;, to the advice you get. Instead, try to <br/>\nfigure out how it might be applied in your particular case.<br/>\n<br/>\nGet the sense of what unschooling is like - what it means- why it makes <br/>\nsense. Don&#39;t argue with particulars. As it sinks in to you, you will <br/>\nintroduce it gradually into your family&#39;s life just because it will make <br/>\nsense. It isn&#39;t likely that you can go from control and restriction to <br/>\ncomplete freedom and expect good results very quickly if you&#39;ve done all <br/>\nkinds of switching from one approach to another, over time, this will be <br/>\njust another thing mom is desperately trying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ARE introducing it as just one more desperate attempt to find <br/>\nsomething that &quot;works,&quot; then it won&#39;t work. Unschooling isn&#39;t a method, <br/>\nit isn&#39;t a new technique to use on your child to get the outcome you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust think about one choice at a time - don&#39;t make big broad sweeping <br/>\nhuge changes in your family&#39;s lifestyle all at once. Just think of some <br/>\nway you can be more supportive, more respectful to the child&#39;s <br/>\ninterests. When you make the next choice, think of a way you can be a <br/>\nbit more of a facilitator and less of a dictator.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt really doesn&#39;t matter what diagnoses your child has - these <br/>\nprinciples are exactly the same. And every single one of us has to <br/>\nfigure out how they work in our own family with our own real children. <br/>\nMY child may not have the same kinds of issues yours has, but, trust me, <br/>\nmy child is different, too. Your issues are harder, I&#39;m not trying to <br/>\ndownplay them, but the unschooling approach TO them is still exactly the <br/>\nsame.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion to you is that sometimes parents with autistic kids are <br/>\nvery concrete and specific, themselves, and they look at the specific <br/>\nexamples, but aren&#39;t catching on to the bigger picture - the overall <br/>\nsense of how unschooling works. You might be hearing very clearly that <br/>\nwe don&#39;t limit or restrict food, but it might be that you&#39;re hearing <br/>\nthat outside of the bigger context of how the family lives. It is the <br/>\nBIGGER context that matters most.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people often need to think more about how to set the stage for <br/>\nbeing able to live without food restrictions in a happy way, and less <br/>\nabout the specific restrictions. Maybe they&#39;ll naturally drop the <br/>\nrestrictions when they no longer make sense to them, when they seem <br/>\nwrong to inflict in the context of an overall unschooling life.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Food and anxiety","postDate":"1263748205","msgId":49667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEYzMzE5MTk1ODE2MjQxNkFBOTY1MEE0ODBEMDNGMzRGQEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2QjI0Q0RGLTQ2OTYtNDA5RC04QzNBLUUyMEVCREE2NUFBMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhpdjYxdis0cWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDZCMjRDREYtNDY5Ni00MDlELThDM0EtRTIwRUJEQTY1QUExQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49666,"nextInTopic":49668,"prevInTime":49666,"nextInTime":49668,"topicId":49617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Where extremely picky eating becomes a concern to me for our son (age 15) is how it effects his whole life. He started out eating basically anything, then","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1640946015\">Where extremely picky eating becomes a concern to me for our son (age 15) is how it effects his whole life. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe started out eating basically anything, then around the age of 6 (same time he began to struggle in school) he began to eliminate foods he had once loved.  By age 8 he ate only about 5 foods.  He ate nothing but tacos for several years - flour tortilla, ground beef with Taco Bell seasoning and shredded lettuce.  He will not eat anything that travels well - so taking a cooler with food is not going to work - most food has to be warm/hot for him.  He does tend to rotate his favorite item more regularly - he used to eat the same two meals for at least a year and then switch - now he changes about every two to four weeks.  The changing is pure angst for him he will go several days without eating and then make the change to a new (same as something in the past). Up until about a year ago he would stand in the kitchen and literally cry, saying I&#39;m starving but nothing sounds good.  If we fixed him something anyway - something he had been eating - he&#39;d refuse to eat it saying - I&#39;m tired of that - It doesn&#39;t taste good anymore.  Now at age 15 it is more like whining but he still goes through these stages about every 2-4 weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has not eaten a fruit nor a vegetable in years - OK I take that back he does eat lettuce on his tacos at Taco Bell.  And he has just started eating at Taco Bell again after several years of not eating there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere it is limiting is there are so many social activities involving food:  parties, sleep overs, day camps, visits to relatives, family dinners, etc.  he chooses not to attend many social things that would last more than a few hours because, &quot;What would I eat?&quot;   Gentle reminders that he might want to eat before he goes somewhere helps some but not much.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFoods he likes at a restaurant, he does not like at home and it has to be only at a particular restaurant - though he will eat plain bacon cheese burgers at many restaurants as long as it is not a fast food restaurant.  He will not eat a burger fixed at home though.  He loves Teriyaki beef form one particular restaurant, but not from home and no other restaurant.  Food has to be fixed a certain way - for example cheese on a bacon cheese burger and cheese on his nachos - but he will not eat cheese on any other food nor just eat cheese.  He will eat lettuce on his tacos from Taco Bell but never lettuce any other way.  He loves to eat plain Lays potato chips with his roast beef sandwich from Subway but he will never eat just the chips by themselves nor with anything else.  And the specifics go on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe too went through a hand washing stage when he was around 9 - when his hands got chapped and bleeding he managed to stop the washing.  He will never use any type of lotion nor lip balm - so when his lips are cracked and bleeding he just lets it be.  He will not use soap on his face either. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my internet searches I do know that there are adults out there that eat less than he does - for example nothing but French fries and cheese bread.  Some have health issues and some do not.  Most do say that it has really impacted their lives and they wish they were not this way - that social situations are very difficult and work situations can be extremely difficult.  Many find privacy to eat (like eating in their vehicle) so people don&#39;t question them and make statements about their eating.  Relationships can be difficult as most people do not understand that picky eating is not a choice.  For some people it is all about the texture, for some it has to be bland food, etc.  Some people have been picky from birth and others became picky later in childhood.  Many of the picky people that are parents have some children that are picky and some that are not, or none of their children are picky.<br/>\nMost of them have been to therapist, hypnotherapists, etc - some say it helped a tiny bit and others say it didn&#39;t help at all.<br/>\nI guess what I&#39;m trying to say is there is no one shoe fits all for the why or how of picky eating.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcceptance comes in realizing that we give the freedom to choose what he eats knowing he may or may not change.  We do not give him the freedom to choose his food - expecting him to change - thinking &quot;Oh, if I give him any food he wants then he will eventually expand his choices.&quot;  won&#39;t work because he may or may not.  The acceptance comes from allowing him to choose anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Food and anxiety","postDate":"1263741155","msgId":49666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2QjI0Q0RGLTQ2OTYtNDA5RC04QzNBLUUyMEVCREE2NUFBMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhpdjYxdis0cWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhpdjYxdis0cWpsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49665,"nextInTopic":49667,"prevInTime":49665,"nextInTime":49667,"topicId":49617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I recently read in an article about autism and food issues that eating disorders are common in all children , which made me laugh because I thought, in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-348671252\">-=-I recently read in an article about autism and food issues that  <br/>\n&quot;eating disorders are common in all children&quot;, which made me laugh  <br/>\nbecause I thought, in that case we should stop calling them disorders  <br/>\nand see them as part of growing up.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps that&#39;s true.<br/>\nProbably that&#39;s one of the very worst things about calling anything &quot;a  <br/>\ndisorder&quot; or  &quot;special needs.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- The article also made the point, however, that &quot;children with  <br/>\nspecial needs require special intervention.&quot; The tricky part as a  <br/>\nparent is figuring out when a child REALLY needs special intervention,  <br/>\nand when a child can decide what to eat and how.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are tens of thousands of articles written every day.

That wouldn&#39;t be living with unschooling principles.  On the other hand, a parent and child could be working together to uncover the difficulties, and an elimination diet could be a tool to use in that process.  But the key, imho, is that the parent has trust that a child will ultimately be able to do what is best, so if the child isn&#39;t feeling good and doesn&#39;t know why, and the parent is trusted and suggests an elimination diet, it is with the understanding that the child has choice about whether to try it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is trying a gluten free diet right now.  I won&#39;t go into the particulars, but it&#39;s his choice, and remains his choice about whether to continue.

If we are not talking life and death, there is no reason that a child can&#39;t have the freedome to make their own choices around food and do their own experimentation.  If they are allowed to do that from early on, they may be able to avoid the offenders, if they have more complexities, they will invariably choose to feel better.

An elimination diet is usually the best diagnostic tool.  One can get all kinds of false positives and negatives with allergy testing.  And no, the allergic person often can&#39;t figure out which food is causing the problem.  That&#39;s the point of the elimination diet.  It&#39;s not a means of torture.  It&#39;s a way of answering a question that can&#39;t be answered in any other way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it sometimes happens that the person wants to eat more and more of the allergic food.  It can give a kind of &quot;high&quot; and seem addictive.  So if a child wants to eat only one food and not any others, this may be the exact wrong thing for their body.  This is true of adults too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has nothing to do with &quot;relaxing&quot; about food.  It possibly about treating a medical condition, which isn&#39;t always pleasant.  However, we&#39;re not with the child in question, so I don&#39;t think we should be giving hard and fast rules about this.  The poster was looking for ideas and suggestions.  I gave a few.  She can take them or leave them as they seem to be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s nice that your child figured out her own food intolerances, but I was the one who figured out what foods made *my* kids sick.  Should I have kept my mouth shut?  They are living much happier lives now and are extremely grateful to me for seeing the connection.  We all need an outside opinion now and then.  There&#39;s no reason we shouldn&#39;t give these to our own children if it seems appropriate.  It has hardly stunted my child&#39;s growth that I&#39;ve figured out how to stop her daily, incapacitating migraines.

He has a number of fears and rituals and compulsions to do with food, as well as being extremely limited with food choices.***<br/>\n<br/>\nDylan didn&#39;t have anxiety that I remember but he had strong preferences and rituals.  He was and still is a frequent hand washer, not compulsive, but if someone was looking to label him they might easily notice his hand washing.   While he did not wash his hands during a meal if his hand touched his plate he did wash them if they touched food, or if his drinking glass had condensation and his hand got wet.   He doesn&#39;t wash his hands during a meal now unless he gets an unexpected cat on his lap or something like that.&lt;g&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\nDylan was eventually diagnosed with psoriasis.  Not anxiety, not autism, not ocd.  He has a chronic skin disease and his skin, especially on his hands has always felt weird and he learned to soothe them with cold water. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we can&#39;t always know why a certain thing makes a kid feel better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll people have food preferences and rituals. You don&#39;t notice your own anymore because you&#39;ve been doing them forever but the first time you eat with a new acquaintance theirs are obvious!&lt;g&gt;  Some people smell their food before eating.  Some people turn their plate so the food they&#39;re eating is right in front of them.  Some people scoot their food around on the plate.  Some people have to have just the right amount of food on the fork.  Someone eating with you for the first time would notice your quirks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not like my food to touch on the plate.  I eat one thing gone and then eat the next.  David (dh)  *likes* his food all scooshed together and is happily surprised when he gets combination flavors in one bite.  Dylan prefers, except for salad, foods without sauces.  He likes nuts and he likes bread be he doesn&#39;t want to find nuts in his bread.&lt;g&gt;  He doesn&#39;t like food &quot;surprises&quot; no unexpected ooze or crunch in a food he thought was solid or soft. <br/>\n<br/>\nFood preferences, food rituals are normal.  A limited palate is *very* normal for children.  A kid who eats any and everything is the exception. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Some say that these extremes are because of his severe food allergies as a baby***<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say probably yeah, if you had anxiety about his foods and were super careful then you showed him exactly how to be with food.   And if that&#39;s the case, your continued problems with the way he eats and washes and whatever are just adding to his worry.   Let him do what he feels he needs to do.  Stop expressing and showing your own anxieties over his rituals and preferences.  Act like whatever way you eat and he eats is just the right way for each of you.  When you&#39;ve relaxed then he probably will too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***some say it&#39;s because he is on the spectrum.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so what if he is?  Do you think, if he lives with you for eleven more years and sees how you eat, and how his dad eats, (if you&#39;ll both calm down!) and how dinner guests eat and if he watches movies and sees people eat, that he won&#39;t get some different ideas about food and eating himself?  Do you think, if he&#39;s &quot;on the spectrum&quot; that means he is not entitled to his own preferences as a child, that he can&#39;t, like any other child decide what he wants to eat and how?   Just because someone&#39;s ideas about food are different doesn&#39;t mean the person has less right to them.  (you know, unless they&#39;re eating neighborhood children or digging up graves for a snack, or something.) <br/>\n<br/>\n***For me, from an unschooling perspective, it is hard to trust his food choices when they are so tangled up with anxiety.

We have had conversations with him about the rituals and limits, health, nutrition, feelings etc but he is powerless to overcome these things. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think he&#39;s powerless.  I think your worry keeps feeding his.  Let it be, be cool about it.  Stop talking about food.  I don&#39;t think you can say anything now that won&#39;t worry him.  You wrote that you have not tried to control his food intake but if you&#39;re talking to him *at all* about food and he&#39;s sensitive about it already (which he is) then *any* comment you make is going to cause him concern. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I happened to mention one day that I had just realised that the top two ingredients of Ocean Sparay juice were water and HFCS, and that it might be an idea to try some other brand with sugar instead of HFCS, because lots of people felt that HFCS was not good for the body long term. &lt;snip&gt;   He looks and sounds tortured. *** <br/>\n<br/>\nWell he *IS* tortured.  If he had allergies as a baby and your example has been that food might be dangerous then you&#39;ve just told him one more thing is dangerous.   Let him eat what he wants and how he wants and get over the idea he has to be just like everybody else.  He&#39;s seven!  He has years to get more comfortable with life and germs and food but he can&#39;t if you keep filling him up with worry and fear. <br/>\n<br/>\n***I haven&#39;t done it, and wouldn&#39;t do, it but I feel sometimes I just want to break him out of it by only serving him food with a piece of fruit on the table, or not letting him have more than one hand wash per meal etc. He wouldn&#39;t starve or would he?***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf some of his anxiety has been caused by your worry over allergens and your worry that he&#39;s not eating enough and your worry that he eats weird then the more unpleasantness you bring to the food table is only going to add to his anxiety.  If your husband hated avocados would you serve them to him to snap him out of it?   I don&#39;t know if he would starve but no child can thrive if he&#39;s hounded and disrespected by his parents. <br/>\n<br/>\n***How can I support him/us through this?***<br/>\n<br/>\nLet him wash his hands. Let him have two or three plates or whatever.  Let him choose his own food.    Don&#39;t say anything negative about calories, or nutrition content or ingredients you&#39;re suspicious of, stop making food something to worry over and over time his own worry will subside.   Eat what you like, try new things yourself, but let him be. <br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years Dylan&#39;s food choices expanded.  Quite suddenly when he was sixteen he started eating lots of foods he never wanted to try before.  He still does not like carrots or strong tomato flavor.   A boy who is seven with strong food preference will someday be a boy of sixteen.  Maybe he&#39;ll still have strong food preferences!  I only know a few adults who will eat anything... everyone has preferences.  But in those years you can relax and help him eat how he wants or you can keep adding anxiety to his food.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128237955,"authorName":"Beth Danicke","from":"&quot;Beth Danicke&quot; &lt;saremca@...&gt;","profile":"saremca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Food and anxiety","postDate":"1263517497","msgId":49636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENCMDk5N0YwRDlCNjRDRjk5NDI0MzE2MEM4RjE0RjJCQEZBTUlMWVJPT00+","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCNEY2NkJGLjUwOTA2MDBAbWFjLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhpbXYyYysycTY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MzVENjMwRDItRkFBQy00QzRCLUI0QUQtQjNGRUI0MzBEQTFEQGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8NEI0RjY2QkYuNTA5MDYwMEBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49625,"nextInTopic":49645,"prevInTime":49635,"nextInTime":49637,"topicId":49617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"= =My sister was awesome in not making any kind of big deal about her daughter s very very limited eating habits.

She did several OCD-type behaviors including washing  <br/>\nher hands excessively and obsessing about what she would or would not/  <br/>\nhad or had not eaten.  She lost a considerable amount of weight over a  <br/>\nperiod of several months and her hands became very raw and sore -- we  <br/>\nwere very concerned about her. I did a lot of research reading books,  <br/>\nasking questions of other unschooling families with children who  <br/>\nsuffered OCD and consulting with therapists.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver time, I discovered that the single most important way to help Zoe  <br/>\nwas to become totally and unequivocally trustworthy to her.  She was  <br/>\nquite guarded about her thought processes behind her behaviors. It was  <br/>\nonly after she was able to relax, knowing that whatever her anxiety  <br/>\nwas I would accommodate her immediately and without question, that she  <br/>\nwas able to start to open up and share her fears and the thinking  <br/>\nbehind them.  For instance, she was very fearful to go anywhere away  <br/>\nfrom home and would often, suddenly, demand that we leave some place  <br/>\nor event.  If I didn&#39;t accommodate her right then and there she would  <br/>\ntry to leave on her own - start walking in the direction that she  <br/>\nthought was home or go to the car and stay by it if it was locked. We  <br/>\nstarted taking two vehicles on local family outings and we devised  <br/>\nplans for how we would leave if she needed to depart the area  <br/>\nsuddenly.  Over a long period of many months she began to trust that  <br/>\nwe would get her out of whatever situation it was that was causing her  <br/>\nanxiety without asking any questions of her, and only then was she  <br/>\nwilling to go places and participate in social activities. Trust was  <br/>\nkey to her ability to relax and communicate with us about what was  <br/>\nhappening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that this approach will work for everyone with children  <br/>\nwho worry or are anxious, but it has made such a huge difference in  <br/>\nour lives - now, just 3-1/2 years later, Zoe is eager to go places,  <br/>\nmeet new people and try new experiences. I&#39;m aware of the few triggers  <br/>\nfor her anxieties - I need to have hand sanitzer or sanitizing wipes  <br/>\nhandy when we travel and we are aware that she is particular about  <br/>\neating out at certain types of restaurants and pot-luck situations.   <br/>\nShe doesn&#39;t like anybody to notice or be aware of her anxieties but I  <br/>\ntry to be sensitive to her sensibilities and have an action plan to  <br/>\nget her to a safe-feeling place if something unexpected should occur.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast week, while we were at Sandra&#39;s Symposium in Santa Fe, Zoe  <br/>\nastounded me with her eager willingness to go to the Children&#39;s Museum  <br/>\nwith a family she barely knew, and hang out multiple evenings in other  <br/>\npeople&#39;s condominiums with crowds of young people playing games -- all  <br/>\nwithout me or her father around.

The OP on that thread (Unschooling principles and special circumstances) mentioned Aspergers, and I know that one of the things which can help contribute to a dx on the autistic spectrum (Aspergers particularly) is a difficult relationship with food.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own DS (7) is very anxious around food and drink. He has a number of fears and rituals and compulsions to do with food, as well as being extremely limited with food choices. He has to hand wash before eating and also several times during eating (for ex if his hand accidentally touches his plate). He will not eat food that has been near fruit or that he believes has been breathed on by anyone. He will only eat one food at a time, so tinned tuna and a slice of bread is eaten as a two course meal on separate plates. He will not eat in anyone else&#39;s house (except Granny&#39;s). And so on. He has meltdowns when we breach one of his rules around food.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome say that these extremes are because of his severe food allergies as a baby, some say it&#39;s because he is on the spectrum. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, from an unschooling perspective, it is hard to trust his food choices when they are so tangled up with anxiety. I know his diet is nutritionally poor. He is thin and as a baby was dx &quot;failing to thrive&quot;.  For the last two years we have not tried to control his food intake. We have had conversations with him about the rituals and limits, health, nutrition, feelings etc but he is powerless to overcome these things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I write DH is talking to DS about drinks. Until about a month ago DS drank either water or Ocean Spray Cranberry and Raspberry juice. I happened to mention one day that I had just realised that the top two ingredients of Ocean Sparay juice were water and HFCS, and that it might be an idea to try some other brand with sugar instead of HFCS, because lots of people felt that HFCS was not good for the body long term. I didn&#39;t ban it or even ask him to stop drinking it. He reacted very strongly and immediately stopped drinking it. His struggle to try a different brand is painful to witness. He only drinks water but desperately wants juice. He will not drink Ocean Spray but as I write he is sitting on the kitchen floor weeping in front of a long line of other juices and drinks I have bought over the last month to try and tempt him. He looks and sounds tortured. DH is comforting and talking gently to him about his feelings and options.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard it said somewhere that people can make the excuse that unschooling doesn&#39;t work for children with special needs but that they are mistaken.
