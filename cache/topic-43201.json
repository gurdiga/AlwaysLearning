He hung out with local","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1371954092\">I&#39;ve got varied perspectives on this one, all wrapped up in me!<br/>\nWhen I met Mitch, DDH (Dead Darling Husband), I dubbed him a Thug. He hung<br/>\nout with local dealers, though he didn&#39;t seem an addict.<br/>\nOnce we began dating, he kept me (& us) far from that lifestyle and I<br/>\nrealized he saw me as a chance to start over. Even moving the two of us to<br/>\nSouth Dakota to have a clean chance at a new life, away from the temptations<br/>\nof his former lifestyle.<br/>\nEven after dating, living together, moving, marriage and children, I knew<br/>\nvery, very few details of this Thug existence he lived. Only that he<br/>\ncollected money for his friends who were dealers. That&#39;s it. I knew that if<br/>\nI pressed, I could get answers, and I knew those answers would change how I<br/>\nlooked at this Man before me. I chose not to ask. I chose, instead to live<br/>\nin the Now and let him live there, too, without regret or fear.<br/>\nAfter his Los Angeles funeral, I was invited a by the few friends I knew to<br/>\njoin a larger group in celebration of Mitch.  Once there, however, I<br/>\nrealized the stories being told were of that time, that pleasantly unknown<br/>\nto me time, of mischeif and mayhem.  I chose to leave and maintain the<br/>\nmemories of the Mitch I knew, leaving them with their own memories,<br/>\nuntainted by my reaction - and I tossed in the modern version of Mitch for<br/>\n&#39;em too :)<br/>\nThe difference here, I suppose is the fact that I had a choice to know, and<br/>\nchose ignorance.<br/>\nA life partner deserves that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the sneaky streak Sandra described, after a childhood of lying as<br/>\nsurvival, knowing that I&#39;ve kinda swung to the other end of the spectrum.<br/>\nAt 40, I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m finding my happy middle :D<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty much out there, open and trusting.  I have faith that if you love<br/>\nme now, you&#39;ll not mind the path it took for me to get here.  I count on<br/>\nthat among my friends and loved ones.  It&#39;s been THE most painful experience<br/>\nto have some chunk of my past result in present disappointment.  So I<br/>\nunderstand the fear.<br/>\nI think it&#39;s fair to say to one&#39;s partner, &quot;there are things I&#39;ve done that<br/>\nI have a hard time discussing because I fear your opinion of me will<br/>\nchange.&quot;<br/>\nI also think it&#39;s fair to say to YOU: you fear their judgment because you<br/>\nare judging yourself harshly.<br/>\nIf you really see the addiction/recovery as a journey of growth and becoming<br/>\nwho you are right now, and however painful the experience, it has added to<br/>\nyour experience/toolbox/life through positive lessons, then you should share<br/>\nit as just that.  What you went through to learn what you learned and now<br/>\nyou are here. Once you were there, not now.<br/>\nThe responsibility&#39;s on you, at this point, to sit down and dish it out.<br/>\nHere&#39;s how I learned of Mitch&#39;s son he gave up for adoption (which would<br/>\nhave caused me to break up with him immediately if I knew, I had an<br/>\nAbsolutely No Children Anywhere Rule for Dating):<br/>\nI met Kimmy and Jerry. We hung out 3 or 4 times and Mitch says, &quot;I used to<br/>\ndate Kimmy&quot; oh, I thought, she&#39;s nice, she&#39;s got a boyfriend, how cool he&#39;s<br/>\nstill friends with her.<br/>\n3 months later: &quot;We lived together at my mom&#39;s house.&quot; oh, still I liked<br/>\nthem fine. I knew he loved me.<br/>\n3 more months later: &quot;Wanna see pictures of Thomas? He&#39;s the son we had<br/>\ntogether and gave up for adoption&quot; oh god, the kid was so cute, it was too<br/>\nlate. :)<br/>\nNow Hayden knows Thomas is over 18 and might someday find us, to get<br/>\ninformation about their dad.  Kimmy also has another son, with Jerry. Hayden<br/>\nand Jerry Jr share a brother, Thomas, but are not truly related to each<br/>\nother.  Hayden can&#39;t wait to meet either of them :)<br/>\nSo what could be, and would have been for me, a big display of righteous<br/>\njudgment, became instead a really cool web of existence for our family.<br/>\nLike Maslow, I side on the sunny side of humanity. We do the best we can<br/>\nwith what we have. When we know better we do better.<br/>\nDo better.<br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\nhannahsashes.blogspot.com<br/>\ndianas365.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Mon, Mar 16, 2009 at 4:26 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   The subject line was what came with the writing below.
