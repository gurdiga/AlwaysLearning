I haven&#39;t responded, figuring others will have fun with it, but here&#39;s the cool quote: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I guess I wonder if it (deschooling/unschooling) can really be this...enjoyable. I feel like I&#39;m cheating.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told people that if they think they&#39;re not doing enough they should probably do more, but that particular little bit of writing sounded like an amazed mom whose kids were engaged in interesting things.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe some people are in the mood to go over there and talk about that.  It&#39;s a good topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entire post was:  <br/>\nMy family is only a couple of months into deschooling, my dd is 12 and ds is 9. Both were in some sort of school until last fall. As I get better at appreciating my children&#39;s interests I find that I am mot really needed much. There are days when my son needs nothing from me other than snacks and a couple of hugs. Most of the day he is happily occupied and doesn&#39;t really want me getting in the way of his game.<br/>\nI like these easy days but I wonder if there is something I&#39;m missing, something more I should be doing. I do spend time researching activities and events that I think the kids might enjoy and I read a lot about unschooling during my downtime. I just don&#39;t know if I should be doing more. I guess I wonder if it (deschooling/unschooling) can really be this...enjoyable.
