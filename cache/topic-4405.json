My business is<br/>\ngetting to the point where I can nearly sustain the entire family.  The next<br/>\nstep is moving to a bigger house (we won&#39;t qualify for the mortgage once he<br/>\nquits his contract) and then he&#39;s going to quit and work with me in my<br/>\nbusiness.  I&#39;m working on a contract for a syndicated radio show so I&#39;ll<br/>\nneed him to help with tons of things.  That way we&#39;ll both be home with the<br/>\nkids and I&#39;ll work from the studio in my home.  It&#39;s just taken<br/>\nperserverance (sp) and as desire to have the life the way we want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\nPS  Heather and I do a swap with our kids usually once a week.  I have her 2<br/>\nfor a playdate and the next week she has mine.  The kids all get along<br/>\nreally well thank goodness so this has been a wonderful blessing.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Wow!

He turned his hobby into his own<br/>\nbusiness. We saved up so he could quit his job to try and make it work. We<br/>\ndecided we could survive 3 years on our savings if we had to. He quit about<br/>\na year & a half ago and business is growing. People subscribe to hiswebsite<br/>\non a monthly or yearly basis. He works from home, mostly making additions<br/>\nand corrections to the website, maybe 8-12 hours a week. He considers his<br/>\nmove to self-employment part of his de-schooling process.<br/>\n<br/>\nheather<br/>\n<br/>\np.s. he is trained as an electrical engineer and his former job was writing<br/>\nalgorithyms (sp) for TI calculators.<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn  Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4257,"nextTopicId":4406}}
