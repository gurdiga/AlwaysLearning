The adults were all downstairs talking and the kids were all upstairs<br/>\nplaying.  This was an open house and I knew the hostess pretty well but<br/>\nhadn&#39;t seen her for a long time. (About a year and that&#39;s a long time for a<br/>\n7 and 9 yo)   I knew a couple other people there, but my kids didn&#39;t know<br/>\nanyone else but the hostess&#39; kids, whom they aren&#39;t comfortable with<br/>\nanyways.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids stayed with me downstairs.  Several people commented to *me* in<br/>\nfront of my girls as to why they weren&#39;t upstairs with all the other kids.<br/>\nWith each comment the kids drew closer to me.  It feels very uncomfortable<br/>\nto them to be talked about like they weren&#39;t even there.  They aren&#39;t used<br/>\nto being treated so disrespectfully.  It was odd to everyone that my kids<br/>\nwanted to be with me and not with all the other kids, even though they<br/>\ndidn&#39;t know them well.  I tried to ignore it.  I tried to explain.  After<br/>\nseveral more comments, I started to feel uncomfortable about it too.  It was<br/>\nobvious to me that they thought my kids were different because they chose to<br/>\nbe with me and not the other kids.  That didn&#39;t make me want to send my kids<br/>\naway from me or treat them with any less respect, but I certainly felt like<br/>\nI was being criticized in a subtle way.

Dan is an &quot;intellectual&quot;, has a phd in chemistry. I was tucked<br/>\naway in my office when he walked in the front door this afternoon, looked at<br/>\nmy 14 yo who was sitting close to the TV watching a skate video and the man<br/>\nsaid to my son (not knowing I was within earshot), &quot;Unschooling, an<br/>\ninteresting experiment&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was all I could do not to lunge at him, but what I did was breathe deep,<br/>\nwalk out to where he was, and say, &quot;Schooling, an interesting experiment.&quot;<br/>\nHe was certainly surprised, thinking he was just giving his snide remark to<br/>\na kid who was obviously wasting his life away with his parents&#39; permission.<br/>\nWe then engaged in a rather passionate discussion about schooling,<br/>\nunschooling, learning through living, education, how it works, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy this came up for me with your comments Laura was because a huge part of<br/>\nmy discomfort had to do with my reactive caring of what Dan thought. He was<br/>\nthe living breathing person that represented all of those living breathing<br/>\npeople that would judge our life choices, and he was in my house and<br/>\nspeaking negatively to my son! Our passionate discussion was primarily<br/>\nbecause I SO wanted to show him the truth and get him to change his thinking<br/>\n(didn&#39;t happen in the moment, but maybe in a few years?? He has no children<br/>\nof his own). It reminded me of Evangelical Christians who have so<br/>\npassionately wanted me to see their truth. At least by the end, Dan saw that<br/>\nmy son was watching a skate video that he purchased with his own money (as<br/>\nopposed to &quot;spacing out&quot; in front of the TV...not that there&#39;s anything<br/>\nwrong with that :0)), and that he would most likely sometime in the day try<br/>\nsome of the moves on the video. One of Dan&#39;s comments, &quot;It seems that a<br/>\nchild at some point has to realize that they have to leave mommy and daddy&#39;s<br/>\nhome and make it on their own&quot;.

It thought it was wrong to <br/>\nlisten to my instincts...You know, the Bible verse that says to lean <br/>\nnot on your own understanding but to look to God to direct your <br/>\npaths.  I had it hammered into my head for my whole life that <br/>\nsometimes things will seem to be right but if they contradicted with <br/>\nwhat you &quot;knew to be right&quot;, then to not listen to them because our <br/>\nown fleshly desires are just wrong and sinful, and satan will use <br/>\nthem to deceive us.  So I ignored what I wanted and did what I <br/>\nshould, always.  I listened to Christian parenting advocates who told <br/>\nyou that it&#39;s important to teach your kids to listen to arbitrary <br/>\nrules that don&#39;t make sense and to obey you just because, because <br/>\nsomeday they&#39;ll think a command in the Bible doesn&#39;t make sense and <br/>\nthey should be trained to ignore their own deceitful hearts and <br/>\nlisten to God no matter what.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEven once I got over that and became an unschooler, it took me a long <br/>\nwhile to realize that I could just enjoy life and parent my kids <br/>\nnaturally and listen to my own instincts and just love them and enjoy <br/>\nthem.  I did everything the way that I &quot;should&quot;, and for awhile I <br/>\nthought that meant that I should do everything they ever asked me to <br/>\ndo the minute they asked me to do it.  If one child wanted to be up <br/>\nuntil 3 am but didn&#39;t want to stay up without me, I&#39;d stay up with <br/>\nhim AND get up with another child at 7 am when he wanted me up.  And <br/>\nif one child wanted a hot dog at 2 am and we didn&#39;t have hot dogs, <br/>\nI&#39;d run him to 24 hour wal-mart at 2 am.  I literally turned myself <br/>\ninto a human doormat and become my children&#39;s servant instead of <br/>\ntheir mom.  They would fight over what they wanted me to do with <br/>\nthem, and they became demanding of me.  All because I wanted to do <br/>\nit &quot;right&quot;.  I took the &quot;say yes as much as possible&quot; aspect of <br/>\nunschooling to the extreme, because in my mind you technically could <br/>\nignore your own needs SO much that you run yourself ragged never <br/>\nsaying no.  It is humanly possible to not love yourself much at all <br/>\nand to do that. I didn&#39;t realize it at the time that this was still <br/>\none more layer from my former belief of &quot;do things right, not the way <br/>\nyou feel&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil I realized my needs mattered too and that it really was a good <br/>\nthing to love myself as much as I loved my children, THEN our home <br/>\nbecame much more peaceful.  Because until that time the learning was <br/>\nchild-led and fit every definition of unschooling there could be but <br/>\nit still wasn&#39;t as peaceful as it could have been because *I* wasn&#39;t <br/>\nat peace in my own heart. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe philosophy that I carried to the extreme is a philosophy that&#39;s <br/>\nubiquitous in our culture I think.  Most people don&#39;t carry it as far <br/>\nas I did, but it&#39;s something that&#39;s preached not only in churches but <br/>\nin schools and scouts and gov&#39;t and everywhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf everyone believed in the philosophy of enjoy life, enjoy your <br/>\nchildren, love yourself and love your children, do what your heart <br/>\ntells you to do and follow your instincts....well, I think this world <br/>\nwould be a much more peaceful, happy place!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe another thing to add to your checklist, Sandra, would be <br/>\nthat in order for unschooling to work as well as it possibly can, the <br/>\nparent has to focus on emotional wholeness for herself.

I have not known any unschooling parents that have died, or even  <br/>\nhomeschooling parents.  I have known two parents that have died and have  children in <br/>\npublic school.  And public school did not provide that sense of  continuity or <br/>\nconnection or calm.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhat I observed was that the child would bring some of the stress of home  to <br/>\nschool with them.  I would think it would be impossible to NOT do that.  But <br/>\nthe teachers and administrators, even though they were aware of the stresses  <br/>\nat home, would not try to help the child at all.  The child became the  <br/>\n&quot;nuisance child&quot; at school.  Started getting sent to the principal&#39;s  office, <br/>\ngetting detention.  The teachers started calling home saying that  the child just <br/>\nwasn&#39;t paying attention in class, something had to be done  etc.  Which adds to <br/>\nthe stress at home on all concerned.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIn the two instances that I had a chance to observe, school became  another <br/>\nstressor.

And what I was thinking as I decided to get up <br/>\nwas that not everyone can or should unschool.  And I was thinking about <br/>\nstability of situations, and emotions, and families, and life.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s too much thinking for this early in the morning!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some of the thoughts were about the flu epidemic, and tuberculosis, and <br/>\nblack lung, and lack of sanitation and antibiotics in the early 20th century.   <br/>\nWhen parents are dying through no fault of their own, maybe children could <br/>\nuse school as a safety net, a bit of continuity, and connections to the <br/>\ncommunity of their own, outside of their family&#39;s connections.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen masses of people are moving from striated societies to more idealistic <br/>\nsituations with potential or theoretical classlessness and equality, they need <br/>\nthe tools to get in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe school, in 1910, was like the internet is today.  Maybe school, in <br/>\n1920, was what made a child real.  Maybe &quot;being a fourth grader,&quot; in 1930, was <br/>\nbetter than being another starving, neglected, abused orphan.    <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Things have changed.&quot;<br/>\nMedically things have changed, but parents still die.<br/>\nFinancially things have changed, but parents are still unemployed sometimes, <br/>\nor have financial difficulties.<br/>\nSchools have changed.

They&#39;re not a conduit to <br/>\nthe best or only opportunity for learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut any choice needs to involve knowing at least one alternative.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot all parents can provide a rich home environment.  And even all of those <br/>\nwho want to.<br/>\nAnd of those who want to can can, none of them can guarantee living until the <br/>\nchildren are grown.    And there are those scary times for unschoolers, when <br/>\nin a snapshot moment they know their kids are &quot;behind&quot; (and &quot;ahead&quot; moments <br/>\noften come too, I know) and they freak about the idea that if the kids suddenly <br/>\nhad to go to school it might not be smooth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve added another item to my checklist of what will help unschooling, or <br/>\npotentially hamper it.    Peace or calm.    <br/>\n<br/>\nWith some people, peace and calm are natural. <br/>\nFor some, it takes philosophy:  reasons to be calm, self-calming messages.<br/>\nFor some, it takes practice:  therapy, biofeedback, meditation, breathing <br/>\nexercises.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome don&#39;t have peace and calm, or don&#39;t want it, or don&#39;t even believe in it.<br/>\nOr they  might want it and believe in it, but their lives are buried in <br/>\nstresses beyond their control.  Or they might want it and be unable to arrange to <br/>\nhave it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are not well equipped with self awareness enough to feel stress <br/>\nand learn how to overcome it in any physical or mental way.  It picks them up <br/>\nand shakes them, and they live in an overwhelmed state.    Some people enjoy <br/>\nturmoil, and steep in drama.  <br/>\nSome don&#39;t enjoy it but it keeps coming upon them.<br/>\n<br/>\n1:30  a.m. (early Saturday morning) our phone rang  three times.  I was still <br/>\nup talking to Marty, and Kirby was awake.  He got it and I heard his end.  It <br/>\nwas something like &quot;Well just don&#39;t say anything stupid to your parents, and <br/>\nbe calm when the police get there.  And don&#39;t call my house at 1:30 in the <br/>\nmorning anymore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Kirby I&#39;m sure that seemed like reasonable and sensible advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA guy he knows from gaming, who was at his halloween party, who has been over <br/>\na few times to play games and who hangs out at Active Imagination, was in a <br/>\nphysical fight with his stepfather and his mom had called the police.  He <br/>\nwanted Kirby to come rescue him from the situation.  Kirby logically said that he <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t make it there before the police came, and it wouldn&#39;t be cool to take <br/>\nhim away anyway, if the police wouldn&#39;t like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked if he had hurt his mom or stepdad.  No.  <br/>\nWere there other kids?  Two much younger sisters.  (The guy is 15, I think.)<br/>\nHe said the police would probably take the stepdad, if anyone.<br/>\nI said maybe the mom would like for the son to have another safe place to go.<br/>\nHe&#39;s not one of their favorite friends; he&#39;s irritating.  <br/>\nI said I would hope that if things got crazy at our house that if Kirby or <br/>\nMarty were afraid enough to call someone else at 1:30 that they would get some <br/>\nhelp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter some quick discussion and option brainstorming, Kirby called back and <br/>\nasked if he still wanted a rescue.  Yes.   He lives about seven miles away.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty went too.  The police were there, talking to the parents, it was not <br/>\nproblem for the son to go with them.  While they were gone I made beds on two <br/>\ncouches in the library for him and Kirby (whose room is being rearranged for a <br/>\nwindow replacement and he wasn&#39;t going to sleep there anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of my alcoholic mom and my experience with steparents on both sides <br/>\n(when I was 18, but my sister was 14, 15), I sympathized.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the fact that our family and house are NOT that way, no drunken f<br/>\nights in the middle of the night, no adults shaming and controlling kids, no <br/>\nkids needing to tell adults they hate them and want to leave (or whatever all <br/>\nhappened there and happens all around), I also realized I didn&#39;t want to get <br/>\ninvolved.  But this little exposure was probably good for my boys.  I did ask <br/>\nKirby to tell him it was a one-shot deal, and gave him some excuses and reasons <br/>\nto offer if he needed to, that I didn&#39;t want them exposed to craziness because <br/>\nof my own background, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they got a peek at NOT calm.<br/>\nAnd when I woke up thinking &quot;bug bite?&quot; and hot flash and then coughing, I <br/>\ncould have been angry or frustrated, and let the adrenaline come and make <br/>\neverything worse.  I could have woken Keith up and whined and complained.  Years <br/>\nago, I might have done any or all of that.  But because I decided when I was <br/>\npregnant with Kirby that I needed to become a calm and thoughtful mom and really <br/>\nconcentrate on doing that, I no longer need to concentrate to do it.  Now I can <br/>\nbe uncomfortable and a little afraid without turning it into pain and VERY <br/>\nafraid.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I couldn&#39;t do that, I think unschooling would not work as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ve scattered parts all over the table here.  Anyone want to mess with <br/>\nputting any of them together or seeing what&#39;s missing from the set?<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21252,"nextTopicId":21259}}
