I, and to some extent I <br/>\nthink all of us, still struggle with old hang-ups.  I&#39;m pretty new to <br/>\nall of this...unschooling, eating whatever, whenenver, no sleep <br/>\nschedules.  Even though we&#39;ve pretty much been doing these things all <br/>\nalong, now I&#39;m actually saying it out loud and part of me is thinking, <br/>\n&quot;you&#39;re crazy!&quot;  But I&#39;m doing it anyway because I&#39;m a firm believer <br/>\nthat the &quot;crowd&quot; isn&#39;t always right.  Common sense tells me that these <br/>\nchanges are right.  It still doesn&#39;t help that little voice inside that <br/>\nis the Past Me.  All those ingrained childhood things may never go away.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your husband feel things aren&#39;t right?  I&#39;ve discussed with my dh <br/>\nwhat I&#39;m learning from all of you and he thinks it&#39;s a joke.  But I&#39;m <br/>\nthe childbearer and raiser of this house, so what I say goes.  To tell <br/>\nyou the truth, I&#39;m trying to make these changes quietly though because <br/>\nI&#39;d rather he didn&#39;t notice too much too soon.  I hate to fight with <br/>\npeople, even though sometimes I do anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, don&#39;t beat yourself up.  The first step in making a change is <br/>\nseeing the need to change.  I myself have started researching health and <br/>\nexercise at sites like Mayoclinic.com.  Knowledge is power.  You don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to change anything right now.  It doesn&#39;t even sound like things <br/>\nare that bad.  If you decide to start implementing changes, you&#39;ll <br/>\nalways find support here and I&#39;m sure in a lot of other places, too.   <br/>\nGood luck,  Heidi  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatrina Gutleben wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;Dh and I have food issues from different ends of the spectrum (although he<br/>\n&gt;would deny having issues at all).

He was adopted by the<br/>\n&gt;above mentioned controlling parents at age 9!!  Before that he grew up in a<br/>\n&gt;small fishing village in Korea, food was scarce there and he remembers that<br/>\n&gt;everyone got a bowl of rice and some chopsticks.  All the food was served<br/>\n&gt;&#39;family style&#39; which meant you snapped up one bite or so at a time and put<br/>\n&gt;it on your rice and ate it.  You learned to grab what you wanted and eat<br/>\n&gt;fast because it was first come first serve and the little kids were at a<br/>\n&gt;clear disadvantage.  All veggies were steamed or raw.  In between the two<br/>\n&gt;meals a day you were pretty much on your own to find edible things.  He<br/>\n&gt;tells stories of eating raw sea slugs from the bay and stealing fruits and<br/>\n&gt;veggies from neighbors yards.  Sweets were basically non existent except for<br/>\n&gt;some candies they would get from military people on rare occasion.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Now he hardly eats sweets at all.

I&#39;m better<br/>\n&gt;at limiting my overall intake of food while he&#39;s certainly better at<br/>\n&gt;limiting his sweets.  We both love veggies but I like a wider variety of<br/>\n&gt;cooking styles.  He has issues with the &#39;clean your plate&#39; thing that I<br/>\n&gt;don&#39;t have.

Broccoli is about the only<br/>\n&gt;veggie she will eat.  Big Bread eater.

LOVES ice cream!  Milk, eggs, seafood, will eat pasta but<br/>\n&gt;really loves meat.  Basically if it&#39;s an animal product he wants it.  Does<br/>\n&gt;not eat veggies except maybe broccoli ever 4th time or so.  EATS!  Like<br/>\n&gt;daddy that way.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;They both love fruit!  I don&#39;t know, I look at it all here in writing and it<br/>\n&gt;doesn&#39;t seem all that bad.  My issues are that I have a hard time buying the<br/>\n&gt;things they like.  DD loves yogurt and I have a hard time justifying it<br/>\n&gt;because it&#39;s like .50 a container.  Never mind that I buy pop which is about<br/>\n&gt;the same price and WAY less nutritious!!  Money has always been really tight<br/>\n&gt;and now hat It&#39;s not so much I&#39;m trying to work myself out of miser mode.<br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s hard.  before basically anything that varied from the menu just wasn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;going to get bought.  Now that money&#39;s not so much an issue it&#39;s like that<br/>\n&gt;thinking is still stuck in my head.  But now it&#39;s like someone else voice<br/>\n&gt;coming out of my mouth saying &#39;no&#39; to all requests.  I don&#39;t WANT to be like<br/>\n&gt;this!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;it&#39;s not just that way with food though.  I think it&#39;s from being the baby<br/>\n&gt;of 7.  Somewhere along the line I learned to be really miserly with money<br/>\n&gt;and have to &#39;justify&#39; every purchase.   Even when we have the money I have a<br/>\n&gt;hard time justifying spending it on things like that.  Then at the same time<br/>\n&gt;my &#39;weaker&#39; side that loves dining out and hates cooking will use the same<br/>\n&gt;money, I earlier denied my children, to take the whole family to dinner at<br/>\n&gt;Jack In The Box!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;So here are my problems in a nutshell.  DH is big on clean plates (but<br/>\n&gt;thinks that &#39;worked&#39; for him so it will work for our kids).  DH uses sweets<br/>\n&gt;as a reward (and denies them as punishment) I use them to celebrate a job<br/>\n&gt;well done and to show love.  I refuse requests for impulse purchases in the<br/>\n&gt;store.  Dh says things like &quot;You can chose to get this bag of chips (that I<br/>\n&gt;want as opposed to the ones you want) or nothing.&quot;  In both of our minds<br/>\n&gt;&#39;picky eating&#39; is a bad thing and &#39;good eaters&#39; are a good thing.  Pop both<br/>\n&gt;flows endlessly and is all caught up in power struggles in our home.  The<br/>\n&gt;only universally agreed upon veggie is broccoli (and we adults both like<br/>\n&gt;salad).  Everyone loves fruit but I hardly ever buy it because it&#39;s so damn<br/>\n&gt;expensive and it&#39;s all gone in the first 2 days!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Help, advice, comments, welcome!!!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Katie<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Your use of Yahoo!

Now that money&#39;s not so much an issue it&#39;s like that<br/>\nthinking is still stuck in my head.  But now it&#39;s like someone else voice<br/>\ncoming out of my mouth saying &#39;no&#39; to all requests.  I don&#39;t WANT to be like<br/>\nthis!<br/>\n<br/>\nit&#39;s not just that way with food though.  I think it&#39;s from being the baby<br/>\nof 7.  Somewhere along the line I learned to be really miserly with money<br/>\nand have to &#39;justify&#39; every purchase.   Even when we have the money I have a<br/>\nhard time justifying spending it on things like that.  Then at the same time<br/>\nmy &#39;weaker&#39; side that loves dining out and hates cooking will use the same<br/>\nmoney, I earlier denied my children, to take the whole family to dinner at<br/>\nJack In The Box!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are my problems in a nutshell.  DH is big on clean plates (but<br/>\nthinks that &#39;worked&#39; for him so it will work for our kids).  DH uses sweets<br/>\nas a reward (and denies them as punishment) I use them to celebrate a job<br/>\nwell done and to show love.  I refuse requests for impulse purchases in the<br/>\nstore.  Dh says things like &quot;You can chose to get this bag of chips (that I<br/>\nwant as opposed to the ones you want) or nothing.&quot;  In both of our minds<br/>\n&#39;picky eating&#39; is a bad thing and &#39;good eaters&#39; are a good thing.  Pop both<br/>\nflows endlessly and is all caught up in power struggles in our home.  The<br/>\nonly universally agreed upon veggie is broccoli (and we adults both like<br/>\nsalad).  Everyone loves fruit but I hardly ever buy it because it&#39;s so damn<br/>\nexpensive and it&#39;s all gone in the first 2 days!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp, advice, comments, welcome!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43106,"nextTopicId":43148}}
