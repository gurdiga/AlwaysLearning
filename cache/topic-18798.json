Liam (who s 9 now)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-73080485\">Hi, Joanna!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for this message.  I want you to know that I&#39;ve been thinking about <br/>\nSam, but I didn&#39;t know that this was his birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\nLiam (who&#39;s 9 now) asked me to make up a story the other morning when we <br/>\nwoke up at about 4 a.m.  We were lying in bed talking and not wanting to <br/>\nturn on the light and read, so Liam asked me to make up a story.  I asked <br/>\nhim what he&#39;d like the story to be about and he said &quot;protest.&quot;  To make my <br/>\nvery long story not quite as long, I made up a story about a guy named <br/>\n&quot;Joe&quot; who had lost his connection with his spirit when he was a little kid <br/>\nbecause he had been driven real hard his whole life by his family and <br/>\nteachers and that kind of thing.  Joe ends up being president of the US, <br/>\nbut all the things he does while in office are pretty mean and awful and he <br/>\ngets the country into a war and a big financial mess and all <br/>\nthat.  Meanwhile, there are lots of protests going on all the time outside <br/>\nthe White House because so many people in the country are so unhappy with Joe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, there&#39;s this one little 9-year-old boy who&#39;s with his folks at one <br/>\nof the protests.  He wanders away to find a place to relieve himself and <br/>\nsomehow gets himself inside the White House (it couldn&#39;t happen, I know, <br/>\nbut it&#39;s a story!).  He gets real scared when he can&#39;t find his way back <br/>\nout and hides in a bathroom.  Turns out the prez has to relieve himself at <br/>\nabout that time, and finds this little boy hiding in the bathroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, Liam asked me the boy&#39;s name.  I thought a little bit, and I <br/>\nfigured Sam would be a good name.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, in the story, Joe and Sam meet at an opportune time for Joe, because <br/>\nhe sees himself in Sam and realizes that he had once had a connection to <br/>\nhis spirit the way Joe does now.  So, Sam and Joe talk for a while.  Joe <br/>\nwants to know what moved Sam and his folks to come to Washington and <br/>\nprotest.  Sam, in his eloquent, 9-year-old way, tells the prez what&#39;s been <br/>\neating him about the state of the union.  And, in a rare moment of empathy <br/>\nand compassion, Joe sees all that has been going on through a boy&#39;s <br/>\nperspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, Joe changes and things get much better.  It&#39;s a magic story.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards, I told Liam who Sam is.  It was wonderful to have Sam with us <br/>\nin the story for just a little bit.  Anyway, thanks for sharing Sam with <br/>\nus, and Happy Birthday to Sam!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 15:10 2/14/04, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;He&#39;d have been 10 years old today.
