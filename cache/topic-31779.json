For me personally, I don&#39;t mind there being kids in  <br/>\nthe room while I&#39;m speaking.  If a mom is rocking a restless toddler  <br/>\nor baby, that&#39;s fine with me.  Standing or sitting in back and  <br/>\nplaying with them doesn&#39;t bother me, as long as it&#39;s not bothering  <br/>\nthose who have come to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the main thing is courtesy for others.  If a child is crying,  <br/>\ngo outside with him so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the talk.  If he just wants  <br/>\nto crawl around, let him crawl around in the back.  If an older kid  <br/>\nis restless, give him paper and pens, maybe, and let him draw.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31778,"nextTopicId":31724}}
