Sometimes even I had to ask her to repeat things several times before I could figure out what she was saying.  Her speech is just fine now, with no therapy ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has also exhibited some traits that are associated with dyslexia.  It was in the back of my mind to &quot;do something&quot;, but I never did.  I live in WA state where we don&#39;t have to test - we can do an annual assessment instead.  I just write up a summary of the previous year and then file it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is 10 and a half and is rapidly improving with reading.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s been in the past few months that she is &quot;really reading&quot;.  Kind of early by some standards!  She does beautiful art work and arithmetic is fun and easy for her.  She learned to play cribbage last year and now wins nearly every game - even with her dad who has been playing for decades and is quite good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she had gone to school, she probably would have been shuffled off to speech therapy and special reading groups.

We decided not to let him do it through the school system and he is speaking just fine now.  As long as your friend&#39;s son has a chance to have conversations with people, I am sure he will be okay.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Chrissie<br/>\n<br/>\nMaggy Alonso &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:MaggyAlonso@...\">MaggyAlonso@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n  I recently met a single mom who is unschooling her 6 yo son.  She mentioned today that she has to go through the school board for the first year (she just moved to Florida from Chicago) because she wants to get him evaluated for speech at no cost to her.  I know someone else (now also an unschooler) who did this and had therapy recommended for 2 of her kids.  They hated the therapy and she hated the therapy so they quit after a short time.  Her kids got over their speech issues without the therapy.  This single mom is basing her son&#39;s need for evaluation on two separate occasions where it was suggested by other people (not professionals).  I&#39;m just wondering if anyone knows where she can get some info/support online before she has him evaluated.  I&#39;ve had conversations with her son and he sounds just fine to me.  I would love to be able to offer her an alternative to going through the school board.
