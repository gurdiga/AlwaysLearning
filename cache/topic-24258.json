Connecting with families with older children is great. Now I am the older more experienced unschooling family inspiring younger ones &lt;g&gt;.

If you are able to i would also strongly recommend attending an unschooling conference, either the Northeast in May this year or the Live and Learn conference in New Mexico in September.  After my dh attended his first Live and Learn conference he came home total on board.  He still occasionally slips up with questions like &quot;are you working on math or reading?&quot; but it&#39;s not an on going conflict.
