It does not sit right to tell kids not to hit each other and<br/>\nto be cooperative when you&#39;re playing Kill Stuff In A Good Story IV?<br/>\nIsn&#39;t that a contradiction?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*A:* It&#39;s been almost a FULL DAY, and Deb Lewis hasn&#39;t yet commented on<br/>\nviolence?! She must be out of town! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;ll be by shortly, I&#39;m sure....<br/>\n<br/>\nDuncan has a friend who was playing Nintendogs. He had 4-5 dogs, all<br/>\nhappy and well-cared for. He decided to starve one. He wanted to see<br/>\nhow far the game would go. He&#39;d feed the other dogs in front of it. It<br/>\nwould beg and whine. It grew thinner and thinner. Weaker and weaker.<br/>\nC-r-a-w-l-i-n-g along the floor. It did anything to get his attention.<br/>\nIt was so pathetic!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe moms were FREAKING OUT!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, Duncan *adores* his Nintendogs. He only keeps as many as he can<br/>\ncare for and got angry at Cameron&#39;s girlfriend, who played with his DS<br/>\nand bought another dog---but then went home after the weekend, leaving<br/>\n*her* new dog for Duncan to care for. &quot;Doesn&#39;t she realize that a dog&#39;s<br/>\na big responsibility? That she can&#39;t just *get* one and then forget<br/>\nabout it?&quot; So he&#39;s *very* attached to and cares a lot about his virtual<br/>\npets.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he also realizes that these are just pixels.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow...I don&#39;t really know what a &quot;pixel&quot; IS, but I do know that they<br/>\naren&#39;t real dogs. &lt;g&gt; Nevertheless, the boy who was starving his<br/>\nvirtual dog had my stomach in a knot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was experimenting with the GAME. He would *never* starve his own<br/>\nREAL dogs! I guess I *know* that in my mind, but my heart was breaking<br/>\nfor this starving pup...uh...pixel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think many adults have a hard time understanding that these are<br/>\nsimply games---NO ONE is getting hurt---not a soul! Nor would these<br/>\nchildren purposefully harm anyone IRL. But this a VIRTUAL world. Wild<br/>\nand crazy things can be done in a virtual world---things none of these<br/>\nchildren would ever *consider* doing in real life! They can be strong<br/>\nsuper-heroes and super-villains. They can starve sweet, little pups.<br/>\nThey can save and destroy planets. It&#39;s a GAME! Absolutley NO violence<br/>\nis being committed! Absolutely NO damage is being done!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand... &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent trivializes what a child holds dear or throws away or<br/>\nsells a child&#39;s game or denies a child time to play...then REAL damage<br/>\nis being done to that child and that relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe *parent* has the power over the child and is wielding it to suit<br/>\nthe parent. A child feels small and powerless. THAT&#39;s real damage! A<br/>\nparent that spanks or pops or smacks or paddles or whips a<br/>\nchild---THAT&#39;s real violence!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the children that DO play violent games and then go out and<br/>\nshoot up a school?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that those children were loved and accepted for Who They<br/>\nAre by everyone close to them? Or do you think they were laughed at and<br/>\nridiculed and coerced and denied and trumped on a regular basis? Do you<br/>\nthink they were trusted and respected and treasted with kindness and<br/>\npatience and generosity? Or do you think their parents wished they<br/>\ncould fix or change them---or just wish that they were *different*?<br/>\n<br/>\nColumbine shooters don&#39;t get that way because they were allowed to play<br/>\nvideo games. They get that way because the people who should have loved<br/>\nthem most didn&#39;t treat them with respect and kindness and accept that<br/>\nWho They Are was good enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve met almost all the kids whose parents write here regularly. Not an<br/>\naxe-murderer among them! &lt;G&gt; Gentle, kind, thoughtful kids who love to<br/>\nkill and starve pixels. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Might over Right will get you short-term results. Using Right<br/>\nover Might takes a little longer---more thought, more patience, more<br/>\nwork!---but it&#39;s a life-long relationship you&#39;re after, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games don&#39;t cause violent children. But children who are exposed<br/>\nto real violence *very* often become violent.<br/>\n**<br/>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n*Q: *Someone mentioned is it right to give up something because it causes<br/>\ngrumpiness? If it made someone grumpy for my to pick my nose in front<br/>\nof them, yes I would need to give that up to fit in with manners.<br/>\n-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n*A: *Picking your nose in public is considered bad manners in this society.<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter whether it makes someone grumpy or not. What *YOU* do<br/>\ncannot make *ME* grumpy. I get to *choose* how *I* feel about<br/>\neverything. *YOU* are not responsible for *MY* feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother used to say, &quot;You make me embarrassed when you do ________.&quot;<br/>\nUh....No. I can&#39;t *make* her be embarrassed. *She* gets to make the<br/>\ndecision whether to be embarrassed or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying video games doesn&#39;t *make* someone else feel grumpy. There&#39;s<br/>\nsomething *else* going on there. There are other options than simply<br/>\nlimited gaming time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n*********************************************************************************************************<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] video game advice","postDate":"1205733537","msgId":33134,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVJT01QQUMuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyODUzNC42NjQwOC5xbUB3ZWI1MTMwOS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":33133,"nextInTopic":33135,"prevInTime":33133,"nextInTime":33135,"topicId":10443,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... showing as he plays, yelling, calling names, ... occasions where he s used the same type of aggression while dealing with other non-game things (although","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1221240280\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;It&#39;s not really the game that is bugging me but the aggression my son is<br/>\n </span></blockquote>showing as he plays, yelling, calling names,<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;threatening etc. I know he&#39;s just playing a game but there have been<br/>\n </span></blockquote>occasions where he&#39;s used the same type of aggression &gt;&gt;while dealing with<br/>\nother non-game things (although not to the same extent).
