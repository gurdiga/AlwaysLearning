I was designing the<br/>\nlighting and Jocelyn was designing costumes. One of the pieces used the song<br/>\n&quot;We Didn&#39;t Start the Fire &quot; by Billy Joel.  It was not much of a dance,  but<br/>\nthe soundtrack was intriguing.   The piece had a live band.  The first<br/>\nrehearsal Jocelyn saw it was with just the band, nobody singing the lyrics.<br/>\nThis is this the song where Joel lists major events and people from the<br/>\nfifties to the late &#39;80s in rapid-fire.  So without a singer and with pretty<br/>\nho-hum choreography, it was pretty dull.  The next rehearsal Jocelyn saw was<br/>\nwith the singer and she found it far more interesting.  She wasn&#39;t familiar<br/>\nwith the song so she did some research on the Internet and came up with<br/>\nthese two links.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.springfield.k12.il.us/movie/fire.html\">http://www.springfield.k12.il.us/movie/fire.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.teacheroz.com/fire.htm\">http://www.teacheroz.com/fire.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe first one is to a site some teachers in Springfield Illinois put<br/>\ntogether. It contains a QuickTime video that flashes pictures of all the<br/>\nevents in rhythm to the lyrics.  The second site lists all the lyrics and<br/>\nhas links in the lyrics to various sites that give you information on the<br/>\nsubject of the lyric.<br/>\nSo there I was watching this video, several times, and being amazed at much<br/>\nmore I was getting out of it each time I viewed it with the visuals.  I was<br/>\nlooking at the linked site clicking on names I wasn&#39;t familiar with.  I was<br/>\npicking up facts about Santayana and a Prokhorov.  Then my son Matthew<br/>\nwalked in.  He had been to a rehearsal or two and had seen the dance. I<br/>\nasked him if he&#39;d seen the video and he said his mother had showed it to him<br/>\nthe day before. He asked what I was doing and I showed him the link site and<br/>\nhow cool it was to instantly go to information about the song lyrics. In a<br/>\nflash he sat down next to me and we were quickly clicking to information<br/>\nabout Peyton Place and Princess Grace and Khrushchev and Dien Bien Phu and<br/>\nJosef Stalin and Bernie Goetz.  He particularly liked the the link to<br/>\nLiberace and &quot; crying all the way to the bank.&quot; We then discussed the<br/>\npossibility of visiting the Liberace museum next time we were anywhere near<br/>\nLas Vegas.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there we were, reaching for an abbreviated history of the last half of<br/>\nthe 20th-century with a decade-old popular tune and a Web browser.<br/>\nJocelyn had a drive to learn more about this popular tune that she couldn&#39;t<br/>\nbelieve she hadn&#39;t known about. I was captivated that adding the visual<br/>\nelement to the lyrics made them far more recognizable to me. Matthew was<br/>\nimpressed at the depth to each of the historical elements that were just<br/>\nwords in a song, and tickled at how quickly we had access to it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, in one of those grand coincidences, we were watching the Simpsons last<br/>\nnight and the tag to the clip show that was aired was a parody of this song!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis &quot;always learning&quot; talk makes so much sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6386,"nextTopicId":6397}}
