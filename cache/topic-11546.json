He started out as a janitor (cleaning toilets and mowing the grounds at another plant) and progressed to the actual molding of various items such as Christmas tree stands, those huge paper clip letter holder thingies, and even drinking cups.  He finds plastics utterly fascinating.  We cannot go anywhere without him letting us know exactly what type of plastic something is made of......polystyrene, pvc, polypropolene, polyethelene, nylon, etc.....<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some things he suggested to find out more:<br/>\nPlastics News--he said it is a magazine but they might have a website<br/>\nSociety of Plastic Engineers---they should have a website<br/>\nAmerican Plastics Counsel--they do all of those commercials on tv<br/>\n<br/>\nHis favorite statement is &quot;plastic is our friend&quot; and he uses it fairly often.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKimber in AR<br/>\nThe Robbins&#39; Nest<br/>\nds Alex (9) and dd Mady (6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] PLASTIC!!","postDate":"1042221327","msgId":11555,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwZmIwMWMyYjhkMSRmNWU1MGRhMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE3OS4xNDRlOWZhZS4yYjUwNWVkZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":11554,"nextInTopic":11556,"prevInTime":11554,"nextInTime":11556,"topicId":11546,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thank you for the clarification (SHEEPISH grin) Mary Ellen ...

(I bet you didn&#39;t know there WAS one! Neither did I.) &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I read ONE MORE WORD of what you wrote, I want to say this:<br/>\n<br/>\nI love plastics.  Not I love plastic things, but I&#39;m fascinated in an <br/>\nignorant way with the differences in the way different vinyls feel, in the <br/>\nstuff milk-gallon &quot;bottles&quot; are made of.  Of Lego vs. the other harder, cheap <br/>\nknock-off stuff.  I don&#39;t understand enough chemistry to read anything <br/>\ntechnical about plastics engineering but of all the sciences that is the one <br/>\nthat calls to me.  Like some people want to go to Hawaii (I never have wanted <br/>\nto), I want to know more about plastics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the desert, some plastics just die at some point.  Their life is done.  <br/>\nToo much dry heat, and one season the whole thing (toy or dashboard of a car <br/>\nor moulding on a tool or something) just cracks and falls apart.  Kind of the <br/>\nway glue on old paperbacks from the 1960&#39;s or 70&#39;s just dies one year and <br/>\nthat&#39;s that.   Then there are some plastics which seem not to have that <br/>\nproblem.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we went to Indiana years ago for a homeschooling slumber party (an <br/>\ne-mail loop decided to get together and eight (?) families met in Indiana at <br/>\na big house for a long weekend) I had requested a trip to a plastics factory, <br/>\nbut the hostess didn&#39;t think I was serious.  And there might not have been <br/>\nany anyway.  I think there are in Illinois, and in Missouri, but Indiana <br/>\nseemed to have corn fields like Texas has oil wells--in every vacant lot and <br/>\nalong every roadway.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now having confessed my fascination, maybe some of you will find a little <br/>\nflyer or a website or something that will give my plastic-loving soul a <br/>\nthrill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the most wonderful plastic (vinyl) I have ever touched was some soft baby <br/>\ntoys from Finland, I think, that Discovery Toys used to sell.  We had an <br/>\nelephant and a giraffe, and I&#39;ve never known finer manufactured material.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also interested in the &quot;lumber&quot; made out of recycled trash bags.  Our <br/>\ncity busstop benches here are made of it, and in Alamogordo there&#39;s a big <br/>\nwooden kids&#39; playground, but the boardwalks are made with that plastic wood.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know how long it will last in the sun in the heat in Alamogordo, but <br/>\nit has the feel of outlasting real wood at least ten times over.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11613,"nextTopicId":11645}}
