Not just coming out to other people, but discovering one has an &quot;atypical&quot; sexuality and learning to deal with that involves actively looking for other examples of other people who are similar. For gay men, in particular, the sight of men kissing other men has a gigantic personal impact - don&#39;t forget that straight men sometimes engage in male-on-male sexual behavior, and that&#39;s part of the mix. A truism of the gay community is that straight men will put out, but they won&#39;t kiss you. So kissing and sensual behavior is part of what defines &quot;gay sex&quot;. In pornography, it&#39;s a way of implying the sex is &quot;real&quot;. It validates the &quot;money shot&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sep 14, 2012, at 4:00 PM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I explained that hardcore porn objectifies women and is not<br/>\n&gt; &gt; always a realistic demonstration of what happens in an intimate sexual relationship.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Perhaps one of the draws of the pornography on the internet is that he found it.

When he&#39;s older, and ready for a relationship he will care so it&#39;s good he has access to both.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; BUT, again, men actually seem to be wired to need the physical side in their porn. The emotional side is not part of it. At least not in the porn. Generally.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There&#39;s a -- clean! -- story behind that observation ;-) I&#39;ve been drawing a comic for a while and one panel needed a couple locked in a sensual kiss. And I discovered it&#39;s *astonishingly* hard to find clear pictures of that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; During the extensive search I realized two things:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1) Heterosexual men&#39;s porn has no kissing. Men, in fact, hardly even appear in the porn. The only part of the man that&#39;s important is his equipment. ;-) And for the woman, her part is to appear to be deriving physical pleasure from whatever the male equipment is doing to her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s the biochemistry your son is dealing with. Obviously heterosexual men do kiss in real life! :-) It&#39;s just they don&#39;t need it in their porn. So porn isn&#39;t about lovemaking.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And 2) Gay men&#39;s porn has kissing! (It&#39;s where I finally found my clear pictures ;-) There&#39;s other kinds of sensual touching depicted, not just the pleasuring of equipment ;-) Which I thought was very interesting! It suggests different biochemistry.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 3) I have no idea if there&#39;s actual lesbian porn. What&#39;s readily available of women together is probably for heterosexual men since it&#39;s all focused on physical pleasure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And 4) -- which is separate from the kissing picture research -- many women enjoy reading stories, reading graphic novels of men falling in love with each other and having very graphic sex. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s existed forever, but it &quot;came out of the closet&quot; in the late 70&#39;s when women were able to share their fantasies on line beginning with Star Trek slash fiction between Kirk and Spock ;-)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sexually speaking, why would women want to read and look at men falling in love and having sex? Biologically speaking it&#39;s a dead end ;-) But the market for &quot;boy&#39;s love&quot; graphic novels (yaoi) is huge. (Google it :-) What&#39;s interesting is generally the men aren&#39;t gay. Partly because it would make the relationships too easy! ;-) But -- and I&#39;ve pondered this for quite a while  ;-) -- I think it has to do with the fact that for the men to fall in love with each other it requires a massive drop of any emotional barriers. I&#39;m guessing women get turned on by emotional vulnerability in men.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What it all comes down to is that sexuality is way more complex than it seems it needs to be ;-) What people like for arousal purposes doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with what they enjoy doing in real life. How many women who enjoyed the early bodice busters where the women were generally raped initially by their eventual husbands, wanted to be raped themselves? If their moms had known exactly what they were reading, would they have been worried about their future ability to have loving sex?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Joyce<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":224796703,"authorName":"otherstar","from":"&quot;otherstar&quot; &lt;otherstar@...&gt;","profile":"casouthworth","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Touchy topic; some won&#39;t want to read this","postDate":"1347722682","msgId":69068,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQ3ODEwMkQwNjE1QjRCRjJCRDM1RDE0OTg2MDlCRkY5QExhcHB5SFA+","inReplyToHeader":"PDUzNzI4ODBDLUZBRDgtNEE5Ri1BOUY5LTI0MTkzQjFCREE1NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGszMTBrdCs1MXN0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTM3Mjg4MEMtRkFEOC00QTlGLUE5RjktMjQxOTNCMUJEQTU1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69067,"nextInTopic":69070,"prevInTime":69067,"nextInTime":69069,"topicId":69054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are boys spanked/whipped, for looking at dirty pictures (by good Christian dads... not healthy).  There are boys who lose all computer privileges, are grounded, forbidden to see the friends they saw porn with/from, for months or a year.  HUGE over-reactions, in my opinion.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut here is something that can and probably should be said to any unschooled boy who seems too interested in internet porn:  If someone outside the family got wind of it and knew the parents weren&#39;t trying to prevent it, or that the parents had condoned or contributed, that could be trouble with social workers or laws.  There are laws in the U.S. (I don&#39;t know about other places) about adults viewing porn with a child, even a young adult with an older teen.  Sex-offender laws, I mean, which can have (in New Mexico, anyway) repercussions for life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my kids, when there were things that were UNACCEPTABLE in mainstream life, I would point out that I didn&#39;t think it was worth getting in trouble with the state about, and we weren&#39;t registered homeschoolers for most of those years, and I wanted to stay fairly quiet.

(It&#39;s divided up usually by 2 year spans.) Check this ASAP. The programs should be starting soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was an interesting article in the New York Times about a (regular!) business woman who realized her younger lovers had learned a lot of their moves from pornography. She was inspired to create a website where people could upload videos of actual lovemaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpreading the Word (and Pictures) on ‘Real’ Sex<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/fashion/cindy-gallops-online-effort-to-promote-real-not-porn-fed-sex.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/fashion/cindy-gallops-online-effort-to-promote-real-not-porn-fed-sex.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou might want to read him the beginning of it to let him know that women can tell the difference between lovemaking and pornography and aren&#39;t too pleased with the results. ;-) It will be useful information for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, I suspect right now at 11 the sensual side of it doesn&#39;t interest him. It&#39;s the physical side. ( But it&#39;s not good, as in the article, if their understanding of the mechanics of sex comes strictly from porn.) When he&#39;s older, and ready for a relationship he will care so it&#39;s good he has access to both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBUT, again, men actually seem to be wired to need the physical side in their porn. The emotional side is not part of it. At least not in the porn. Generally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a -- clean! -- story behind that observation ;-) I&#39;ve been drawing a comic for a while and one panel needed a couple locked in a sensual kiss. And I discovered it&#39;s *astonishingly* hard to find clear pictures of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring the extensive search I realized two things:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Heterosexual men&#39;s porn has no kissing. Men, in fact, hardly even appear in the porn. The only part of the man that&#39;s important is his equipment. ;-) And for the woman, her part is to appear to be deriving physical pleasure from whatever the male equipment is doing to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s the biochemistry your son is dealing with. Obviously heterosexual men do kiss in real life! :-) It&#39;s just they don&#39;t need it in their porn. So porn isn&#39;t about lovemaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 2) Gay men&#39;s porn has kissing! (It&#39;s where I finally found my clear pictures ;-) There&#39;s other kinds of sensual touching depicted, not just the pleasuring of equipment ;-) Which I thought was very interesting! It suggests different biochemistry.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I have no idea if there&#39;s actual lesbian porn. What&#39;s readily available of women together is probably for heterosexual men since it&#39;s all focused on physical pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 4) -- which is separate from the kissing picture research -- many women enjoy reading stories, reading graphic novels of men falling in love with each other and having very graphic sex. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s existed forever, but it &quot;came out of the closet&quot; in the late 70&#39;s when women were able to share their fantasies on line beginning with Star Trek slash fiction between Kirk and Spock ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSexually speaking, why would women want to read and look at men falling in love and having sex? Biologically speaking it&#39;s a dead end ;-) But the market for &quot;boy&#39;s love&quot; graphic novels (yaoi) is huge. (Google it :-) What&#39;s interesting is generally the men aren&#39;t gay. Partly because it would make the relationships too easy! ;-) But -- and I&#39;ve pondered this for quite a while  ;-) -- I think it has to do with the fact that for the men to fall in love with each other it requires a massive drop of any emotional barriers. I&#39;m guessing women get turned on by emotional vulnerability in men.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it all comes down to is that sexuality is way more complex than it seems it needs to be ;-) What people like for arousal purposes doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with what they enjoy doing in real life. How many women who enjoyed the early bodice busters where the women were generally raped initially by their eventual husbands, wanted to be raped themselves? If their moms had known exactly what they were reading, would they have been worried about their future ability to have loving sex?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Touchy topic; some won&#39;t want to read this","postDate":"1347652831","msgId":69054,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIzNTk5N0Y4LUUyRTMtNDg2My04RkYyLUQyNDlBRjZCNDU3NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69056,"prevInTime":69053,"nextInTime":69055,"topicId":69054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"NOTICE: This is about pornography, so anyone who thinks all porn is sin or should all be a crime should just read no more.

A few months ago I came across the fact that my eleven year old had been watching hardcore porn on the internet.   Anime porn, hardcore XXX porn, live webcams, gay, lesbian, gang bang…..etc.  When I spoke with him about the fact that I found porn sites on the computer he became very shy and quiet.  After a while he said that links came up when he played games on the internet and that he clicked them to see what they were.  He then said that he browsed them because he was curious.  I shared with him that there are many ways to satisfy ones curiosity about sex, one of which is hardcore porn, others being books, magazines, articles, soft core porn….  I offered to order resources for him to explore sex.  I explained that hardcore porn objectifies women and is not always a realistic demonstration of what happens in an intimate sexual relationship.  I also explained that sometimes it is what happens, that it just depended on the couple, but that I preferred that he learns about sex using other resources and not hardcore videos. I explained that I preferred he watch other more &quot;gentle&quot;, &quot;humanistic&quot;, &quot;intimate&quot; expressions / videos of sex. I strewed additional resources around the house, I bought Kama Sutra books with very explicit pictures and explanations, I also purchased Jaiya New World Sex Educator&#39;s video on sex, where besides video footage of couples having explicit sex, she also discusses intimacy, touch, arousal, erogenous zones…..etc.  I downloaded her video to his computer so he could feel free to watch it privately.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I browsed his history on the internet and noticed he had been watching hardcore porn again and going into live sex webcam rooms.  I looked at the history a bit more and noticed that he usually watches an hour to two every two or three days; that seems to be the pattern.  I am having a reaction about having hardcore porn be his introduction into the world of sex.  I feel that the visuals in hardcore porn are not appropriate for a child.  My husband and I spoke about it and we are almost at the point where we would like to ask him directly not to watch hardcore porn anymore (not state it as our preference this time, but a direct request to stop watching hardcore porn).  We would like to keep supplying him with internet links that show sex, and videos of sex, but not hardcore XXX stuff.  Can I make this non-negotiable request of him and not cause a &quot;behind your back&quot; phenomenon to start in our household?  Do I have the right as a parent to just stop him from something that causes no harm to anyone around him but that I don&#39;t like because I don&#39;t believe it is ok for an 11 year old?<br/>\n<br/>\n(anonymous person)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68980,"nextTopicId":69072}}
