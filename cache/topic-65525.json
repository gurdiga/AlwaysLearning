One of the big weaknesses in scientific studies is that the factors that can&#39;t be controlled can&#39;t be studied for what impact they&#39;re having. Scientists can most effectively study what can be quantified. Since that&#39;s mostly what they then study, it seems like what&#39;s quantifiable is what is most important.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith such complex &quot;systems&quot; as human beings, that isn&#39;t even close to being true. Researches can&#39;t control parenting and school in the kids they study so they can&#39;t say what effect either has.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers, though, can see the effect. The regular posters here have a philosophy in common that&#39;s guiding the nurturing of our kids&#39; living and learning. Using our kids as the control group, we can see more clearly than researchers (and schooling parents) the effects that conventional parenting and schooling have on kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think the EXISTENCE and cause of addiction is independent of<br/>\n&gt; environment. However, environment plays into WHO becomes addicted.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you read the Rat Park studies that were linked?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/protect\">http://sandradodd.com/protect</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe conclusions from those studies AND from what unschoolers see in their own kids is that an environment that isn&#39;t emotionally supportive and nurturing is the number one biggest factor in addiction. An environment that&#39;s deficient in what that person needs to feel whole injures them. If they have no control over what&#39;s injuring them, they can find temporary retreat from the pain or emptiness by withdrawing from the world. The withdraw might be alcohol, drugs, gambling, shopping, internet, video games, reading, exercise. Some of those are better at masking the pain and not so good at helping them cope. Some are not so good at masking but better at helping them cope. What damage they have will determine which they find most helpful. (Genetics and personality is a factor too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor some people, once they get out of the environment -- like the rats did -- they can let go of what they were using as an escape. But for some people, the damage is so great they end up carrying that environment with them internally -- such as messages about how worthless they are -- and they still need to escape even though they&#39;ve physically escaped what initially damaged them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while we all may to some degree (depending on the person) carry a mechanism for addiction, it isn&#39;t triggered unless the environment triggers it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like saying we all have a mechanism for coughing. But it&#39;s existence is irrelevant until our lungs get irritated and we need to clear them. It&#39;s irrelevant if we all have a mechanism for addiction if it doesn&#39;t kick in until the environment causes a need for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: pathological videogaming?","postDate":"1329333731","msgId":65587,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNVmFBRVNuRzNHN1EtMXJtRUwwcS1HYUZlQnNxZVc2NXZ5djg9a3JjX3N2UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpoZ3J1MitycmVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY1MTUwM0UxLUVENjUtNDk2My1CODlDLTlCQjM5N0IzQzFFOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGpoZ3J1MitycmVqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65583,"nextInTopic":65589,"prevInTime":65586,"nextInTime":65588,"topicId":65525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Wed, Feb 15, 2012 at 10:01 AM, ftb2_ss  wrote: I am not suggesting nor did I state either one.

Some substances cause the need for more use, regardless of a continued desire for the substance, BUT NOT ALWAYS (the twins for instance). When the body cries for more and the person complies even though it will cause harm without the previous pleasure, and the drive for more is just to delay the pain of withdrawal, I consider that physical addiction; when the person requires an ever increasing quantity of the substance to achieve the same results; when removal of the substance causes physical symptoms such as DT&#39;s, nervousness, heartbeat and blood pressure changes for instance. When removal of the substance can cause death before detoxification.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsychological addiction would be when someone is compelled to perform some activity and to cease it would cause anxiety, anger, hostility and and the need to continue, but not physical symptoms of withdrawal. Also, the activity may no longer bring pleasure, but the need to continue is born of the need to win just one more time, or the belief that one&#39;s luck is bound to change imminently. The gamer may feel that he is being wronged in some way, that everyone else is cheating, or the designers made the game to specifically defeat the player, yet he is compelled to keep playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The original cause of the behavior is the same, (pleasure),but the mechanism compelling continued use is not.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231415297,"authorName":"chris ester","from":"chris ester &lt;chris.homeschool@...&gt;","profile":"chris_e_bear","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: pathological videogaming?","postDate":"1329324785","msgId":65576,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTXVqbWRzUEhQUE1RaWlVdHZGdTktbWNWWVBTMHBZRXhPWFJwTkVtVU1KZlNyTUN2Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpoZ2tmOCs4Y3MzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpoZjVwbitmbXF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8amhna2Y4KzhjczNAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65575,"nextInTopic":65577,"prevInTime":65575,"nextInTime":65577,"topicId":65525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Wed, Feb 15, 2012 at 10:54 AM, tandosmama@bellsouth.net ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1793250938\">On Wed, Feb 15, 2012 at 10:54 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tandosmama@...\">tandosmama@...</a> &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tandosmama@...\">tandosmama@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What makes any of our lives full and rich is individual and personal.<br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t think another person can decide for us. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think it is important to keep exploring your view of what makes you<br/>\nhappy, successful, etc.  Friends of mine and my husband&#39;s left college<br/>\nbefore completing their degrees.  They proceeded to get jobs, a career, a<br/>\nhouse, a great marriage, kids, rich social life, and all of the stuff that<br/>\nlooks successful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have two beautiful daughters now.   They are constantly checking to<br/>\nsee what grades the girls have earned on each assignment and asking them<br/>\nwhat they (the girls) do to bring their already high grades up.  They then<br/>\nstate that they don&#39;t pressure their kids....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they discuss their hopes for their girls&#39; futures, they constantly<br/>\ntalk about how their kids won&#39;t &#39;screw up&#39; in college like they did.  This,<br/>\nin spite of the fact that they have the middle class lifestyle without the<br/>\ncollege debt.  Whereas my husband and I envy them their financial piece of<br/>\nmind because they started out with less debt because they didn&#39;t pay for<br/>\ncollege and went out and got their careers anyway.  These two successful<br/>\npeople can&#39;t see their own success because of one perceived failure.  And<br/>\ntheir own self esteem issues are now having a major effect on their<br/>\nchildren.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my goals as an unschooler is to somehow help my kids figure out<br/>\ntheir criteria for &#39;success&#39;--which to me means  a happy, fulfilled life as<br/>\nyou perceive it, not as some other group defines it.   Another of my goals<br/>\nis to NOT project my own desires for life onto my children, I would have<br/>\nloved to have pursued the performing arts but didn&#39;t, my daughter is an<br/>\namazing performer (more talented than her mom), but I am not pushing her to<br/>\ngo further, do more, she chooses her performances and classes.  Lately, I<br/>\nhave been supporting her in cutting down on all that she is doing because<br/>\nwe are over scheduled--her words, not mine (though I was thinking it, I did<br/>\nmy best not to share my feelings)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Unfortunately children are often over-ruled by adults who think they<br/>\n&gt; know better.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Tori&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>One of the gifts that I have received through unschooling is to see just<br/>\nhow wise children can be when they are allowed to make their own choices<br/>\nwithout guilt or shame.  My mother would allow me choices, but if she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t agree, she would try to use guilt and shame to change my mind.  I<br/>\nhated that and it caused a lot of strife in our relationship when I was a<br/>\nteen.  I try to take joy in my kids&#39; making choices even if I have<br/>\nmisgivings.

Still, they weren&#39;t drunks, just inconsistent and thoughtless, unless and until they started looking around at other, clearer families and made a conscious effort to change, which most people in those meetings were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a person whose parents and grandparents were not alcoholics can develop a physical alcoholism if he drinks long enough, even though it might have started with habitual drinking to be cool, or to self-medicate for some physical or emotional pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think a person can become physically addicted to video games, no matter how much he plays them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to say a person is addicted to video games seems to be wrong anyway.

What&#39;s interesting though is that addiction doesn&#39;t happen as readily when people are content and fulfilled, and not already experiencing a sense of deep lack. There are studies (written in perfect scientific language) that show that environment causes addiction, not substances.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may find the work of Gabor Mate interesting as well as that of Bruce Alexander, an addictions researcher who discovered that if rats were given a glorious rat-heaven environment, you couldn&#39;t keep them from NOT detoxing from otherwise addictive substances. In the Rat Park study, rats who were housed in fulfilling habitats, with lots of fun rat things to do and other rats to socialize with, willingly left alone sugar and heroin laced water in favor of plain H2O--even the rats who had previously addicted to the drug!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/\">http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.12-health-rat-trap/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPeter Gray recently pointed out that many people make the mistake off relating gambling to playing video games when talking about psychological addictions--the two acts are nothing at all alike though, and that is exactly where the argument falls short.  Gambling is playing on chance. Video gaming is based on skill.  Here&#39;s an excerpt from his article, the rest of which can be found here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201202/video-game-addiction-does-it-occur-if-so-why\">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201202/video-game-addiction-does-it-occur-if-so-why</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;The flawed analogy between gambling addiction and &quot;video game addiction&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAddiction is a word that is used in a variety of ways, but generally it refers to a compulsive (hard-to-resist) drive to take some substance or engage in some activity that is clearly not good for us and may even be ruining our lives. The clearest examples of addiction, of course, are chemical addictions, where people become physiologically dependent on some chemical--such as alcohol, nicotine, or heroine--and experience painful or debilitating withdrawal symptoms without it. But increasingly, and with some good reason, psychologists have begun to apply the term addiction to harmful behaviors that seem to become compulsive even though no chemical is consumed. Perhaps the best example of this is addictive gambling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people suffer--and their families do too--because they can&#39;t seem to stop gambling. They gamble away all of their money, and then they borrow and gamble more and go deeply into debt; and then, when they can&#39;t borrow any more, they might steal and gamble that away, too, in a desperate, doomed attempt to get out of debt and save themselves and their families from ruin. People who feel compelled to gamble may do it because they see no other possible route out of their debts and/or because of the thrill that comes whenever they win, which motivates them to seek that thrill again. Compulsive gambling is a very serious and prevalent problem, although this hasn&#39;t prevented state legislatures from promoting gambling (in the form of casinos as well as state lotteries) in order to add to state coffers and reduce the taxes that non-gamblers have to pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany if not most researchers who support the concept of video game addiction draw an analogy between video game playing and gambling. In fact, much of the research purporting to assess the prevalence of video game addiction--including the much-touted recent study conducted in Singapore [2]--has employed the same questionnaire that is used to assess the prevalence of gambling addiction, changing only the word &quot;gambling&quot; to &quot;video gaming.&quot; The analogy may be tempting to people who don&#39;t know much about video gaming. From a distance, playing a video game looks a little like gambling at a video screen in a casino. But think of the differences!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, most gambling games--especially the ones that people become addicted to--are pure games of chance (for all except the very few who figure out some way to cheat). They are rigged in such a way that over the long run you will always lose, but in the short run you will sometimes win. There is excellent research indicating that the random, unpredictable nature of these rewards operates on the brains of some people to promote behavior that might reasonably be called addictive.[3 ] The irrational &quot;thinking&quot; that accompanies the behavior and cannot be refuted is this: &quot;The very next time I pull the lever I could hit the jackpot, so I&#39;ll pull it one more time.&quot; ... and then one more time, and one more time, and one more time, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, video games are games of skill. They are like chess or any other game in which success depends on perseverance, intelligence, practice, and learning, not chance. The rewards are not random; they are earned. To move up to the next level you have to work hard. Moreover, the rewards in video games, as in chess, are purely in-game rewards (unless you are competing in a tournament for prize money). They are rewarding only because they signal mastery. Winning in these games doesn&#39;t produce real-world riches; and, more to the point, failing in these games doesn&#39;t lead to debt. This is why video games and chess are truly play, while gambling is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to imagine why anyone with a grain of intelligence would spend lots of time gambling unless something irrational was driving him or her to it. Considered as a game, gambling is just dumb. It requires no skill or intelligence whatsoever. You just keep doing the same stupid thing over and over again and sometimes you win and usually you don&#39;t. There&#39;s no legitimate sense of mastery. I can imagine some healthy people--who have extra cash to throw away and can&#39;t think of anything better to do with it--gambling occasionally, just as a lark; but to spend hours a week at gambling is almost by definition pathological. So, it is reasonable to posit that otherwise intelligent people who spend lots of time gambling must have some sort of irrational compulsion to do it, for which the term &quot;addiction&quot; may be an appropriate label.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so for video games or chess or other games that depend on skill and knowledge. The more you play these the more skill and knowledge you gain and the better you get at the game (and at anything else that uses similar skills or knowledge). You learn from your mistakes, and the more you play the better you get. So, playing these games a lot does not necessarily imply addiction; it just means that you are really into the game and enjoy it and are trying to get better at it. If you don&#39;t think that video gaming involves knowledge and intelligence, take a look at the online compendium of information associated with just one game, World of Warcraft--WoWwike. It&#39;s the second largest compendium of knowledge that can be found online! The first largest is Wikipedia. (I thank my colleague Mike Langlois for this bit of information.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome researchers who should know better have based their claim for the addictive nature of video gaming on brain research. If you do a little tooling around the Psychology Today blogs, you will find that one or more of my fellow bloggers are among those who have made this claim. Yes, indeed, functional brain imaging studies have shown that certain so-called &quot;pleasure pathways&quot; in the brain light up when gamblers hit the jackpot, and these same pathways also light up when video gamers achieve some goal within the game. Well, of course they do! If they didn&#39;t, that would just mean that hitting the jackpot or achieving success in a game isn&#39;t pleasurable. Everything that is pleasurable is pleasurable because of activity in pleasure centers of the brain.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] pathological videogaming?","postDate":"1329239232","msgId":65543,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDREE4N0EzLTY4RUItNDkwNy05QzEwLUVCMDQxOUE1RDhDMEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpoZHZobyszY285QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpoZHZobyszY285QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65540,"nextInTopic":65546,"prevInTime":65542,"nextInTime":65544,"topicId":65525,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
