No thanks to reading their webpages or calling their <br/>\nsalesman! &lt;bg!&gt;  I&#39;m reading more responses on parental blocks here and I&#39;m <br/>\nagreeing that having them is not only so limiting to us and our kids, they are also <br/>\na big pain in the butt and something I don&#39;t want to deal with. Not only <br/>\nthat, there is no way I would ever pay for something like that, especially on a <br/>\nmonthly basis. Parental controls on our internet service limit you so bad it&#39;s <br/>\nridiculous. We do explore the internet together with our kids and talk about <br/>\nthe things they may not want to encounter there all the time but they don&#39;t <br/>\nalways want us sitting there with them every time they get on and I don&#39;t blame <br/>\nthem for that. It&#39;s not that they are doing anything wrong, I know it&#39;s just <br/>\nthat they enjoy that freedom, and rightfully so. We have only had the Internet in <br/>\nour house for a little over a yr. now (yes we&#39;re slow, we always just went to <br/>\nthe library or the kids used it at school) so this is still a learning <br/>\nprocess for us. We&#39;ve also only been un/hsing for just over a year also. Thanks for <br/>\nthe &quot;free advice&quot; &lt;g&gt; I guess we just need more time...with the Internet and <br/>\nUNschooling. :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24956,"nextTopicId":24990}}
