I don&#39;t want to sound like a public service<br/>\nannouncement.... BUT, one way to give all of you a sense of control is to<br/>\nhave an emergency plan, maybe even several for different types of<br/>\nemergencies.  There are lots of good suggestions on the homeland security<br/>\nweb site and they aren&#39;t too &quot;here comes armegeddon&quot; (if you get my<br/>\nmeaning).  Learning about weather in general and dangerous weather in<br/>\nspecific  AND the real risks--lots more people are hurt by cars than<br/>\ntornadoes, may go a long way to quell fears.  We learned about how to<br/>\nrecognize tornado warnings and sounds and I am in Maryland (hardly tornado<br/>\nalley) when I was in school.  You might also want to look at the history of<br/>\nwhen tornadoes hit and where on the national weather service site and see<br/>\nthat very few tornadoes occur where you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying out the incident, if she chooses, is one way to normalize an<br/>\nincident and to allow her to process the feelings.  I was a therapist back<br/>\nin another life.  Let her be the driver of the play.  Certainly let her know<br/>\nthat talking about it and telling the story is okay, and the feelings are<br/>\nokay.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can learn about different kinds of wind--I would get a wind toy, and you<br/>\ncan use an electric fan or a/c, blow on it or take it outside and see if it<br/>\nwill move.  Talk about how only natural wind comes from a tornado and that<br/>\nthey are very rare.  Don&#39;t try to paint the truth better or worse, but the<br/>\nfacts are really not that bad since even with the increased activity that<br/>\nthey predict tornadoes are still very rare in your area.  You might be able<br/>\nto find stories about tornado alley and talk about how many people have<br/>\nlived there for years through lots of tornadoes and have been able to tell<br/>\nthe tale because of careful planning and alertness.  Learning about the<br/>\nwarning systems that are in your area would probably be good for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I am sure that she will be able to move on and have a normal<br/>\nlife, I would think that it could take a few months, maybe even 6, but<br/>\nprobably less.<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fri, Jul 22, 2011 at 6:02 PM, plaidpanties666<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:plaidpanties666@...\">plaidpanties666@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;celines s&quot; &lt;sanchezcelines@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt;now my daughter had develop this fear of wind and thunders<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And you haven&#39;t?
