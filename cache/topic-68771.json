When a couple of little kids are allllll excited about something you stop them, make them set aside their joy and enthusiasm, and give them a lesson in first/last? Ouch. That&#39;s not much different than saying &quot;no-one gets to be first until you all behave&quot; especially for any child who doesn&#39;t do well with that sort of talky lessoning. It&#39;s a heartbreaking response to childish enthusiasm.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; First, it difuses any power-play or competition hanging in the air.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No, it establishes the teacher firmly in the position of power and the lesson as more important than the desires and feelings of children. No-one gets to do Anything until everyone gives the proper responses. And that has never once been shown to diminish competition, ever. It just happens behind the teacher&#39;s back or mom&#39;s back, and the pecking order is determined with only the skills possessed by very young children: as soon as mom turns her back, you&#39;re going down. It doesn&#39;t help kids learn to work things out or solve problems - it shows them very, very clearly that the Last person they want to share their interpersonal problems with is the teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; Second, it can move us toward &quot;svadyaya&quot; a yoga term for learning about self through looking inward<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly if the students choose to look inward - and if they&#39;re trying to find the &quot;right answer&quot; so they can get back to what&#39;s really important to them (who gets to sit by the window?) they&#39;re not looking inward at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the great fallacies of teaching - that teaching creates learning. It doesn&#39;t. Sometimes people will choose to learn from teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something my brother wrote on Facebook recently on the subject of reading, but it could just as easily apply to teaching kids to &quot;look inward&quot; (or anything else):<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;Often I did &quot;hate to read&quot;. The goal in school, was to read x number of pages per day or finish the book and write something about it before I could do something else. That made reading the obstacle to the real goal, &quot;Do something else&quot;. It was a chore.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I found really interesting stuff, I&#39;d piss my teachers off. My 6th grade poetry reading of The Cremation of Sam McGee was less than well received due to subject matter. I ruined lesson plans by doing things like reading ahead and knowing how the story turns out, having memorized The Jabberwocky when the task for the day is unscrambling the jumbled lines, killing an hour long discussion about what does the book tile mean by pointing out Beelzebub is Hebrew for Lord of the Flys, etc. I was a problem whether I was being an underachiever or exceeding expectations.

The biggest mistake adults make in communicating with children is thinking it&#39;s about talking - asking or telling. Start sooner and further back: listen, watch, notice patterns and tendencies. Kids communicate in a hundred different ways that don&#39;t involve words. One of the advantages of unschooling is that you have time for the quiet, observational parts of communication. You get to learn about your kids without asking or telling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes asking is useful, but when a child answers &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or gives you a blank look, that&#39;s Not telling you he or she wants a lesson. A lot of the time it means you&#39;re asking the wrong question and need to step back, look and listen some more. Sometimes, in the moment when you don&#39;t know what to do and your child doesn&#39;t either, it&#39;s okay to guess and try something and see what happens - that&#39;s part of learning, too!<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":340966713,"authorName":"daisy_soft","from":"&quot;daisy_soft&quot; &lt;dcbbooks@...&gt;","profile":"puckpeaches","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Me First!","postDate":"1345993895","msgId":68792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsxZGViNytzajRlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxYzhtOCszZG9lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68790,"nextInTopic":68795,"prevInTime":68791,"nextInTime":68793,"topicId":68771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"**** (I was the last child in an Italian catholic family, so I ve mastered being last .

Giving ourselves more time to negotiate these situations is immensely helpful. Also, I try to anticipate potential me first situations and ask ahead of time “Who wants to go first?” That way, we have it worked out before we ever get to the door or the car. With the car, we each have our own spots. It worked out that way because of the car seats. Each person’s spot has her stuff in it so that there is no need to argue about who is going to sit where. Sometimes, I will step in and advocate for the child that doesn’t get to go first as much. Yesterday, my 8 year old wanted to go inside first so she asked her little sister, “Is it okay if I go in first this time?” and her little sister said it was fine. I try to help them be mindful of each other and take turns. In order to do that, I have to build in lots of extra time and take things slowly. Me firsts are a lot harder to navigate when you are in a hurry and pressed for time. One of the other things that I have done is do-overs. When leaving, we can take turns being out the door first. Another possibility is encouraging them to hold hands so that they can all be first together. I don’t rely on any one solution but have several options so that I can assess the situation and make suggestions accordingly. <br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439496203,"authorName":"Vicky Woods","from":"Vicky Woods &lt;vmwoods@...&gt;","profile":"vic_woods","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Me First!","postDate":"1345983802","msgId":68786,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTE0NS1kczE1OEY0RDgzMUVCQkIyN0RDMjQyMDJCNEEzMEBwaHguZ2JsPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxYzhtOCszZG9lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGsxOWpxdiszbTF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8azFjOG04KzNkb2VAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68785,"nextInTopic":68790,"prevInTime":68785,"nextInTime":68787,"topicId":68771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ø  In these situations with children (mine and others), I have discovered a lot about myself and the children by asking what is the advantage to being ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-684999890\">Ø  In these situations with children (mine and others), I have discovered a<br/>\nlot about myself and the children by asking &quot;what is the advantage to being<br/>\nfirst?&quot; And then, &quot;what is the advantage to being last?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a great idea.

And sometimes &quot;the answer&quot; that comes is a politely worded surrender, and the older child, or pushier child, or quickest child &quot;wins&quot; again.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229711483,"authorName":"peanutyogi","from":"&quot;peanutyogi&quot; &lt;peanutyogi@...&gt;","profile":"peanutyogi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Me First!","postDate":"1345955336","msgId":68784,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsxYzhtOCszZG9lQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGsxOWpxdiszbTF2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68777,"nextInTopic":68785,"prevInTime":68783,"nextInTime":68785,"topicId":68771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Looks like an opportunity to explore last .

Second, it can move us toward &quot;svadyaya&quot; a yoga term for learning about self through looking inward, which can be a helpful tool in moving through challenging social situations.<br/>\nIf when the question is asked, the child(ren) is(are) stumped to find an advantage to &quot;last&quot;, I have offered why I might choose the last seat in the train - a better view, or an opportunity to learn from others experience thereby having more fun when it is my turn.  (I was the last child in an Italian catholic family, so I&#39;ve mastered being &quot;last&quot;.  I have a list of advantages a mile long if you want more.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, the gift comes in asking the child.<br/>\nWhen we ask instead of tell, the answer always comes.<br/>\n<br/>\njb<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;emstrength3&quot; &lt;emstrength@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I need suggestions about how to respond to my 6 year old and 4 year old who both often want to go first with whatever they are doing.
