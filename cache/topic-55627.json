It wasn&#39;t fair to those who are here to discuss  <br/>\nunschooling openly and honestly.  I was giving her the benefit of the  <br/>\ndoubt, thinking she would (as some people do) turn around and say  <br/>\n&quot;OH!  This is cool.&quot;   That did not happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was sent to one person (maybe several, but it doesn&#39;t matter now);<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-They won&#39;t put my posts on the group. I am only here to discover  <br/>\nways to meet the needs of children + hardly make money from my  <br/>\nwebsite. I wish I did. This is a passion of mine + that is why I do  <br/>\nit. All my contributions to this group have been discarded + have had  <br/>\nto email people individually to explain the misunderstandings +  <br/>\ngeneralisations made about me. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to her website she has already (all by herself, it seems)  <br/>\nidentified what children need.  (&quot;I have identified what children need  <br/>\nto be happy and successful.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is not true that ALL her contributions had been discarded. If  <br/>\nsomeone will tell one lie, all the rest of what they say becomes  <br/>\nsuspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she wanted to know more about unschooling, these sites were cited  <br/>\nmore than once in recent discussions:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo that wasn&#39;t true either.  It wasn&#39;t about learning or discovery.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is what I want to spotlight:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-. All my contributions to this group have been discarded + have had  <br/>\nto email people individually to explain the misunderstandings +  <br/>\ngeneralisations made about me. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;  + have had to email people individually &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did NOT &quot;have to&quot; email anyone.<br/>\nShe did not &quot;have to&quot; join the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to be courteous and welcome she would have had to follow the  <br/>\nguidelines of the list, and answer questions such as &quot;Are you an  <br/>\nunschooler?&quot;  But she didn&#39;t have to do that either.  And chose not  <br/>\nto.  But she chose to send individual e-mails to several members of  <br/>\nthe list.  Didn&#39;t have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone hopes to make any money or to have a reputation for being  <br/>\nknowledgeable, thoughtful and rational, it&#39;s good to practice those  <br/>\ntraits and to be scrupulously honest and forthcoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot knowing the difference between &quot;I had to&quot; and &quot;I chose to&quot; will  <br/>\nprevent any understanding of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\ncc: Claire Marketos</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55581,"nextTopicId":55604}}
