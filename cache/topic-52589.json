I like the clarity of Montessori and the beauty of Waldorf, and I do draw on those things in our unschooling life, but only as particular resources among many that I make available to my kids. I would never insist that they do a Waldorf felt project or a Montessori number bead activity, because I believe learning happens best through choice. Unschoolers can strew all sorts of resources, without forcing their kids to utilise any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, through unschooling you turn away from all the competing and contested theories out there, and turn towards your own children right here and now.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Vidyut Kale &lt;wide.aware@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; TJed is Thomas Jefferson something (education?).

In Waldorf education, they can&#39;t choose to read scary stories or color with black crayons. In some ways they couldn&#39;t be more different: Waldorf education focuses on imagination and delays formal academics, whereas I remember reading Maria Montessori saying that children should be discouraged from imaginative play until they were older and firmly grounded in reality.
