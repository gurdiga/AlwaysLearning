The idea of eating it turns my<br/>\nstomach, and I&#39;m literally nauseated by the smell of bananas. When I was<br/>\n8 my dad offered to pay me a quarter if I&#39;d eat a plum, and since I was<br/>\ndesperately saving for a Baby Alive doll I did, taking infinitesimally<br/>\nsmall bites so it took an hour and a half to do it. He told me later that<br/>\nhe regretted the offer after the first ten minutes - he had assumed that<br/>\nI&#39;d either say no, or say yes and take a bite and realize it wasn&#39;t so<br/>\nbad.<br/>\n<br/>\nRain won&#39;t eat any fruit either, except apples and lemons and limes,  and<br/>\nI did try to offer lots when she was little and she used to like grapes.<br/>\nAnd I know two other woman wh don&#39;t eat fruit, and who also have a<br/>\ndaughter who doesn&#39;t eat fruit, and they both say bananas are the worst.<br/>\nWhat is the worst fruit to your brother? On woman also has another<br/>\ndaughter who *does* eat fruit. I wonder if there&#39;s a sort of genetic<br/>\nsensitivity to fruit esters that we have, or a sensitivity to the enzymes<br/>\nthat make these esters. I do think that when kids repeatedly chose not to<br/>\neat something there&#39;s often an underlying biological reason for it, and<br/>\nthat if we eat what we feel like eating things work out better, generally<br/>\nspeaking - but food has gotten really complicated these days, with<br/>\nartificial stuff designed to fool the body.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] getting kids to taste something","postDate":"1079650446","msgId":19092,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwMzE4MjI1NDA2Ljg5MTE4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzAxLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNzk2MjE2MDMuNTI4Ljk1OTY4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":19069,"nextInTopic":19094,"prevInTime":19091,"nextInTime":19093,"topicId":19063,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...  ...
