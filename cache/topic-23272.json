I tried again to discuss directions with him, <br/>\nand I talked about history, with examples like when Kirby was little we didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a patio, and now we do, and when Marty was little we didn&#39;t have a door to <br/>\nthe patio, and now we do, and when the new baby comes those things will have <br/>\nbeen there his whole life.   He seemed to be getting the idea that the cowboys <br/>\nused to be in this same place, but it was a long time ago, and that before <br/>\nour house was built, it was the desert right where our house is, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis most interesting expression about the whole matter was “People who live <br/>\nin the East never get to see the sun go down.”<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I took him and Marty “to see the sun set out West in the desert.”  <br/>\n We drove out Friday after work to the other side of Bernalillo, where Keith <br/>\nknew of a dirt road that leads to Rio Rancho.   We drove off on an old <br/>\nleftover bit of highway, and off on this dirt road.   (We took some pictures, so <br/>\nthat&#39;ll be in the kids&#39; books.)   It was a little muddy, and they found good <br/>\nsticks (Yucca stalks) and we saw cactus and could find no animal tracks at all, <br/>\neven though the road and a little wash had been very well cleared out by the rain <br/>\nand were muddy (dry enough to walk on, mostly)..   We found a horse&#39;s jawbone <br/>\nwith teeth (which Keith scouted out and let Kirby “find” and pull out of the <br/>\nmud) but Kirby wasn&#39;t as impressed by that as he should&#39;ve been.   The sun <br/>\nwent down, and we came back.   Kirby fell asleep on the way home and he was <br/>\nsatisfied (for a while) about the west and the desert.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"an old riddle (not a good one)","postDate":"1130013718","msgId":23272,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExLjUwMmRlODAwLjMwOGJmZTE2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":23273,"prevInTime":23271,"nextInTime":23273,"topicId":23272,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tue, Jan 26, 1993 Kirby s riddle:   What has half the world seen but no one will ever see again?
