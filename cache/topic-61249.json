I think your sister <br/>\nis passive aggressively judging your parenting and blaming you for her lack of a <br/>\nrelationship with your son.  Maybe your parenting style is the cause of this, or <br/>\nmaybe it&#39;s not. Regardless, she doesn&#39;t really seem open to having a <br/>\nconversation about *why* you parent as you do or *how* to have a relationship <br/>\nwith your son; she simply wants you to make it happen, and that is asking you to <br/>\npotentially hurt your relationship with your son.  And, if your son is anything <br/>\nlike my daughter (5yo in June), no amount of pressure is going to make him want <br/>\nto be around her.  In fact, the pressure will likely push him further away from <br/>\nher. Maybe gently suggest to your sister that warmth begets warmth, and over <br/>\ntime Logan will warm to her if she is warm and welcoming to him.

I remember very clearly the first time that she <br/>\nfelt okay talking to a stranger.  We were out walking in our neighborhood, she <br/>\nwas about 6/7.  We went on walks a lot and I said hello to people that we&#39;d pass <br/>\nalong the way.  Sometimes neighbors say hello back or do more chit chat before <br/>\npassing on by.

Namely, there are huge cultural differences<br/>\nin the way people think of &quot;family&quot; and what that means. I come from a clan<br/>\nthat considers family ties to be very important. Failing to adhere to these<br/>\ncultural traditions would have meant more than just a casual disagreement<br/>\nbetween family members, it would have meant a serious split and would have<br/>\ncaused perhaps more pain than would be the case in a family that has a<br/>\ndifferent cultural overalay.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that really helped my kids (and me) was to teach the kids to do<br/>\ncertain things that made everybody happy; then the kids could retreat to<br/>\ntheir own comfort zone without catching flak. For instance, my kids were<br/>\ntaught to greet elders very politely, make appropriate small talk, then get<br/>\noutta Dodge.  &quot;Good morning, Aunt Mimi. I&#39;m so glad to see you again. Yes,<br/>\nI&#39;m learning a lot at home. No, I don&#39;t wish I could go to school, they<br/>\nwon&#39;t let me to calculus until I&#39;m a teenager. I hope your arthritis is<br/>\nbetter. Do you like the picture I drew for you?&quot; And then the kid would be<br/>\nout of there but the family could only remark about how well behaved he was.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this doesn&#39;t work for infants. When my kids were babies, I had to<br/>\nturn into Mama Bear: &quot;Mother (to my M-I-L), she is at a stage where she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t feel comfortable with anybody other than me and her dad. How about I<br/>\nhold her on my lap and you play patty cake?&quot;   Of course, this didn&#39;t keep<br/>\nthe same MIL from telling me that she didn&#39;t think of my kids as her &quot;real&quot;<br/>\ngrandkids because she never had an opportunity to give them a bottle and she<br/>\njust didn&#39;t get those funny fleece diapers I used ... but it also prevented<br/>\nall-out warfare, which was to nobody&#39;s advantage. I did have to tell her<br/>\nthat if she criticized my toddler for nursing, however, we would have to<br/>\nstay away until the kid was 5. She shut up, at least in our presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamily.

And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith everything from extended nursing to family bedding to homeschooling, I<br/>\ncaught flak from my extended family. One thing that seemed apparent was that<br/>\nthey sometimes felt that my choices were some kind of put-down on their<br/>\nchoices: &quot;I&#39;d breastfeed if I could, I know it&#39;s best for the baby, but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t have the luxury of staying at home with my kids all day.&quot; (Yeah, but<br/>\nyou also have two new cars, an expensive house in the &#39;burbs and your kids<br/>\nwear Nikes. We have one car, an older home, my kids wear homemade and garage<br/>\nsale clothes, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helped was when I stopped defending my parenting choices and simply<br/>\nreplied that we all love our kids, we all do our best, and each family&#39;s<br/>\nchoices will naturally be different. Vive la difference!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that worked for us was for me to invite their kids to my home. The<br/>\nkids had a good time, the cousins bonded, and we got to enjoy each other.<br/>\nMeeting at the zoo, the museum, etc. was also good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was even better was taking every opportunity to celebrate our<br/>\nfamily-ness. Phone calls to Auntie from my kids, being cousin pen-pals,<br/>\nmaking sure to share as much of our kids&#39; lives as possible with the<br/>\nextended family, helped smooth over some of those rough edges.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: You don&#39;t get to choose your blood kin but it&#39;s a great lesson<br/>\nto impart to our children, that we love people for who they are even if we<br/>\nhave differences; people are to be cherished; and blood is thicker than<br/>\nwater.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn peace,<br/>\nCamille<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: help with family/sister","postDate":"1306309660","msgId":61251,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlyaWM2cys5ajE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlyaGEzMSttMHYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61250,"nextInTopic":61252,"prevInTime":61250,"nextInTime":61252,"topicId":61249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===Last time Logan and I were on our way there, (they live an hour a way), he said he thought that Alison, my sister is mean to Olivia, my neice, whom he","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1743002738\">===Last time Logan and I were on our way there, (they live an hour a way), he said he thought that Alison, my sister is mean to Olivia, my neice, whom he adores. He said he does not like Alison, I have certainly not ecnouraged that.===<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t feel compelled to press him to spend time with someone he has flat-out said he doesn&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, since he enjoys spending time with his cousin, perhaps you could suggest to your sister that you two and your kids meet at a park or other outdoorsy place (neutral territory) on a regular basis -- someplace where it&#39;s okay to run and be loud!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe he will begin to be more comfortable with her if the time being spent around her is someplace where the kids can spread their wings, and where she&#39;s less inclined to clip those wings ;-).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my son was that age, he preferred to be with me or his dad. My son and I did, however, meet up with my two sisters-in-law and their kids on a weekly basis (sometimes twice a week) at someplace or another away from our houses (parks, indoor play areas, etc.). My son was shy around his aunts and would come to me when he needed help or wanted me to join in his play, but if I&#39;d stepped away or was doing something with one of his cousins then one of his aunts would offer to help or to push him on the swings or to play with him until I was available. They were gentle with him and not pushy, and that helped him become comfortable with them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt 12, he still comes to me first if we&#39;re all gathered together, but he does trust his aunts (and uncles) and knows they will help out if I&#39;m not available. (Although he&#39;s much more inclined to go to the aunt and uncle who are kinder and gentler in their tones of voice than to the aunt and uncle who raise their voices and are more disrespectful in how they talk to their own kids.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do choose for your son and you to spend more time around your sister, I would be honest with her and tell her that loud and aggressive voices scare him, whether those voices are directed at him or someone else, and if she wants him to become more comfortable around her then it would help if she would use a softer and gentler tone of voice when he&#39;s around. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve found that people who make a habit of yelling or talking loudly aren&#39;t always aware that those tones of voice create a feeling of &quot;not safe&quot; to some people (my son, for example!); maybe your sister isn&#39;t aware of that either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree strongly with your sister&#39;s comment that you shouldn&#39;t be the center of your son&#39;s universe -- at 4.5, you absolutely SHOULD be the center of his universe!! Nor would I accept the guilt it seems she&#39;s trying to lay at your feet about her not being a bigger part of your son&#39;s life. It&#39;s your job to protect your son, and if he tells you he doesn&#39;t like being around her, what she wants is far less important than him feeling safe. You can offer her options with which you and your son are comfortable, and she can make an effort to interact with / around him in a way that helps him feel more comfortable around her, but your obligation is to your son not your sister!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202672836,"authorName":"Milena","from":"&quot;Milena&quot; &lt;milena177@...&gt;","profile":"milena177@sbcglobal.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: help with family/sister","postDate":"1306303063","msgId":61252,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlyaTVvbitnMTIwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlyaGEzMSttMHYxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61251,"nextInTopic":61253,"prevInTime":61251,"nextInTime":61253,"topicId":61249,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Meryl, This is tough and I am so new to this philosophy of unschooling so I could be completly off by what I am about to say and would LOVE clarification to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-410223786\">Hi Meryl,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is tough and I am so new to this philosophy of unschooling so I could be completly off by what I am about to say and would LOVE clarification to make more sense of this philosophy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt definately feels like your sister is sad about not being able to relate to Logan because of the differing life styles.  How opposed are you to offering her suggestions on how she could have more of a relationship with Logan. Would it be too forward to say that Logan is just not used to the yelling and so on?
