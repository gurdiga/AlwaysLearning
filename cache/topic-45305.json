I  <br/>\nwaited tables for about 10 years, and while I was doing that, I had  <br/>\nanxiety dreams at least a couple times a week. Like, the whole  <br/>\nrestaurant was my &quot;section&quot; and it was packed, or I couldnt get the  <br/>\nfood out of the kitchen or the computer was jammed and wouldnt take  <br/>\nmy orders.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven tho its been 7 years since I waitressed or bartended, I still  <br/>\nhave these dreams fairly often. Couple times a month at least. I had  <br/>\none last night, as a matter of fact!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its obvious, but I found waiting tables to be stressful. I also  <br/>\nhad a lot of fun and quite often really enjoyed it, especially when I  <br/>\nworked with a lot of fun people. I dont know if the dreams I have  <br/>\nabout it now are leftover memories/worries about that time, or if any  <br/>\nof the stress/worries I have *now* just manifest as waitress work!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think probably the former, because I really dont have major  <br/>\nconcerns or stress right now. Now that I think about it, that time of  <br/>\nmy life, stress and anxiety werent just from work. My whole life was  <br/>\na mess.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy<br/>\nmom to zibby 5 years and henry 20 months<br/>\n<br/>\n*****<br/>\nblogging at:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net\">http://happychildhood.homeschooljournal.net</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45293,"nextTopicId":45279}}
