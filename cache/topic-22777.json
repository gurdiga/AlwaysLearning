I also find my children&#39;s choices hampered by impositions of petty rules imposed by the state.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if my children want to gain qualifications for tertiary study they must either go to school or we must fund them to use a correspondence course at a price 10 times higher than that charged to persons above compulsory age or in schools which can&#39;t provide the subjects.  To what extent do others feel a need to enter into dialogue with the state and political parties either to gain incremental improvements or to lobby for the removal of compulsion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend toward trying to gain the incremental improvements in the short term but I am not sure if I have the courage time or ability to lobby for the really major changes - removal of compulsion - which I feelis needed before families can have true choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterested in how others have taking this moving from the personal to the political.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nJulie W<br/>\nWellington<br/>\nNew Zealand   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22758,"nextTopicId":22779}}
