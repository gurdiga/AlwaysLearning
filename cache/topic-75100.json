They are at an age when they are experimenting with what you","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1928560179\">It is developmentally completely normal for 3 year olds (and 4 year olds, and 5 year olds) to lie. They are at an age when they are experimenting with what you know and what they know, and whether you know what they know. This is probably particularly important for her, since you were not around when all these things were happening to her so she has very little idea what you really might know. Lying at this age is not something you have to &#39;do&#39; anything about for most children, they grow out of it when in a supportive environment.  So I would see it as normal experimentation, rather than as meaning that there is something wrong with her, whether it be due to genetics or environment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, she has had a really difficult start to life and as such the lying might have more significance than it would for another child. I would pay attention to it, but not in a &#39;how can I change this&#39; way but more as an insight into how she is processing her experiences and what her fears might be right now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like her physical and medical needs have had priority in her life up to now and that her emotional needs may not have received as much attention.  It is possible that as she feels more secure with you her emotional needs will become more obvious - meaning that her behaviour may become more challenging.  Again, focusing on connection and attachment will be important in helping you all manage the repercussions of what happened to her when she was tiny. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not clear from your post what the &#39;chronic lying&#39; is about on a daily basis. Apart from saying the foster mother hurt her, what is she lying about? Are there themes you can identify - e.g is she hiding things from you - might she be afraid you will take things away? Is she lying about her behaviour - might she be fearful you will send her back to hospital if she is &#39;bad&#39;?  Is she trying to make sense of what happened to her - medical treatment to young children may well feel like someone is hurting them deliberately?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible to reflect back without confirming what she says - you could say something like &#39;it felt like your foster mother hurt you when your leg was hurting&#39;.  I would ask yourself in each moment  how you can connect to her experience and build a relationship with her, rather than what you can do about her lying. <br/>\n<br/>\nNaomi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":404384677,"authorName":"","from":"jthomsonquazi@...","profile":"jenniferthom70","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: lying","postDate":"1417057287","msgId":75112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG01NjQ2NysxM2hmZjMzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG01M2pobCsxb3RxMzVuQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG01M2pobCsxb3RxMzVuQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75111,"nextInTopic":75113,"prevInTime":75111,"nextInTime":75113,"topicId":75100,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello jencookies43, I m so moved by your daughter s story.

Nurtureshock is not on its face an unschooling book, but it is not inconsistent with unschooling, particularly in that its primary focus is fact-based responses to &quot;common knowledge,&quot; and it turns a lot of &quot;common knowledge&quot; on its head. It also helps get your head around what to do with new information. Kinda like this list! :)</div><div><br></div><div>One of the things that they point out in their analysis is that little kids are literalists, and thus are deeply influenced/affected by all the semi-truths and white lies that swirl around them. In the medicalized and chaotic world your little girl is coming from, her feelings that the world has not been honest with her could be profound, and she could be reflecting this. One example from the book was an almost-6-year-old child who got very angry with his/her (can&#39;t remember which) mother for saying something about him being 6 (in reference to what type of game someone else should bring, the mother said &quot;oh, something age-appropriate for a 6-year-old, or something like that). The mother wasn&#39;t even thinking about it, and certainly wasn&#39;t lying, per se, but the kid called her out because, really, it wasn&#39;t true that the child was 6. If your little girl has spent her life fielding half-truths and un-truths (this won&#39;t hurt, this will only hurt for a minute, you&#39;re safe here, etc. etc.), she may be trying to process now what&#39;s the difference between truth and lies, where&#39;s the line, what is reality. Does that make sense? </div><div><br></div><div>Also, her need for attention and affirmation is probably profound (my own kids have talked about injuries that they never had, or that were nowhere near as injurious as they would have others believe, and I believe that stems from a desire for connection to the person they&#39;re talking to -- Hey! I had that same injury! -- and/or a desire for attention -- Hey! I was wounded! Comfort me! -- and they haven&#39;t seen nearly the trauma that your little girl has. Her need for affirmation and comfort and love is probably heartbreakingly deep. </div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I would read that. They give a lot of good advice about how to address your own language around truth and lying, and how to address it when you see/hear it in your kid. Also a lot of comforting information about why kids lie, and when they lie, and what it says about their development. There is a lot about what your little girl is doing that is completely normal/common/healthy, despite the unique (or, sadly, not unique enough) experiences she has had, and they have good advice for how to address it so as to emphasize that you value truth-telling. And we need to be much more aware of how much adults tend to lie to and around children, and cut it out if we want them to be honest with us. As with all values, you have to live it if you want your kids to believe that you value it. </div><div><br></div><div>Strength, </div><div>Kimberley </div><div><br></div>-- <br><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1616820516gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;border-collapse:collapse;line-height:15px;\">“It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate<br>between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the<br>vital connection between them.”<br>-- Leo F.

She&#39;s been in the hospital much of her life then with a foster mom who is an rn before she was put in placement with our family. She was with an rn as she is still medically fragile (soft remission from a very aggressive childhood cancer).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like some advice on how to respond to her chronic lying. She had invetro drug exposure,  massive chemotherapy and radiation, and I can only guess what life was like for her living in the hospital with no mommy and then a very rigid foster mom. I&#39;m guessing her lying is related to transition or possibly organic in nature from all the legal and illegal drugs in her life or even hereditary.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe does seem to have memory issues and trouble retaining simple things like nursery rhymes,  number sequences and accusing people of hurting her. She said the foster mom was mean and broke her leg and she needed a cast. The actual truth is that she needed surgery and the hospital casted her leg. Many other lies that daily and just don&#39;t make sense (at least to me).<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s young and has experienced so much trama in her lititle life so I expect her to cope with her new, hopefully happy, life with our family and show issues from past tramas. She has been with us for 3 months and I am just being her loving mommy friend so hopefully she will one day trust me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meanwhile.... knowing what you now know,  how would you deal with the lying?  I&#39;m thinking redirecting but how do I do that and should I address the lies or ignore them for now and see how that works?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75115,"nextTopicId":75117}}
