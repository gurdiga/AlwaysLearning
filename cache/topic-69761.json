I WANT to, desperately....but perhaps I am not cut out for it. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand that. I wanted to have four children. I planned on wooing Graham (who only wanted two) with my amazing parenting skills to help change his mind. The wooing didn&#39;t get very far. I wasn&#39;t as amazing as I thought I was going to be in my pre-children fantasy life  ;-) I flat out ran out of energy. Maybe it was because I waited until I was older to have children, or because Gisele had health issues, or because I didn&#39;t realize how physically and emotionally exhausting parenting was going to be for me, or perhaps it was a combination of all those reasons. But I realized I was probably not cut out for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand that you&#39;re feeling uncertain about unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about this?:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Is there anything I can do to mend this relationship before it&#39;s too late? Please help... -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the advice and ideas you&#39;ve been getting are based on the philosophy of unschooling, it is also the best relationship mending advice I know of. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it would help you right now not to think so much about the unschooling right now, but to focus more on how to mend your relationship with your sweet little boy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was in your situation, I would do some grand gesture to reconnect with my little boy. I would apologize and tell him I was going to try to do better and listen better. I would recognize that he is not getting his fill of mama time and connection. I would be aware that with the new baby coming, his feeling of lack is only likely to increase. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, I would probably plan a fun weekend away - just me and my little boy. I would make sure my husband and daughter were well taken care of and also set up to have an amazing weekend together and then I would focus all my energy on connecting with my son. Maybe I would take him to a hotel with a fun swimming pool and make sure our room was well stocked with lots of bowls filled with different candies and cookies. I&#39;d make sure the ipad was full of new games. I&#39;d take water guns into the pool and have a shoot out with him. We&#39;d order pizzas, watch movies and cartoons, I&#39;d tell him funny stories about what he was like as a baby, I&#39;d attentively listen to his stories, and I&#39;d pay close attention to how he was feeling. I would deliberately do everything I could to increase his feelings of connection, happiness, safety, and wellbeing. We&#39;d talk in bed until we both fell asleep exhausted from all the fun we had. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also come up with a special signal that he could use when he&#39;s feeling unheard, bored, lost, confused, and/or lonely. Maybe it would be a soft squeeze of my hand, or a made up word, or a special talisman. When he used that signal in the future, it would trigger me to stop what I was doing that was hurting him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually did use this when Gianluca and Gisele were younger and it worked wonderfully. I gave them a wooden love stone, engraved with the message &#39;I love you&#39; in multiple languages. It was their magic talisman that gave them the power to help me be nicer and to help me focus on what&#39;s important - them! It&#39;s a very powerful tool for young children. What was required of me to keep it powerful was that I let it work every single time, no matter how busy/tired/upset/frustrated/irritated/depressed I was. If I had failed even once, it would have lost it&#39;s magic. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of them gave me the love stone, I would change the energy of the situation by breathing deeply, filling my heart with my love for my child, making eye contact with them, smiling, touching them, and thanking them for reminding me to be nicer (all this probably took 30 seconds). I would pay attention to what they were saying and do my honest best to say  &#39;yes, let&#39;s do that&#39; (or some form of yes). Often I wouldn&#39;t be able to stop everything right then, but I&#39;d keep them close and talk with them as I was finishing up what I was in the middle of. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe best advice I can give you is to keep reading here - even in little bits and pieces. It will help you expand your mind and see new possibilities. It will help soften you and be sweeter to all your children and your husband. Even if you decide not to continue with unschooling, reading here will help you have stronger relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if you start doing what is suggested for mending your relationship, you&#39;re already moving dangerously close towards unschooling ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRippy<br/>\n(Gianluca 8, Gisele 6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":479109089,"authorName":"Jen","from":"&quot;Jen&quot; &lt;jenyoust@...&gt;","profile":"boo_boo_flower","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355400861","msgId":69794,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGthY2dxdCtoNHNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwOTE1MDk0LUUzMkQtNDZBMy1BQkI2LTYxNzdCQzgzMjRCREB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69792,"nextInTopic":69796,"prevInTime":69793,"nextInTime":69795,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-300864211\">&lt;&lt;&lt;You don&#39;t have to.

In my mind, I have to in order to make this work.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;When people are training dogs to be mean, they sometimes keep them hungry<br/>\nbetween trainins sessions. Two dobermans nearly killed a boy whose family I<br/>\nknew. They had been tied up for two days without food or water, and their<br/>\ntrain-to-be-mean owner was away from the house. Had those dogs had food and<br/>\nwater anytime they wanted it they would have been &quot;spoiled.&quot; They would have<br/>\nbeen content. They wouldn&#39;t have gotten loose and attacked, eaten part of and<br/>\nthen buried a seven year old boy. It was out in the counry in northern New<br/>\nMexico, in Medanales. An elderly neighbor saw the frenzy and the dogs burrying<br/>\nsomething. He thought it was a pig they had snatched.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand this is an analogy; however, I do not completely deprive my son of the things he wants/needs  I do give him what he wants/asks for most of the time.  But, I am starting to understand that being wishy-washy about &quot;sometimes&quot; is what is causing issues for us.  The Coke machine analogy was very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;And his choices might be wanting attention and contact. <br/>\nThat should be expected. He&#39;s a young mammal. Mammals live in dens, and sleep<br/>\ntouching. A mother fox doesn&#39;t dig four or five little holes and put a a<br/>\nkitfox in each one at night. They stay with their mom until they venture out<br/>\non their own.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to say that my son does NOT enjoy physical contact.  I try this often with him...try to cuddle (or ask him if I feel he really doesn&#39;t want it, but I do offer).  Touch is something he doesn&#39;t enjoy unless it&#39;s rough play.  Daddy offers this every day, but I can only play so rough at 32 weeks pregnant right now.  For instance, during a movie or show, he&#39;d rather sit at the end of the couch on his own while his sissy wants to snuggle up right next to someone  they are different.  I fall asleep with him when he asks me to (co-sleeping is something we aren&#39;t doing as my husband gets up around 5am for a medical job, is a light sleeper and needs adequate sleep for his job), but he does not want me to hold him in bed.  He just wants me to lie next to him, and I do not say no to these requests.  I do respect his boundaries, so I suppose people&#39;s suggestions to be sweet, give him lots of love/attention means doing what he enjoys (and touch is not one of them at this time).  Being present and playing are probably the best things I could give him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;What&#39; below might seem harsh, but it&#39;s not as harsh as what you first wrote<br/>\nabout your son. At the end are links that have helped many other people, and<br/>\nhave the experiences of many people. Please do read a little, try a little,<br/>\nwait a while and watch.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was harsh what I wrote about my son.  Part of being vulnerable and open to suggestion is telling it like it is.  I believe there was no other way to ask for advice unless I was completely honest.  I am very glad that I did because this advice is helping me understand the issues I&#39;ve caused by being stuck in between conventional parenting and living a more joyful life with my family.  Stuck is the best word  it is amazing how hard it is to come out of old ways of thinking after 1.) being raised that way, 2.) living around other &quot;conventional&quot; people in your neighborhood and 3.) too often caring what other people think.  If I can&#39;t be honest with myself (and this list), I would still be stuck.  I can feel myself becoming unstuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Really? SHOULD be done? Deschooling doesn&#39;t apply to a four year old. His<br/>\nacademic learning hadn&#39;t even begun.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I read this, perhaps I meant my own deschooling, not his.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;You don&#39;t have time to read that, and it&#39;s not sufficiently helpful for its<br/>\nlength. Here&#39;s what to take from it: You&#39;ll have three babies. Keep them, all<br/>\nof them, as near as they want to be, as much as you can manage to do that. Let<br/>\nthem see what you do--folding clothes, making food, cleaning up. You might not<br/>\nget to do much more than that for a long time.  You don&#39;t get time to yourself for a few years.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand this concept (that I will not have &quot;me-time&quot; for many more years.  I am ok with that...I wrote a blog posting about that recently...about giving up that time I &quot;thought&quot; I needed  giving up that notion was part of my deschooling process. I am surrounded my moms in my life that cherish their me-time, so this is one of the last things I have learned to change.   They do see what I do during the day (fold clothes, making food, cleaning up, etc.), and they do enjoy being around me when I am happily getting things done.  Where the disconnect happens is when I getting tired, hungry, frustrated with myself for whatever reason, and then a request comes that &quot;pushes me over the edge&quot;.  It&#39;s not their fault.  It&#39;s mine.  I appreciate the summary of The Continuum Concept; however, I will still read it, and it will take me months...as I love reading and learning, and I do try to fit it in in increments here and there.  It&#39;s not something I&#39;m attempting to swallow in a few days. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I do. You have unrealistic expectations and a harshness toward him.<br/>\nYou seem to be giving up because parenting is getting a little challenging. <br/>\nYou&#39;re tired, and angry, and frustrated. He&#39;s probably reacting to that in<br/>\nvery natural, human ways. And if he&#39;s genetically like you, one of you needs<br/>\nto stop that feedback loop. Be his partner. Take a gracious loss for the team,<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s too young to do that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nRight on.  I do give up easily.  And I know, at least with this, that I don&#39;t want to.  And yes, he is a lot like me.  I liked &quot;things&quot; when I was little, and I don&#39;t even know why.  It wasn&#39;t because my mom didn&#39;t give me attention (she actually gave me too much), but I liked my STUFF a lot...I organized it, took care of it, etc.  That alone should help me understand...<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;This is a lot to put out at once, but things have gotten dangerous at your<br/>\nhouse, and children can&#39;t learn in a dangerous atmosphere.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why, but this comment sat with me all day and night and sort of frightened me.  Things are dangerous at my house?  We have a lot of good moments...and love...but yes, also a lot of frustration, crankiness and unhappiness at times.  But, hearing this scares me.  I didn&#39;t realize things had gotten dangerous.  I guess I don&#39;t understand the context in which the word is being used...perhaps I am being too literal.  I suppose if it means that we are at danger of giving up unschooling/attachment parenting principles for a more familiar way of life, than yes...it is dangerous.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":327452883,"authorName":"marie_vijendran","from":"&quot;marie_vijendran&quot; &lt;vijendranmarie@...&gt;","profile":"marie_vijendran","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355381686","msgId":69792,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGthYnUzbSsycTdyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGthOXFtYSs2YzBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69790,"nextInTopic":69794,"prevInTime":69791,"nextInTime":69793,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Jen, ...

It helps parents reconnect/connect at a deeper level one-on-one with their children. It can help heal things that we did differently when they were little when we didn&#39;t have the awareness we do now. It helps heal us as parents as much as the child. To put everything else in the world aside from your relationship with your child for a whole weekend is incredible.

And, he asks for very little.  Just for example, it was his birthday in November.  He got some gifts.  Nice things he had been hoping for.  For Christmas, I asked him what he would like.

When your son calls for your attention, don&#39;t fill it with material things to subdue his needs.  Fill him full of you.  He will still want stuff.

Stuff he plays with<br/>\n&gt; for an hour and then never touches again. Where should the limit be?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>My daughter has also always liked to have a lot of stuff. She likes to try <br/>\nthings for herself, and her ipad is nearly out of space because of all the <br/>\ngames she has (and she deletes any she doesn&#39;t like frequently). We&#39;ve found <br/>\nways for her to be able to have lots of apps, and it not to break the bank. <br/>\nFirstly, I let her download any free app she likes. She knows how to find <br/>\nfree ones, and we have apps like &#39;app miner&#39; where you can specifically <br/>\nsearch for free or on sale apps. You can put in an app you like, and it will <br/>\nnotify you when it goes on sale/free.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also use itunes cards instead of having our credit card on file. It helps <br/>\nus budget, and when the card is spent, there is no more left. My daughter <br/>\n(who&#39;s 8 now), will often still want me to check if there is enough money in <br/>\nthere to buy an app, and I will put in my password, even though I know there <br/>\nisn&#39;t. She understands that when the money is gone, there isn&#39;t any more <br/>\nuntil our next payday. It also means that friends and family can buy her <br/>\nitunes cards for her birthday/Christmas/random gifts. She loves that, and to <br/>\nour surprise, these days she will often encourage my husband or I to buy <br/>\nsomething with her itunes money.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis hasn&#39;t happened overnight. It&#39;s taken several years for her to feel <br/>\nlike she has enough to be able to share. And we still have a long way to go. <br/>\nBut every time I take some advice here and change my perspective, say yes <br/>\nmore, or find a way to do something I thought we couldn&#39;t manage, it gets <br/>\nbetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; * He wants to play games with us as a family, but can NOT stand to lose. <br/>\n&gt; On days that we don&#39;t want to deal with a<br/>\n&gt; melt down, we try to help him win. On days we are stronger, we try to play <br/>\n&gt; right and talk to him throughout the crying<br/>\n&gt; and playing that winning isn&#39;t the object...being together as a family and <br/>\n&gt; playing together is what matters...that not<br/>\n&gt; everyone can win all the time. You know, real life stuff. He can&#39;t STAND <br/>\n&gt; losing in any capacity. He wants to play the<br/>\n&gt; game (requests to even!), but he doesn&#39;t want to lose...even if he&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; behind in the game with still a chance of winning,<br/>\n&gt; he&#39;s miserable). If he&#39;s playing catch with daddy and drops the football, <br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s a tragedy and then he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; play anymore. So, he goes and does something easy or plays iPad by <br/>\n&gt; himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It was a big relief when I read (I think it was on this list?), that it was <br/>\nOK to let my daughter win. Every time. I felt like I needed to teach her <br/>\nthat she only got to win sometimes, that it was a life lesson she needed to <br/>\nlearn. At 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt felt much better to me to let her win. When we played cards, my husband <br/>\nand I would not win rounds, would hold back cards, and would give her <br/>\nadvantages, let her pick a new card, or roll the dice again. It was fun, for <br/>\nall of us. And sometimes it is more challenging to lose than to win! Then, <br/>\nafter a year or two, my daughter started insisting that we had to take turns <br/>\nwinning. That everyone had to have a chance to win.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, sometimes we let her win, and sometimes we play properly. She knows <br/>\nwe&#39;re letting her win, and sometimes she will specifically ask to win <br/>\n(especially when she&#39;s learning a new game). But I have no worries that <br/>\nshe&#39;s going to grow up expecting to win every time. When she&#39;s playing with <br/>\nkids her own age, she has no problems with not winning.<br/>\n<br/>\nTamara</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355362255","msgId":69788,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyRTM1NUZFLTBFMTItNEYwRi1BNDEwLUU2MUIwNzFDRjk4QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGthYjgxOSt1NjNtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGthYjgxOSt1NjNtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69787,"nextInTopic":69789,"prevInTime":69787,"nextInTime":69789,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I can t say he s 100% on board.

There are people here who could vouch for my kids&#39; generosity of spirit and wallet.  We didn&#39;t give them everything they wanted, but we withhold things arbitrarily, nor ever say &quot;no&quot; just because we believed (or had a vague old voice in our heads) that &quot;no&quot; would guarantee that they would be....  what?  &quot;Unspoiled&quot;?  What would that be?  That they would be needy enough to do tricks for rewards?    I think that&#39;s really what&#39;s behind &quot;don&#39;t spoil them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people are training dogs to be mean, they sometimes keep them hungry between trainins sessions.  Two dobermans nearly killed a boy whose family I knew.  They had been tied up for two days without food or water, and their train-to-be-mean owner was away from the house.  Had those dogs had food and water anytime they wanted it they would have been &quot;spoiled.&quot;  They would have been content.  They wouldn&#39;t have gotten loose and attacked, eaten part of and then buried a seven year old boy.  It was out in the counry in northern New Mexico, in Medanales.  An elderly neighbor saw the frenzy and the dogs burrying something.  He thought it was a pig they had snatched.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can&#39;t undo what they do to their children.  Don&#39;t be harsh with them.  Don&#39;t create false desperation and real resentment when you could have trusting, loving relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we want our children to do something (now they&#39;re young adults, and we still sometimes ask them to to do things, or amend behaviors), we reason with them.  We don&#39;t threaten or reward.  We give the best information we have, and they either agree or counter with information we didn&#39;t have.  We treat them, as we always have, as respected members of our family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere you&#39;ve used another loaded, quoted phrase:  &quot;we want to have values other than being consumers in society, and these morals/values are very important to us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAre those &quot;morals&quot; more important that your child?   &quot;Comsumers in society&quot; is a sinful thing?  But you own an iPad, and a computer.

I used to feel the same way as a child.  Perhaps this is a place for me to start feeling good about something.  My son is the same way  he doesn&#39;t fall asleep easily at night, and I do still sometimes crave that time to myself.  Just time when little people aren&#39;t crawling on me, pulling me around, wrestling me...LOL.  But, I do see your point.  We don&#39;t co-sleep, but I do make myself very available to my kids when and if they need me at night.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;One thing that helps us when our kids ask about making a purchase is to think<br/>\nabout why we work.Â  We work to get money.Â&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the issue is, my husband a.) makes plenty of money, and b.) my husband grew up with nothing.  He had this firm belief that if you are given everything on a silver platter, you will never learn to appreciate anything...that a person must work to get what he wants in life (probably the seed for many of our problems transcending into this lifestyle!)  I grew up with plenty, and I believe there is some validity to his concerns.  It is very hard not to spoil your children when you have an abundant amount of money.  I think our problem is in knowing we have enough and knowing how easy it would be to go WAY OVERBOARD with any kind of purchasing for our children.  They COULD be utterly spoiled...but we choose not to live beyond our means..we want to have values other than being consumers in society, and these morals/values are very important to us.  I suppose when it comes to things like iPad apps, I should stop being so stingy...it&#39;s not the amount of money in our house as much as it is the &quot;principle&quot; of getting anything and everything you want, whenever you want it  something that is our problem (me and my husband), not our kids&#39;...it&#39;s something I HAVE to work on and change my mindset about.  I realize that now.When you go from structure to unschooling it can seem as if you go from having a<br/>\nreasonably well behaved child to having a demanding monster, where the more he<br/>\ngets the more he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;When you go from structure to unschooling it can seem as if you go from having a<br/>\nreasonably well behaved child to having a demanding monster, where the more he<br/>\ngets the more he wants.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYES, exactly!  I think knowing that changing MY mindset, MY approach and MY behaviors is what needs to happen here.  It is easy to feel like a martyr, it seems, at the beginning, but perhaps it is just a change in how I approach everyday life.  I like the idea of my kids joining me in adult activities (everyday chores, cleaning up, etc...or just following me from room to room when I do have to tend to &quot;lifey&quot; things.  Actually, recently I have tried this, and they enjoy being around me while I do other things...as long as I help them when they need help, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Is your husband completely on board with attachment parenting and unschooling?<br/>\nIf not I suspect it will be very difficult. If you have three small children AND<br/>\na husband feeling like he&#39;s not getting a look in you are in danger of feeling<br/>\neven more hard done by. If you feel you are doing it all it will be even harder.<br/>\nIf you feel you cannot tell him how exhausted you are for fear of being<br/>\ncriticised for bringing it on yourself it will be even harder. With three very<br/>\nyoung children you will need to be a good team.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say he&#39;s 100% on board.  But, to his credit...neither have I been.  I have WANTED to be for so long, but like someone already said, WANTING it isn&#39;t enough.  I need to just DO it.  And stop being self-absorbed and worried and whatever you want to call it.  It is true, if I don&#39;t change, none of this will.  It needs to start with me...he is generally one to follow suit once I am on board with something.  I do have his support with unschooling...but the attachment/non-punitive parenting is something he does struggle with.  I think we haven&#39;t gone with anything long enough to see what works for us.

If you want your son to persevere through the hard bits in life, he needs to see you doing so.  If you want him to do so with some grace, you too need to model grace and patience in difficult times.  And, you *can* choose to do it.  It is a choice.  It&#39;s not easy.  You&#39;ll fail sometimes.  Probably more times than not, at first.  But it is doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son used to whine.  One day I said to him, &quot;Can you pleeeease stoooop your whiiiining!&quot;  It was like I was in this BIG cave, and that whiney request of mine bounced right back at me, over and over and over :-)  He looked up at me.  Slowly, a smile crossed my face.  I asked him, &quot;Did you hear what I just did?&quot;  He shook his head, a little apprehensively.  &quot;I just asked you not to whine in a whiney voice!  How silly is that?&quot;  He paused for a second.  I could tell he was thinking about that.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;*I&#39;m* going try to stop whining!&quot;  He smiled and we continued on with whatever we were doing.  Once I stopped whining, he stopped whining.  Listen to yourself.  How do you talk to him, especially in your frustrated moments?  Once you hear the whine, demands, rudeness, etc (whatever it is, and we all have something) in your own voice, it&#39;s becomes less difficult to change.  Again, it just takes patience (with yourself) and perseverance.  Making better choices each time you speak.  It gets easier.  It fuels confidence too - confidence that you can make good choices and be the kind of person you hope you children will look to for examples of how to live in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, here&#39;s a little story about how I finally let go of that need for &quot;me time.&quot;  (In no way am I saying I became a martyr.  I still took time to do the things I wanted to do, but, like Meredith, I learned to fit in many of my interests and activities wherever time and opportunity allowed.  I became very creative about it too!)  Anyway, my son always wanted someone to be with him at night, until he was about 7 or so.  Now he&#39;s ten, and still likes company from time to time, especially if he&#39;s growing in some way.  In those early years, I wanted him to fall asleep fast so that I could get on with the &quot;me time.&quot;  Well, Ethan likes to talk before he goes to sleep.  Sometimes he likes to wrestle or tickle.  Sometimes he likes to read.  He used to like music.  Not so much any more.  Sometimes he just wants to nuzzle in and think.  He doesn&#39;t just lay down and go to sleep.  I would get so frustrated with that.  One night I was laying with him.  I was thinking about when I was a girl, and how much I wished someone would have been with me at night.  It just wasn&#39;t my parents&#39; way.  Bedtime was bedtime.  Their time was their time.  So, as I nuzzled in with Ethan, I imagined I was him being held at night like *I* had always longed for.  My goodness, what a wonderful feeling came over me.  It was like a warm, wonderful light went on.  All of a sudden I realized just how important my presence was to him.  And, there was bonus!

This is what it seemed like for me. But the more I understood and truly lived unschooling the more I got where I was wrong. If a child is only allowed a snack at 11am, or after tidy-up or whatever then anytime he asks he will be reminded it&#39;s not the right time and he will get pretty used to the idea. If however he can have a snack not just at a fixed time like 11am or after tidy-up or whatever then he will ask whenever he wants one. If sometimes his request is met with &quot;of course sweetie, what would you like? and sometimes with &quot;just a minute can&#39;t you see I&#39;m just loading the washing machine&quot; or &quot;not again, I just got you something ten minutes ago&quot; THAT system is not so easy to figure out at all. And he is expected to have vastly more skills than the child who is simply told that it&#39;s not the right time. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs your husband completely on board with attachment parenting and unschooling? If not I suspect it will be very difficult. If you have three small children AND a husband feeling like he&#39;s not getting a look in you are in danger of feeling even more hard done by. If you feel you are doing it all it will be even harder. If you feel you cannot tell him how exhausted you are for fear of being criticised for bringing it on yourself it will be even harder.  With three very young children you will need to be a good team. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband IS on board, do you co-sleep as a family? This was the best single thing (though there were thousands of other things too) I did to repair the connection with my own children (5 and 2 at the time). We spent a lot of time in bed - sleeping, reading, listening, pillow-fighting etc. And we spent a lot of time at home, where in amongst the constant domestic chaos there was plenty of opportunity for connecting cuddles and doing stuff together (anything - mundane everyday things).<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son is only four. He may be the eldest of three to you but I think you&#39;ll have very different expectations of four year olds when your youngest is four.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlison<br/>\nDS1(10) and DS2(7)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Jen&quot; &lt;jenyoust@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I am at a standstill about how to go about communicating and &quot;being&quot; with my 4-year old son.  I also have a 2 year old daughter and am pregnant with #3 (due in Jan.)  I am tired and frustrated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What I thought was a phase has proven to be more of a temperament thing.  My son, through no fault of his own due to my changes in parenting throughout this last year, is whiny, lost, bored and confused.  We used to have more structure in our home (when he was going to preschool 3x a week).  Since I&#39;ve let up on structure, added in fun things to do, given him free access to things like my computer/iPad/TV, etc., he has gotten progressively more demanding of me & my husband...expecting us, ALWAYS, to drop what we are doing to help him with something.  I usually do it, and there are days I do it with a smile on my face and other days that I am frustrated and angry that he is not understanding that mom & dad have things/time to be respected as well.  It never sinks in.  It&#39;s been almost a year of transition for us (that&#39;s when I removed him from preschool, so the &quot;deschooling&quot; should be done by now).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am planning on reading The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff for my next child because I do believe that babywearing and co-sleeping has a huge affect on a child...with my son I would always put him down when he fell asleep as a baby...let him cry it out (anything Dr. Spock, you name it, I did it).  I feel I let him down as an infant/baby.  I wasn&#39;t aware of what I was doing then.  I was just following other people&#39;s advice.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some of the other things going on that frustrate me...and no matter how I go into each day (positive or not), I always end up being upset with him and frustrated with myself for being angry/upset.  Every.  Day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * Whining incessantly until he gets whatever it is he wants.  A cookie.  Candy.  Or, with the iPad, he expects that no matter how often, how expensive, etc. it is, he should get whatever game he is requesting...even if it&#39;s out of his league (adult game, etc.)  I have put restrictions on him buying things on the iPad, but the ads from his other games continue to pop up, he sees them and asks me about them.  I either buy it or he ends up upset because I say &quot;no, not today&quot; and explain that we are cutting expenses, etc., and that we cannot buy things whenever we feel like it.  Sometimes this is true, and sometimes it isn&#39;t.  But I still have a voice inside me that says &quot;you cannot give a child everything he asks for all the time!&quot;  If I did, with him, I&#39;d be spending over $100 a week on STUFF.  Stuff he plays with for an hour and then never touches again.  Where should the limit be?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * He tries to hit his sister / calls her names no matter what the issue at hand may be.  Small frustrations = big deals for him.  I do protect her and usually catch him before it happens, but it happens often.  I feel sorry for her...she wants to be his friend and play, but he&#39;s so mean to her all the time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * He wants to play games with us as a family, but can NOT stand to lose.  On days that we don&#39;t want to deal with a melt down, we try to help him win.  On days we are stronger, we try to play right and talk to him throughout the crying and playing that winning isn&#39;t the object...being together as a family and playing together is what matters...that not everyone can win all the time.  You know, real life stuff.  He can&#39;t STAND losing in any capacity.  He wants to play the game (requests to even!), but he doesn&#39;t want to lose...even if he&#39;s behind in the game with still a chance of winning, he&#39;s miserable).  If he&#39;s playing catch with daddy and drops the football, it&#39;s a tragedy and then he doesn&#39;t want to play anymore.  So, he goes and does something easy or plays iPad by himself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; * The moment anything gets even a little challenging, he gives up.  Doesn&#39;t want to do it and says he&#39;s tired.  Then, he goes to play iPad somewhere off by himself.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; See the pattern here?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I realize a lot of this is our fault from going from Love & Logic methods (think Supernanny) to more of an unstructured unschooling/attachment parenting life.  I want to practice attachment parenting with him and be close, but I feel I&#39;ve started too late, he&#39;s drifted from me...he doesn&#39;t want to be close because my frustration with his temperament has pushed him away.  I have even pushed him away in times I knew he needed me because I was so frustrated with how he was acting either toward his sister or another child.  And times that I have gone to him when he was sad/upset, as soon as he calms down, he asks me for the &quot;thing&quot; (whatever it may be) that he wanted that started the meltdown...e.g. cookie, treat, movie, game, etc.)  It&#39;s as if he feigns needing affection to get what he wants...although I know that sounds crazy.  I hope I don&#39;t sound like a horrible mother.  I really want to help our situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is there anything I can do to mend this relationship before it&#39;s too late?  Please help...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you so much in advance.  I really respect this group and look forward to your responses.<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355339965","msgId":69778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGthYWxidCs1MGU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFDNTFFRTJELTJGN0QtNDJGQS05OEU5LTU3QzhERkMwMDUxRUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69777,"nextInTopic":69779,"prevInTime":69777,"nextInTime":69779,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

So if you read &quot;freedom&quot; in something I wrote, I mean the ability to make a lot of real-life choices for himself.   And his choices might be wanting attention and contact.

He is still a pretty little guy. In my book four is a baby and I am not the kind of mother that  treats her kids as &quot;babies&quot;!! Just the other day a friend commented that she thinks it is so funny how I talk to my kids like they are  people but that I talk to my animals like they are babies. HA! <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;* Whining incessantly until he gets whatever it is he wants.  A cookie.  Candy.  Or, with the iPad, he expects that no matter how often, how expensive, etc. it is, he should get whatever game he is requesting...even if it&#39;s out of his league (adult game, etc.)  I have put restrictions on him buying things on the iPad, but the ads from his other games continue to pop up, he sees them and asks me about them.  I either buy it or he ends up upset because I say &quot;no, not today&quot; and explain that we are cutting expenses, etc., and that we cannot buy things whenever we feel like it.  Sometimes this is true, and sometimes it isn&#39;t.  But I still have a voice inside me that says &quot;you cannot give a child everything he asks for all the time!&quot;  If I did, with him, I&#39;d be spending over $100 a week on STUFF.  Stuff he plays with for an hour and then never touches again.  Where should the limit be?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe limit should be that if you cannot afford you cannot get it.  Apps on the Ipad are awesome!!! There are thousands of free ones. Kids learn tons from it. If you can afford them and you are not seeing them as learning tools for your child than you need to deschool way more. Would you looking for limits if he was asking for books. Set a budged that you can afford and give him the apps you can. Be more proactive. Find him free apps. There a thousands of free apps or apps that start out free and you can play until a certain part. That is the kind of apps I get! My kids are happy. My son tries out games all the time!!!!!!  WHy No &quot;not today&quot;?? Research for an app that is similar, for the free version!!!!!!  You are only seeing it as buy or do not buy but there is so much more you can do. Because I have always research prices with my kids they are really savvy! They even research themselves. You would be impressed how my 6 year old can go to Amazon and<br/>\n Ebay and research prices on what she wants , compare shop and save to her lists! And she does not even read fluently yet. She is pretty amazing.  When she was 4  she wanted to buy a lot of things. We would go to goodwill with a budget and shop on the 50% off toy day! Fill up the cart and decided which ones she could buy with that money! Today she will go with me and buy nothing! Giving her , and my son, everything I could afford that they wanted did not turned them into children that want and want and want everything they see. They  are the opposite of that!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n* He tries to hit his sister / calls her names no matter what the issue at hand may be.  Small frustrations = big deals for him.  I do protect her and usually catch him before it happens, but it happens often.  I feel sorry for her...she wants to be his friend and play, but he&#39;s so mean to her all the time.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep protecting her but also protect him from frustrations!!!!!  He is 4 and needs it too!! It is pretty hard for a little guy. MY son used to get really frustrated at that age. I was proactive and protected him too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;* He wants to play games with us as a family, but can NOT stand to lose.  On days that we don&#39;t want to deal with a melt down, we try to help him win.  On days we are stronger, we try to play right and talk to him throughout the crying and playing that winning isn&#39;t the object...being together as a family and playing together is what matters...that not everyone can win all the time.  You know, real life stuff.  He can&#39;t STAND losing in any capacity.  He wants to play the game (requests to even!), but he doesn&#39;t want to lose...even if he&#39;s behind in the game with still a chance of winning, he&#39;s miserable).  If he&#39;s playing catch with daddy and drops the football, it&#39;s a tragedy and then he doesn&#39;t want to play anymore.  So, he goes and does something easy or plays iPad by himself.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n   He is 4! Let him win! In my house when the kids where little we let them play by their rules and win! When Gigi was about that age she would move her pieces ahead of ours and by them my son who was older would laugh!!!! Because he learned that  is was sweet to let the other one win! As they get older they get more serious about games. At 4 you are expecting way too much! WHY can;t he always win???<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;* The moment anything gets even a little challenging, he gives up.  Doesn&#39;t want to do it and says he&#39;s tired.  Then, he goes to play iPad somewhere off by himself.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is 4! Are you worried that he will never do anything that requires work in life ?? Are you calling him lazy or not a go getter? you are projecting way to much  on this 4 year old child. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;See the pattern here?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do  not see is you becoming his partner and being proactive and helping him out . <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I realize a lot of this is our fault from going from Love & Logic methods (think Supernanny) to more of an unstructured unschooling/attachment parenting life.  I want to practice attachment parenting with him and be close, but I feel I&#39;ve started too late, he&#39;s drifted from me...he doesn&#39;t want to be close because my frustration with his temperament has pushed him away.  I have even pushed him away in times I knew he needed me because I was so frustrated with how he was acting either toward his sister or another child.  And times that I have gone to him when he was sad/upset, as soon as he calms down, he asks me for the &quot;thing&quot; (whatever it may be) that he wanted that started the meltdown...e.g. cookie, treat, movie, game, etc.)  It&#39;s as if he feigns needing affection to get what he wants...although I know that sounds crazy.  I hope I don&#39;t sound like a horrible mother.  I really want to help our situation.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI think you are still thinking a lot that way!<br/>\nIf I give him what he wants then...<br/>\nYou are still seeing him as a child that needs &quot;structure&quot; which means punishment if he is not doing exactly what you want.  You are still seeing him as manipulative!<br/>\nIf you give him then then he would walk all over you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Is there anything I can do to mend this relationship before it&#39;s too late?  Please help...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe his partner, give him the cookie , find the apps  that are free and  what you can afford ( would you say not to a book?), be proactive and protect him from frustrations, be sweet and nice to him, play with him, let him win, laugh with him.He is still a very  little guy and he needs a loving mom! See him with loving eyes.See his meltdowns are  him having unmet needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355324412","msgId":69763,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZDQzA1NTIwOURDMzQ3Q0RBQ0JGRDY1RjgxRjQxRTM3QERlYm9yYWhQQz4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGthOXFtYSs2YzBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGthOXFtYSs2YzBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69762,"nextInTopic":69764,"prevInTime":69762,"nextInTime":69764,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***We used to have more structure in our home (when he was going to preschool 3x a week).

Since I&#39;ve let up on structure, added in fun things to do, given him free access to things like my computer/iPad/TV, etc., he has gotten progressively more demanding of me & my husband...expecting us, ALWAYS, to drop what we are doing to help him with something.***<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you looking for a reason to go back to your old way of doing things? Are you looking for permission? You get to do whatever you want. <br/>\n<br/>\n***...given him free access to things like my computer/iPad/TV, etc., he has gotten progressively more demanding of me & my husband...***<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you trying to occupy his time with those things? Computers, iPads and TV’s can be a wonderful part of life but should not be substitutes for time with you. If you’re giving him the iPad to play with so that you’ll have more time to do something else that’s not going to feel satisfying to him. If he wants *you* he can’t be happy with a computer. It ought to comfort you that you are of more value to him than an iPad. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever read any of those horrible Harry Harlow maternal separation experiments?  (I’m not recommending you read them now.) I’m not suggesting your son is a Rhesus monkey but pointing out the warm, physical contact of a mother or father is essential for little beings. And the more you deny him by trying to replace your self with things the more he will feel needy. <br/>\n<br/>\n***...expecting us, ALWAYS, to drop what we are doing to help him with something.***<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle children should *always* be able to expect help from their parents. If not you then who? Who should he be able to count on? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a two year old so your four year old probably looks big to you and by comparison probably seems capable. But he’s still little. He still needs you. And since he’s already had to make room for a little sister and give up some of his time with you because of her, he probably feeling even more as if he’s losing out with another baby coming. What will he have to do to get your time and attention with the new baby comes? <br/>\n<br/>\n***I am frustrated and angry that he is not understanding that mom & dad have things/time to be respected as well.***<br/>\n<br/>\nLittle children shouldn’t have to think about what their parents need. They should be getting their needs met by the adults who knew what they were doing when they had a child. : )  The only way a person learns about respect is by feeling the value of being respected. Are you showing respect to him when he needs you and you get angry and frustrated? Learning about respect takes just as much time as it takes. It’s not something four year olds typically understand. You’re expecting too much from him.  The quickest way to be less frustrated is to have realistic expectations of what a four year old is capable of and what he needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n***I would always put him down when he fell asleep as a baby...let him cry it out...***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou’re still doing that.  That’s what if feels like to him to have you always busy with something/someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n***Whining incessantly until he gets whatever it is he wants.***<br/>\n<br/>\nListen to him and help him get what he wants the first time he asks and he won’t have to whine. Sit close to him and touch him and be loving when he eats his cookies or candy. Be sweet and be *with* him. <br/>\n<br/>\n***...he expects that no matter how often, how expensive, etc. it is, he should get whatever game he is requesting...***<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe’s trying to fill a void and he’ll fill it with games if he can’t have enough of you. Play the games with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n***he ends up upset because I say &quot;no, not today&quot; ***<br/>\n<br/>\nHow often does he hear “no, not today” or “in a minute” or “maybe later”?  Stop putting him off. Maybe you can’t buy every game he wants but it’s probably not about the games anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n***He tries to hit his sister / calls her names no matter what the issue at hand may be. Small frustrations = big deals for him. I do protect her and usually catch him before it happens, but it happens often. I feel sorry for her...she wants to be his friend and play, but he&#39;s so mean to her all the time.***<br/>\n<br/>\nShe moved into his house, his life, took away his time with you and wants his stuff. If your partner brought home another wife you’d probably not feel very kindly toward her. That’s how it feels to him. <br/>\n<br/>\n***He wants to play games with us as a family, but can NOT stand to lose.***<br/>\n<br/>\nLet him win. Change the rules so he can play happily. Let him change the rules. Let him win. It won’t last forever. He’ll get older and understand better. <br/>\n<br/>\n***The moment anything gets even a little challenging, he gives up. Doesn&#39;t want to do it and says he&#39;s tired. Then, he goes to play iPad somewhere off by himself.***<br/>\n<br/>\nIf everything in his life feels like a challenge, navigating his sister, getting your attention, getting time with you, getting what he wants, one more challenge is too hard to take. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf either you or his father are competitive then he might be naturally competitive and at four, not yet coordinated or big enough to accomplish the grand things he can think of, or picture himself accomplishing.  That can be very frustrating. Find games to play that he can be good at. Modify how you play so that he can feel successful. If it’s not fun for him, stop. <br/>\n<br/>\n***See the pattern here?***<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  It looks like a pattern of you being too busy or tired or self involved to give him the time and attention and consideration he needs. He’s four. You seem to not be considering how very, very little he is, and how much he needs mothering.  Maybe you can hire a mother’s helper so that she can be with him and play with him when you’re too busy, or play with his sister so you can be with him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***I realize a lot of this is our fault from going from Love & Logic methods (think Supernanny) to more of an unstructured unschooling/attachment parenting life. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nYou’re blaming unschooling when it’s your behavior that’s the problem. If you were stricter and structured he needs to spend lots of sweet time with you to feel like he can trust you now to be more attached and loving. You can not be attachment parenting if you repeatedly put him off or try to occupy him with things so that you can do something else. Attach. Be with him. Play with him. Be sweet to him. Be interested in what he’s doing. Listen to him. Help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you’re busy but it’s a choice to have three children. You’re grown up. You knew children would require your time. He needs as much of your time as *he* needs, not as much as you feel like offering. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***Is there anything I can do to mend this relationship before it&#39;s too late?***<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely! It’s not too late. He’s four! But he’s not the one who needs to change. You need to seem him for who he is. He’s a baby trying the only way he knows to cope with a new sister, another baby on the way, and a mom who’s very often too busy or tired for him. He’s not the one who needs to change. If you want to be close with him, that requires your physical closeness, your time, your bountiful, loving, happy attention. It requires you to stop looking at him through the negative lens you seem to not be able to put aside. Look at and think about the wonderful things about him. If you find yourself thinking negatively about him stop yourself and deliberately think of something sweet. Hug him. Smile warmly at him. He’s not the one who needs to change. <br/>\n<br/>\nFind ways to spend time with him. Can you snuggle up with him in bed at night while your partner is with the two year old? Can you talk sweetly about whatever he likes, read stories, tell him stories about when he was a baby?  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes your two year old nap? When she’s asleep can you cuddle up with him, or play with him? You might be tempted to try to get something else done but spend that time with him. If you’re tried and need to rest, rest near him, invite him to snuggle. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan your invite him to help with fun things. Dylan used to like to sit on the kitchen counter and visit with me while I was cooking. Sometimes he’d sit with his feet in the sink full of water.<br/>\nCan you think of fun things he’d like to do and offer those? Would he like to color with you, sort buttons, play cars, watch a movie, dance, play with balloons, chop celery? Think of fun things and do them.<br/>\nCan you go for a walk with him? Even a short walk around your neighborhood can feel like an adventure. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355323343","msgId":69762,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4ODk5QzU2LUFCODMtNDhFQS04N0FELTczMzQwQThENjZERUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGthOXFtYSs2YzBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGthOXFtYSs2YzBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":69761,"nextInTopic":69763,"prevInTime":69761,"nextInTime":69763,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A cookie. Candy<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why does he need to wait for those?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect what&#39;s happened is that previously when he asked in more acceptable ways they didn&#39;t work. So now he just skips to what does work. Rather than trying to disconnect his only tool that&#39;s working, focus on the cause: needs that he can&#39;t meet himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are your son&#39;s power to manipulate the world. When he needs something he can&#39;t get on his own, you&#39;re like a mechanical hand that only works occasionally and randomly. Imagine how frustrating that would be!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile no one can have everything they want, what he&#39;s not getting is more than he can handle. He&#39;ll be able to handle the nos better when *he* trusts you want him to be happy and will try what you can to meet his needs rather than whimsically -- as it seems to him -- saying yes or no.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he whines you can say -- as you&#39;re getting what he is asking for and not angrily -- &quot;I can understand what you want better if you speak in a normal voice.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I either buy it or he ends up upset because I say &quot;no, not today&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>To him whether you say yes or no seems completely random. He has no control over when he can have a game and when he can&#39;t. So he asks for way more than what he needs. It&#39;s like playing the lottery. He needs to ask for 10 things to get 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile lots of kids go through a need to have lots and lots and lots, which is part of discovering what they like, perhaps you can give him a budget. Make a list of what he wants. Help him to slow down and make more thoughtful decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to cut down on the random ads he sees? Are there sites he can play on that might be less flashy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He wants to play games with us as a family, but can NOT stand to lose. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Until he can take losing, change the rules so the game isn&#39;t frustrating to him. Give him more of an advantage.

Don&#39;t see it as giving up on challenge. See it as him choosing to not be frustrated for something that doesn&#39;t seem worth it right now. He will grow better able to handle frustration. Don&#39;t add to it with your own frustration and need for him to be someone other than who he is.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have even pushed him away in times I knew he needed me<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Often when they&#39;re at their worst is when they need you the most. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":479109089,"authorName":"Jen","from":"&quot;Jen&quot; &lt;jenyoust@...&gt;","profile":"boo_boo_flower","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"My Anger & Frustration with my son ...I can&#39;t get over it.","postDate":"1355312650","msgId":69761,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGthOXFtYSs2YzBxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69762,"prevInTime":69760,"nextInTime":69762,"topicId":69761,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am at a standstill about how to go about communicating and being with my 4-year old son.

I also have a 2 year old daughter and am pregnant with #3 (due in Jan.)  I am tired and frustrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I thought was a phase has proven to be more of a temperament thing.  My son, through no fault of his own due to my changes in parenting throughout this last year, is whiny, lost, bored and confused.  We used to have more structure in our home (when he was going to preschool 3x a week).  Since I&#39;ve let up on structure, added in fun things to do, given him free access to things like my computer/iPad/TV, etc., he has gotten progressively more demanding of me & my husband...expecting us, ALWAYS, to drop what we are doing to help him with something.  I usually do it, and there are days I do it with a smile on my face and other days that I am frustrated and angry that he is not understanding that mom & dad have things/time to be respected as well.  It never sinks in.  It&#39;s been almost a year of transition for us (that&#39;s when I removed him from preschool, so the &quot;deschooling&quot; should be done by now).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am planning on reading The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff for my next child because I do believe that babywearing and co-sleeping has a huge affect on a child...with my son I would always put him down when he fell asleep as a baby...let him cry it out (anything Dr. Spock, you name it, I did it).  I feel I let him down as an infant/baby.  I wasn&#39;t aware of what I was doing then.  I was just following other people&#39;s advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the other things going on that frustrate me...and no matter how I go into each day (positive or not), I always end up being upset with him and frustrated with myself for being angry/upset.  Every.  Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Whining incessantly until he gets whatever it is he wants.  A cookie.  Candy.  Or, with the iPad, he expects that no matter how often, how expensive, etc. it is, he should get whatever game he is requesting...even if it&#39;s out of his league (adult game, etc.)  I have put restrictions on him buying things on the iPad, but the ads from his other games continue to pop up, he sees them and asks me about them.  I either buy it or he ends up upset because I say &quot;no, not today&quot; and explain that we are cutting expenses, etc., and that we cannot buy things whenever we feel like it.  Sometimes this is true, and sometimes it isn&#39;t.  But I still have a voice inside me that says &quot;you cannot give a child everything he asks for all the time!&quot;  If I did, with him, I&#39;d be spending over $100 a week on STUFF.  Stuff he plays with for an hour and then never touches again.  Where should the limit be?<br/>\n<br/>\n* He tries to hit his sister / calls her names no matter what the issue at hand may be.  Small frustrations = big deals for him.  I do protect her and usually catch him before it happens, but it happens often.  I feel sorry for her...she wants to be his friend and play, but he&#39;s so mean to her all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n* He wants to play games with us as a family, but can NOT stand to lose.  On days that we don&#39;t want to deal with a melt down, we try to help him win.  On days we are stronger, we try to play right and talk to him throughout the crying and playing that winning isn&#39;t the object...being together as a family and playing together is what matters...that not everyone can win all the time.  You know, real life stuff.  He can&#39;t STAND losing in any capacity.  He wants to play the game (requests to even!), but he doesn&#39;t want to lose...even if he&#39;s behind in the game with still a chance of winning, he&#39;s miserable).  If he&#39;s playing catch with daddy and drops the football, it&#39;s a tragedy and then he doesn&#39;t want to play anymore.  So, he goes and does something easy or plays iPad by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The moment anything gets even a little challenging, he gives up.  Doesn&#39;t want to do it and says he&#39;s tired.  Then, he goes to play iPad somewhere off by himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee the pattern here?<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize a lot of this is our fault from going from Love & Logic methods (think Supernanny) to more of an unstructured unschooling/attachment parenting life.  I want to practice attachment parenting with him and be close, but I feel I&#39;ve started too late, he&#39;s drifted from me...he doesn&#39;t want to be close because my frustration with his temperament has pushed him away.  I have even pushed him away in times I knew he needed me because I was so frustrated with how he was acting either toward his sister or another child.  And times that I have gone to him when he was sad/upset, as soon as he calms down, he asks me for the &quot;thing&quot; (whatever it may be) that he wanted that started the meltdown...e.g. cookie, treat, movie, game, etc.)  It&#39;s as if he feigns needing affection to get what he wants...although I know that sounds crazy.  I hope I don&#39;t sound like a horrible mother.  I really want to help our situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything I can do to mend this relationship before it&#39;s too late?  Please help...<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much in advance.  I really respect this group and look forward to your responses.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69793,"nextTopicId":69849}}
