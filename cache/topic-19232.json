We rotate partners often in the class.  In the <br/>\nfirst class there was one man who said to me, when I asked how he was doing that <br/>\nhis ego was suffering, since he couldn&#39;t seem to learn the basic step we were <br/>\nworking on.  I noticed after the lesson that his wife was trying to help him <br/>\nwith it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Friday we had our second lesson.  I wasn&#39;t surprised to notice they <br/>\nweren&#39;t at class.  I think it is sad to think that often if there is something we <br/>\ncan&#39;t do well, we don&#39;t want to do it.  I&#39;ve noticed with the contra dancing I <br/>\ndo there are beginners that seem to &quot;get&quot; it right away.  I think of them as <br/>\n&quot;body&quot; learners.  And then there are those that learn thro their heads, and they <br/>\ncount and analyze the dances and the music.  If these people hang in there, <br/>\nthey too become good dancers, it just takes longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a poor skiier, a slow jogger and hiker, and a good dancer, but I love it <br/>\nall.  I think I read it in Wayne Dwyer&#39;s book - that if you don&#39;t have to be <br/>\n&quot;good&quot; there you can do a lot of things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I also believe that if you try something, and don&#39;t like doing it, you <br/>\nhave learned that, and don&#39;t need to &quot;stick in there&quot;, it is OK to move on to <br/>\nsomething you do find interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":129679134,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","profile":"leschke2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: quitting","postDate":"1081188445","msgId":19248,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYuMC4wLjIyLjAuMjAwNDA0MDUxMDAyNTMuMDJmNzEwMTBAc2hhd21haWwuZ3Yuc2hhd2NhYmxlLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFmMC4xZDMxN2IwOC4yZGEyMDU4Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFmMC4xZDMxN2IwOC4yZGEyMDU4Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19232,"nextInTopic":19310,"prevInTime":19247,"nextInTime":19249,"topicId":19232,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
