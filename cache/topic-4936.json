I accept that I may be wrong here as I havn&#39;t <br/>\nseen every episode of either of these shows so if I&#39;m wrong please <br/>\ncorrect me.  And if you have more examples let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge Shrinks: A saturday morning cartoon on our local PBS station.  <br/>\nI think it&#39;s based on a book series.  The guy (George) is 3 inches <br/>\ntall and lives with his mom, dad, and his &#39;little&#39; brother Junior.  <br/>\nAs far as I can see he doesn&#39;t go to school.  And he&#39;s extremly <br/>\nbright.  His parent&#39;s are both VERY cool.  :)  His mom is an artist <br/>\nand his father is a musician/inventor.  I love their parenting <br/>\nstyle :)  I&#39;ve never seen an episode where they tried to teach the <br/>\nkids anything they didn&#39;t want to know.  And the kids are both very <br/>\ninquisitive.  OK I understand that these aren&#39;t real people :)  I <br/>\nknow it&#39;s not even based on real people but it&#39;s good!!  LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other one I was thinking of is Pokemon.  Does anyone know if I&#39;m <br/>\nwrong here??  Seems to me that Ash is off on his own adventure and <br/>\nlearning tons of stuff.  I think if this were real life people would <br/>\nbe very worried about the fact that all he&#39;s interested in is pokemon <br/>\nbut think of all of the life experience he&#39;s gaining.  And what a <br/>\ngreat mom he has to let him go and do all that :)  Maybe he did go to <br/>\nschool.  I don&#39;t know.  If so I didn&#39;t see that episode.  Anyone <br/>\nelse??<br/>\n<br/>\nKatie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4901,"nextTopicId":4937}}
