I&#39;ve been<br/>\n </span></blockquote>afraid the traditional piano lessons with teachers who all expect their<br/>\nstudents to practice so many hours a week, and playing the usual boring<br/>\nsongs in beginner&#39;s books, would just zap their fun and interest in<br/>\nwanting to play.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHi, I highly recommend you order a few books from <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pianimals.com/\">http://www.pianimals.com/</a><br/>\nFor less than ten bucks, a person could play several familiar songs in <br/>\nprobably less than 30 minutes, depending on the person and age.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, my question is simply, are traditional piano lessons or using a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>non-traditional approach ( as the simply Music), a good match for<br/>\nchildren who already show interest in wanting to learn to play the<br/>\npiano? Especially, for children as young as 6 ond 8. My kids have<br/>\nshown an interest in the piano and other instruments for years. I &#39;d<br/>\njust hate to suddenly zap it becuase of the wrong type of lessons. And,<br/>\nI figured several on this list have had experience with their kids<br/>\nlearning to play the piano and was hoping to hear their first hand<br/>\nexperiences and advise.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m a professional pianist and a private piano teacher ... a few <br/>\nthoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Whenever someone calls me about lessons and their child is six or <br/>\nyounger, I would immediately forward them to the local MusikGarten <br/>\nteacher. To me, this is much more age-appropriate and money better <br/>\nspent than private lessons, at that age.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I&#39;m always amazed at how people never &quot;shop around&quot; for a private <br/>\nteacher. I would always tell people to interview (with their child) at <br/>\nleast three different teachers before making a decision. I have never <br/>\nknown a single person to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a big reason so many people get disatisfied with lessons and <br/>\nwant to quit is because it never ocurred to the parents to try to find <br/>\nthe right match before beginning. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome teachers have all their students do basically the same <br/>\nassignments; some really work to tailor the pieces to what each <br/>\nspecific student would like. Some teachers are BIG on incentive <br/>\nprograms; others don&#39;t use them at all. Some teachers require students <br/>\nto write down how many minutes they practice each day. Some teachers <br/>\nrequire participation in a recital. Others don&#39;t even provide that <br/>\nopportunity. And on and on. And personalities are just different ... <br/>\nwho does your child just feel comfortable being around?<br/>\n<br/>\n- BTW, even if a child is learning through a &quot;traditional&quot; method, a <br/>\ngood teacher, IMO, should certainly have students be doing <br/>\nimprovisation and other more &quot;creative&quot; activities. One of the signs of <br/>\na good teacher is that they use way more than just a single method book <br/>\nor series.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and feel free to e-mail me off the list if you want to talk <br/>\nabout it more.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenny</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28363,"nextTopicId":28391}}
