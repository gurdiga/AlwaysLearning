It tends to<br/>\neke away my independence until I find myself turning to the list to see<br/>\n&quot;what the others would do.&quot;  We are from Austin but have lived in the San<br/>\nFrancisco area for almost eight years and just moved down to San Diego.  I<br/>\nwould say we&#39;ve had mostly an unschooling life at home too, I don&#39;t believe<br/>\nin punishments and we try to guide our home life around respecting each<br/>\nother and not being controlling.<br/>\n <br/>\nOur move to San Diego took us by surprise and we have been really sad at<br/>\nleaving our San Francisco friends.  Also, a month before the move, we lost<br/>\nour cat to some unknown illness, suddenly and catastrophically (the girls<br/>\npetted her good bye by sticking their arms through a hole in the wall of an<br/>\noxygenated tank, plugging the gaps with a jacket because the first time we<br/>\ntried, enough oxygen seeped out so that she began thrashing).

She&#39;d wanted to try school once before and we found<br/>\na place that would let her go for a day, and after visiting she didn&#39;t want<br/>\nto go any more (she didn&#39;t want to have to get up early).

One reason she wants to go is to make friends.  Another is that<br/>\nshe is simply curious about school.  I do believe she would get tired of it<br/>\nsooner or later, as she picks up knowledge quickly and gets bored easily.

I find the brain process fascinating. Maybe some of the reading helps me realize that our son being able to say all 12 months of the year, but never in order is &quot;normal&quot; for his dyslexic brain.  (I cannot say them all without saying them in order)  But through the unschooling / deschooling process I also know that he will either learn it when he needs to or he will learn to use a planner to help him in his adult life (or some other tool to aide himself).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur son is 13 and still does not write - well rarely anyway.  There have been a few times within the past couple of months he has spontaneously written several pages documenting some game he played.  He balks at even signing his name - which he had to do to take riding lessons this fall.  He has also taken an interest in reading game guides and Manga books within the past year.  A year ago he was still asking for everything to be read to him; now he will read an entire Manga series or a 100 page game guide (single spaced and size 12 font).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning he built with legos and anything else he could get his hands on: rocks, sticks, blankets, pillows, furniture, Zomes, boxes, Imaginext, boards. He would spend days and weeks building complex structures in the family room - or digging a hole in the back yard.  He looked at a lot of books - such as eyewitness - learning from pictures and small captions beneath them.  Anything visual was/is up for grabs with him - such as books, videos, movies, documentaries, TV, DVD&#39;s, Board games, computer games, recently he has taken an interest in system games such as Play Station II, Wii, etc.<br/>\n(I do believe it was cheaper to dig a hole - ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if this was deschooling or unschooling.

What did the deschooling process look like to you? How did your  <br/>\nchild do with it? How did you do with it?<br/>\n <br/>\nBoth of my school aged kids stopped going to school a year ago and we have  <br/>\nspent the last year blissfully at home, not under anyone else&#39;s agenda. Yet, <br/>\nI&#39;m  still have a hard time with thinking more schoolish stuff should be  done! <br/>\nFor instance, my son (almost 11), has anxiety about not being able to  write. <br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t want to work on writing, but when he is faced with the task  (like <br/>\nat his beloved summer camp), he freezes. My school side says I should  break <br/>\nout a writing curriculum. My unschooling side says differently. I believe  that <br/>\nschool has created a lot of anxiety in all of us!<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I guess my question to you is: Is deschooling more for the parents or  the <br/>\nkids? Is it a developmental process that will unfold over the years? Does it  <br/>\never end?<br/>\n <br/>\nI would appreciate any deschooling experiences anyone would like to  share.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** Get a sneak peek of the all-new AOL at <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour\">http://discover.aol.com/memed/aolcom30tour</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":85626510,"authorName":"Dawn Falbe","from":"&quot;Dawn Falbe&quot; &lt;astrologerdawn@...&gt;","profile":"astrologerdawn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Deschooling","postDate":"1031924504","msgId":9323,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyNWIyYiQ1MTA4Mzk1MCQxNDhlZGQxOEBkYXduPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMzE5MDA4NTguMzMwLjMwNjc4Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2371,"nextInTopic":30453,"prevInTime":9322,"nextInTime":9324,"topicId":2371,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Mary: I wish I had a timetable from when the deschooling process is over with me.

LOL <br/>\nWell, at least I had a head start when I REALLY<br/>\nstarted as a teen, because I never went all the way,<br/>\nnever played the game.  I REALLY hated school.  I am<br/>\nsure some of that was the home issues and the<br/>\ndepression, but I used to hide under my bed or in the<br/>\nattic in the carriage house/garage when I was in<br/>\ngradeschool to avoid going.  Even when I was there I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t do what I was told and seldom did homework.  I<br/>\nwas a discipline nightmare for the school folks.  heh<br/>\nheh<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got to Middle School, I got REALLY<br/>\nuncooperative.  ;-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
