But wearing a helmet for biking or skiing is handled in our house similarly to other","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1274413363\"><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"top\">My son is young ( 6 in August) so maybe my experience is limited. But wearing a helmet for biking or skiing is handled in our house similarly to other decisions - according to unschooling principles. Who says that there needs to be an either  &quot; do what ever you want&quot; or a &quot;without helmet no bike&quot; kind of attitude ?<br/><br/>My husband and I are wearing helmets and are explaining why. I am in the medical field, have seen many, many devastating head injuries to prior perfectly healthy people ( some wearing helmets, most without) and for myself wearing a helmet is not bothersome enough to risk being neurologically hurt. I feel the same about seat belts. They do safe lives and while they don&#39;t guarantee me not to be killed by something (I still could get cancer, be hit by a car as a pedestrian, be shot, and many more possibilities) they lower the risk of being ejected from my car in an\n accident. It&#39;s a simple risk/benefit analysis - which might be different for different people or activities. <br/>Lukas has always seen us wearing helmets while biking and skiing, he chose his own helmet (he had very specific ideas how it needed to look like ), we had discussions why I wear a helmet (matter of fact, not driven by fear) and when he forgets to put his on I will say something along the lines of &quot;hey, you forgot your helmet - let me get it for you&quot;. He decorated his bike and ski helmet with his favorite stickers and wearing them seems not to bother him. He has forgotten to put his helmet on but if I make it easy to wear the helmet he has not chosen to not wear it.<br/><br/>This discussion picks up in some ways the recent threat about teeth brushing. In my experience teeth brushing has health benefits. The benefits are bigger than the inconvenience to me. My husband and I brush our teeth regularly and my son joins us the same way he joins us\n in other things we do. We try to make it fun and &quot;just another thing we do&quot; without drama when it doesn&#39;t happen once in a while. When my son was little he loved for me to find wild animals in his mouth. Now at almost 6 he still wants me to brush his teeth - and I enjoy doing it since it has almost gotten to the status of a little love ritual.<br/><br/>I brought the teeth brushing up again since I think both situations (helmets and teeth brushing) become a problem if they turn into an all or nothing situation, if they are handled inflexible or as some kind of parent enforced law. Granted my son is young and things might change, but making healthy choices easy and fun, walking my talk and having honest, unemotional discussion has helped us a lot. Not letting my fear of what could happen if he doesn&#39;t (brush his teeth, wear a helmet, get enough sleep, stop climbing up this tree, ......) cloud my approach of these situations seems to have helped to make\n them just another opportunity to help my son to make thoughtful decisions rather than a confrontation. <br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing. The argument &quot;I used to ..... as a child and I turned out fine&quot; seems weak on this kind of list. We all survived all kinds of suboptimal situations as children and are obviously still alive. What I love about this list is that we all try to make the lives of our children better and not just survivable.....<br/><br/>Sabine<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://overview.mail.yahoo.com?.src=iOS\"><br/><br/>Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPad</a></td></tr></table>            <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1274413363_origMsg_\">\n                <div>\n                    <br />\n                    <div>\n                        <div style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">\n                            <hr size=\"1\">\n                            <b>\n                                <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">From:</span>\n                            </b>\n                            Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;;                            <br>\n                            <b>\n                                <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">To:</span>\n                            </b>\n                             &lt;AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com&gt;;                                                                                                     <br>\n                            <b>\n                                <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Subject:</span>\n                            </b>\n                            Re: [AlwaysLearning] Roller blading helmet question                            <br>\n                            <b>\n                                <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Sent:</span>\n                            </b>\n                            Tue, Apr 29, 2014 2:17:34 PM                            <br>\n                        </div>\n                            <br>\n                            <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n                                <tbody>\n                                    <tr>\n                                        <td valign=\"top\">\n<span> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1274413363ygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1274413363ygrp-msg\" style=\"\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1274413363ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p>-=-<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Not a dent in the helmet but she still ended up brain dead. -=-</span></p><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br clear=\"none\"></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Sorry about your sister.   Stories like that stun people in sad but good ways.  Every living child alive.  No child&#39;s life can be guaranteed by anything.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br clear=\"none\"></span></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">The Olympics seems altogether dangerous, from ski jumps to diving all the way down to young children being pressured to train for the Olympics when they&#39;re only five or six years old.</span></font></div><div><font\n face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br clear=\"none\"></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Dangerous physically, emotionally, financially.</span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br clear=\"none\"></span></font></div><div><font face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Sandra</span></font></div>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div></div>\n\n\n</td>\n                                    </tr>\n                                </tbody>\n                            </table>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Roller blading helmet question","postDate":"1398781054","msgId":74171,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJGNzIwOUFBLTg2QzktNDZEQi1CNzNDLTYyNjRDRkU5ODY5MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxqb2F2YisxdGxhYWsyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PHljY25wNXJmc2loMms1OHkzM245aGd2OS4xMzk4NzI0OTE1NTUyQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPiA8bGpvYXZiKzF0bGFhazJAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74168,"nextInTopic":74174,"prevInTime":74170,"nextInTime":74172,"topicId":74128,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Not a dent in the helmet but she still ended up brain dead. -=- Sorry about your sister.

What is pretty well agreed on though is that helmet legislation significantly decreases participation - so fewer people cycle if helmets are required. From a public health point of view this is something of an own goal, as more people cycling = improvement in other public health measures (lifespan, general health, etc). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t wear a bike helmet, and I used to be a cycle instructor. (In the UK, where there is no law requiring it.) Some of my fellow instructors did wear one, most didn&#39;t. We didn&#39;t recommend in either direction, but encouraged people to do their own research (helmets may actually increase some risks eg rotational injury). To friends, I say: do whatever makes you most likely to get on your bike :) if you feel happier with a helmet, wear one; if not, then not. But do make sure you have lights at night and obey road rules, and it&#39;s a very good idea to learn about best safe practice for road riding (either through lessons or books or online or whatever suits you). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279436458,"authorName":"Clare Kirkpatrick","from":"Clare Kirkpatrick &lt;clare.kirkpatrick@...&gt;","profile":"clarekirkp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Roller blading helmet question","postDate":"1398747673","msgId":74153,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0MXBsdHJic2xkMTlna3ZtcThqNHFscC4xMzk4NzQ3NjczNzM5QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":74152,"nextInTopic":74154,"prevInTime":74152,"nextInTime":74154,"topicId":74128,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m a nurse.

If it&#39;s the footpath where the most that&#39;s likely to happen are sore knees and elbows or bottom, I will still encourage and suggest a helmet is good idea but allow them to make the choice because they are unlikely to be going fast enough to sustain any serious injury to their head on the footpath on rollerskates.</div><div><br></div><div>Our trampoline safety net deteriorated from several years of our summer sun a while ago.
