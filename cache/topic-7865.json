I <br/>\nthink it is important to know the rules. Then you can break the rules <br/>\ncreatively and effectively. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy method for writing is to get the ideas down. They flow so quickly, <br/>\nyou have to capture them. Then I refine them using the mechanics of <br/>\nlanguage. When I was editing, I appreciated the effort that good <br/>\nwriters took to make their ideas presentable and exciting. I did not <br/>\nalways have the time to walk those that had great ideas through the <br/>\nrevision stage. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think good writing is a balanced composition of exciting ideas and <br/>\nexacting mechanics. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] defense of teaching the mechanics of writing","postDate":"1026679113","msgId":7866,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNzE0MjAzODMzLjkxNTc4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA0Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5Yy41M2JkNzY5LjJhNjMzOWZmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7865,"nextInTopic":7874,"prevInTime":7865,"nextInTime":7867,"topicId":7865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So I m not very ...

Makes you<br/>\nwonder if any of these teachers actually consider the<br/>\nmerits of REAL Literature, with all it&#39;s rule breaking<br/>\nand original perspective.  Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>\nthe crap examples in grammar text books? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching writing to kids I very rarely commented on the structure <br/>\nor content, because in many cases that was their private business.  I usually <br/>\nONLY went for mechanics of writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m teaching beginning calligraphers, I don&#39;t want them to imagine what <br/>\na Carolingian &quot;f&quot; COULD have looked at, I want them to learn to copy actual <br/>\nperiod examples.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m helping people learn to play recorder (as I did with Kirby a couple <br/>\nof nights ago), I really do want them to tongue every note.  YES there are <br/>\nexceptions galore after you learn to do it right, but it&#39;s one thing to <br/>\nchoose when not to tongue, and another not to have the skill to do it and so <br/>\njust skip and claim &quot;art.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith calligraphy, in fact there might be hundreds of different examples of <br/>\nextant Carolingian hand, with a large range of forms of letters.  But that&#39;s <br/>\nnot the same as &quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;no rules.&quot;  Some of the most wonderful <br/>\ncalligraphy is someone &quot;doing a riff&quot; on some descender, or getting way artsy <br/>\nwith a line ending or a capital letter.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLiterature is full of exceptions.  Jazz is full of exceptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when a person is cluefree about how to do something &quot;right,&quot; his <br/>\n&quot;embellishments&quot; aren&#39;t creativity so much as flailing around.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people&#39;s flailing around creates art.  There are artists and musicians <br/>\nwho pretty much made it up on their own.  Some have an audience of one, <br/>\nthough, and are only amusing themselves.  Others discover something that has <br/>\nbroader appeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt; Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>\nthe crap examples in grammar text books?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always enjoyed the history of English, the technicalities of <br/>\npunctuation, the changing fashions involving word use and style.  I&#39;ve never <br/>\nexpected everyone else to think it was cool, but I actually enjoyed the crap <br/>\nexamples in grammar textbooks, sometime.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I never once used a grammar text book when I was teaching.  We <br/>\nkept the books in their boxes at the back of the room, and used dictionaries. <br/>\n We played games with parts of speech sometimes, and goofed with them various <br/>\nways.  We would lay out all the synonyms we could think of for something and <br/>\ntry to identify without looking them up which were of what origin, and which <br/>\nwere the oldest.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But I am certain that the passion I have for<br/>\nthe written word was long delayed due to those years<br/>\nof forced writing.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Shame on them.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not ashamed for using writing to help people write.  Our usual in-class <br/>\nwriting system was that they were to write three one-page (or longer) <br/>\nanythings.  Little stories, reviews, opinions.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Three <br/>\npages.  They picked the one they liked best, or thought was the best on top, <br/>\nfastened the three together and over the weekend I read through at least all <br/>\nthe top pages, sometimes more.  I wasn&#39;t criticizing their organization or <br/>\nstyle.  That was going to get better as they just wrote more.  I was only <br/>\nlooking at mechanics.  Spelling, grammar, punctuation, sentence structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have collected my paycheck without doing that.  I could have passed <br/>\nout those books and gone through some dumbass exercise every day and NEVER <br/>\nworked outside my prep period, but I didn&#39;t.  Because I like writing and I <br/>\nknow writing is scary, I tried to help make it a common, non-threatening, <br/>\namusing thing for them.  If they hadn&#39;t had me as an English teacher they <br/>\nwould have had someone worse.  So I&#39;m not very ashamed of the way I taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m somewhat ashamed that I couldn&#39;t change things more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7873,"nextTopicId":7869}}
