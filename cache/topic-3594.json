 well, i think it&#39;s wonderful, in theory and in<br/>\naction, which is why we&#39;ve ascribed to it.  i didn&#39;t learn until late last year<br/>\nthat what we were doing had a name, and i tend to resist labels, but unschooling<br/>\nit must be.  i don&#39;t have a singular best story -- what i have is a child who<br/>\nabsorbs the world around him like a sponge, and i can&#39;t even imagine interferring<br/>\nwith that.  we just try to facilitate and enjoy, and it&#39;s wonderful -- and in the<br/>\nprocess, we&#39;re learning something new (or relearning something we&#39;d forgotten)<br/>\nevery day.  one interest flows smoothly into another, and pretty soon we&#39;re<br/>\nhanging home-made planetary mobiles from the ceiling, then reading about<br/>\nastrology, and then looking for constellations in the night sky, which leads to<br/>\nthe reading of some simplified greek or roman myths.  the garden is our second<br/>\nhome (if that could be said of something that&#39;s a part of one&#39;s home), and the<br/>\nlibrary is our third home -- we&#39;re all home together, and the unschooling life is<br/>\nglorious.  the only concerns are the isolation aspect.  i won&#39;t go into the<br/>\nsocialization thing, because i think we all agree that the &quot;but what about<br/>\nsocialization question?&quot; is b.s., but we have only one child, and in the winter<br/>\nit&#39;s especially hard to find folks to gather with on a regular basis.  our local<br/>\nhomeschooling group is absolutely wonderful -- i&#39;m so grateful to have found such<br/>\na supportive, interesting group -- but it&#39;s winter, folks are hibernating<br/>\n(including us -- we didn&#39;t get out of bed until 10, which is why i&#39;m still stuck<br/>\nworking now), and sometimes i feel like we&#39;re not getting out as much as we<br/>\n&quot;should.&quot;  other frustration is a lack of interesting chapter books for little<br/>\nones who are still young enough to get scared by, well, scary topics, but a<br/>\nfriend just turned me on to thornton burgess, and i just rediscovered the wind in<br/>\nthe willows and the littles, and so hope is not lost...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;&lt; let me get this straight -- you think that defensiveness is a positive<br/>\n&gt; trait in terms of interpersonal communication?

OK - we started homeschooling in September, unschooling in November.  But of course I didn&#39;t get the unschooling thing at first and thought I had to just give them fun ways to do the 5 subjects. I bought a math game to give them at Christmas.  When the game came by UPS, I didn&#39;t remember what it was so I let my dd open it.  I say what it was, quickly swept it away and said to forget it.  Well by Christmas, I was understanding unschooling a little more and I felt like a heel for getting them an educational gift for Christmas so I didn&#39;t give it to them.  This week my dd asked why I didn&#39;t give them the game she saw and asked if she could get it.  I told her it was a math game thinking she would not be interested.  They have been playing the game all week and love it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] :  experience, age, and judging","postDate":"1012536113","msgId":3685,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MC44MTIzMDY1LjI5OGI2ZDMxQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3675,"nextInTopic":3688,"prevInTime":3684,"nextInTime":3686,"topicId":3594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/31/02 7:04:10 PM, wordup@mother.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-78066806\">In a message dated 1/31/02 7:04:10 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wordup@...\">wordup@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; let me get this straight -- you think that defensiveness is a positive <br/>\ntrait in<br/>\nterms of interpersonal communication?  and you believe that a reminder that<br/>\njudgementalism is unproductive to communication should be dismissed as<br/>\njudgemental?  i just want to get confirmation of this before i *judge* to <br/>\ndismiss<br/>\nthe validity or relevance of this thread. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour whole argument is a defense, yet you&#39;re accusing others of being <br/>\ndefensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd your characterizations of others seems judgmental.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was being sarcastic, in part, in hopes that you might see the hypocrisy of <br/>\nyour writing and so maybe we could get away from arguing about arguing.

Not everyone here would agree, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s good to remember that words have connotations.  Is a canine companion a <br/>\nsweet pet or a dirty mutt?   Is someone using persuasion or being a bully?  <br/>\nStanding by his convictions or being stubborn?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo call someone judgmental is probably in the realm of a judgmental mutt <br/>\nbiting its own tail.  (Or a discerning dog chasing logic in a circle.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo avoid this charge of &quot;judgmentalism,&quot; would one have to violate her own <br/>\nbeliefs to the point of saying there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just not as black and white as it all first seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":41558647,"authorName":"Jessica Kelly","from":"Jessica Kelly &lt;wordup@...&gt;","profile":"wordupeditor","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] :  experience, age, and judging","postDate":"1012505838","msgId":3614,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNTk5Q0VFLjYzODQ0NzZFQG1vdGhlci5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGEzYzFhOStxZ25sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":3594,"nextInTopic":3637,"prevInTime":3613,"nextInTime":3615,"topicId":3594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"you know, no matter how much experience one has, or hold old one is, one should never *judge* someone else. being judgemental (arrogant, closed-minded, etc),","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1082586228\">you know, no matter how much experience one has, or hold old one is, one<br/>\nshould never *judge* someone else. being judgemental (arrogant,<br/>\nclosed-minded, etc), using judgemental terms (right, wrong, etc), is a *huge*<br/>\nbarrier to communication, no matter how you slice it.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nJessica Kelly<br/>\nW o r d   U p<br/>\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br/>\n&quot;There would be no greater joy than to see a beautiful park<br/>\nthat our children and adults can go to and learn about the<br/>\noil and gas industry.&quot;<br/>\n  - Tony Sanchez, former Texas Parks & Wildlife Commissioner<br/>\n                [it&#39;s all about oil...]<br/>\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":83524433,"authorName":"callymom2000","from":"&quot;callymom2000&quot; &lt;scenichillhomeschool@...&gt;","profile":"callymom2000","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":":  experience, age, and judging","postDate":"1012500617","msgId":3594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEzYzFhOStxZ25sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3614,"prevInTime":3593,"nextInTime":3595,"topicId":3594,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"From:  Earth        Date:  Thu Jan 31, 2002  7:42 am ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1796238637\">From:  Earth       &lt;the_earth_witch@y...&gt; <br/>\nDate:  Thu Jan 31, 2002  7:42 am<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I know many,<br/>\nfar too many,adults who think they know it all about<br/>\n&#39;raising&#39; kids because they have had 4 that are now<br/>\nadults.
