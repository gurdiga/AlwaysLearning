I was thinking about this powerful statement; thinking about my own experience in growing up in the system, thinking about current stories I hear about how some ps kids treat one another, and really feel sad at all that is lost with that environment.  I really like to be around my kids for more reasons than I am interested in writing right now, however, I will write about one of these.  I like being around them, so that when something is said to them, or within earshot, that is contrary to my &#39;good feelings?&#39;, I am there to talk about that with them.  For example, perhaps a weird example?, my son&#39;s in baseball, and I hang around by the dugout...seems the &quot;mean coach&quot; acts a bit nicer when I&#39;m so close.  Anyway, one day one of the boys tooted...to which many of the boys were saying &quot;ooohhh, who farted?&quot;  &quot;that&#39;s bad&quot;, etc...  Well, one of the coaches was<br/>\n standing there, and looked at me with embarrassment, (I was laughing)and spoke with them, kind of laughing, trying to get serious, saying, &quot;there is a lady out here, boys, we can&#39;t act like that around lady&#39;s!&quot;  My point of the story is, that I spoke with my son about it later, about the acting around lady&#39;s...to which I don&#39;t hold those values dear to my own.    <br/>\n <br/>\nSandra wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n .<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t school specialize in removing people&#39;s will to think, and in <br/>\nneutralizing any confidence or new ideas they might&#39;ve been about to vocalize?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
