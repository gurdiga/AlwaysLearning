We re night owls here, but I am a mom that sleeps in with her kids and stays","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-358245129\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Which came first your depression or the kids migrating to a nighttime schedule? We&#39;re night owls here, but I am a mom that sleeps in with her kids and stays up, mainly because I always have stayed up late. (Husband has a flexible career and mostly works from home, so he shares our schedule.) I think we really have a delayed sleep phase disorder, so even when we try to shift our schedules for a long while i.e months, we never feel rested, are more irritable, and it just really isn&#39;t us. This really impacts our life in society. Because we can&#39;t always get to the fun stuff we&#39;d like to do, things like classes, meet-ups, museum open hours, etc or we have to alter our schedule for a while, which ends up wearing us all out. This happens every summer when kids want to go to summer day camps. And I can begin to feel guilty and sad that we miss out because of our sleep schedule. So I cannot think about what we are missing out on, instead I have to think about what we can do.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Especially if this is new to you, this time change your girls are living, and especially if it is uncomfortable for you to live in their time zone, I imagine this alone could trigger depression. Or at least aid it, since now you are having hours alone, in which you might be missing them, and then they are waking up and wanting to play minecraft, waking too late to go out and really do things, or their lack of desire. (Our girls are 6 &amp; 8, minecraft is #1 here too) Also not being able to participate in their world may also not be helping. Old mac minis can run at the low end of about $250 for the computer alone on eBay. Some Universities sell used parts, monitors, mice, etc. at very inexpensive rates. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It can be depressing to know you miss out on life because of sleep alteration. It can also get that way if you need outings, and aren&#39;t able to get them. What about walks, can you get out at least for yourself and take a walk? Then you could bring things back the girls may find interesting, meanwhile you&#39;d get a moment out and to breathe in fresh air. Also check you vitamin D levels this time of year.

I still get low, still can fall into guilty thoughts about mothering, still need feedback from friends and support. But I can self talk my way out of lows.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My ways to combat the impacts of our altered sleep is that I plan activities when I feel the best, so in your house since you can do mornings, I would look for activities when they feel best. I aim for away from home activities that begin at around 1pm, and at home activities don&#39;t usually begin until 3-5pm. By then they&#39;ve gotten some playtime in, and are ready to chop the day up a little. One of our daughters, at around 9pm, suddenly wakes up, and asks us a lot of questions and wants to make cookies, or bread, which if I was tired at 9 would be miserable for me! So I do wonder if part of their altered schedule could be negatively impacting you.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stephanie<br>\n</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] More sparkle and more perspective needed","postDate":"1392169621","msgId":73549,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBNDBGMDUxLUUwMDgtNDQyOS1BRjVBLUI4NDgwMkUwNEFCOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PHBlYzhrdGFhazFiaThsMGRnMjNqNW9qZi4xMzkxNDE3NTQxMjkyQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PHBlYzhrdGFhazFiaThsMGRnMjNqNW9qZi4xMzkxNDE3NTQxMjkyQGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73487,"nextInTopic":73552,"prevInTime":73548,"nextInTime":73550,"topicId":73405,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I even pretended I was on a how to be a fantastic mother tv show once...guess what?

I need a break&#39; for &#39;I can&#39;t wait to be with my kids today&#39;) and doing it even when I didn&#39;t feel it and with a smile. All that stuff and others changes your biochemistry.

We have been unschooling for nearly 3 years.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I have recently come through a months-long depression where I was neglectful of my kids. I was physically present and did my best to continue making small better choices, but as I am coming back to my more normal self, I can see some big problems that my limited participation created.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The first is that life is not sparkly here. It is mostly peaceful and even enjoyable most days, but it isn&#39;t sparkly and we all feel it. Adding to that, or maybe as a result of my depression, the kids (9 and 6) are in a period where they don&#39;t want to leave the house. We had one activity (open gymnastics) that we maintained each week that both girls enjoyed, but that has now been let go because the oldest says she finds it boring because she doesn&#39;t enjoy the company of the other children there.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I find my offers of trying new things rejected by the kids, usually because they don&#39;t want to go out, but also because my oldest doesn&#39;t enjoy trying new things- she is uncomfortable with uncertainty and the possibility she will not be good at something. She also gets carsick on most rides over 30 minutes, so she generally declines anything she doesn&#39;t already find significantly interesting. This can limit my ability to introduce new fun things to both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls&#39; main focus is Minecraft and skyping with other children online, which I also find very fun. I have put my energy into learning enough about servers, mods and game maps to get each their own server, and do my best to maintain them. We only have 2 computers, so I don&#39;t get to play along with them very often, but I am nearby to help, to read things, to reload the map, etc. I watch Minecraft videos with them sometimes and, although I have trouble watching more than 20 minutes (due to motion sickness), I can and do frequently watch short clips of the funny parts they want to share.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>These are some of the ways we are reconnecting as I am finding myself again and my mental health improves. But I want to go farther with bringing the sparkle back. And I am unsure how to accomplish this from inside the house.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The second challenge is that the kids are both night owls. My oldest (9) usually gets tired and goes to bed around 2am, sleeping until about noon. But my little one (6) will frequently stay up all night watching YouTube videos, kissing her dad goodbye in the morning and then heading to sleep at 6 or 7 am, to sleep most of the day. And when they are sleeping for a big part of the day, we aren&#39;t connecting and I feel neglectful and lazy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When we have actual plans, like when we were going to gymnastics, I can usually help my youngest fall asleep by midnight so she can get up (and feel pretty good) by 9:30am. But often she will argue, wanting to stay up later, when I know she wont let me wake her in the morning if she stays up too late. And this arguing takes place when I am also tired and wanting to head to bed. I frequently revert to the &quot;for your own good&quot; argument for lack of other, better tools and options, and frankly I would rather stay home than fight over going to bed. But I know there are other options, even though right now I cannot see them.</p><p><br></p><p>It occurred to me a couple of nights ago that I could transition my sleep cycle to match theirs or come a bit closer, so I am not as tired at midnight; so I can be more present and helpful when they are awake, even at night. But I am somewhat resistant to this change- I cannot yet accept it would be ok for a mom of young children to sleep until noon. Even though I can see this would be more helpful overall, I can feel my resistance and have taken only minimal action toward this goal- setting my morning alarm for 10am instead of 9 so I can sleep a little longer and stay awake and moderately functional until 2am.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I really connected to something recently posted to the Unschooling Facebook group: &quot;Unschooling is not &quot;whatever you want honey I&#39;ll be over here doing my own separate thing I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out.&quot; That would be neglect. We need to consistently be providing something better, richer, interesting, more vivid [than] they would be getting in school. It&#39;s not up our kids to ask for enrichment. It is up to us to provide it.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>That type of neglect is kind of how it feels right now at my house. And the kids&#39; sleep cycle is part of this issue. Because I am awake hours before the children, doing my own thing and then they are alone once I go to bed. I am uncomfortable with how disconnected I feel from them, even though during the hours we are awake together I am actively helping, providing food/snacks, being present. I think it is not enough time- and in part it is the idea of their ages that makes me uncomfortable. If they were teenagers with night owl schedule, I might feel differently (or not) but I am hung up on their young age and my ideas about &quot;good moms&quot; and how this sleep cycle limits our options for activities with other kids and families.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I would really like some feedback on improving my perspective and on providing vivid, inspiring, sparkly things into our environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>(As a footnote, my depression is clinical and chronic and has been under good control for more than 6 years. This was an unusual challenge and I am steadily getting back to normal.)</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73478,"nextTopicId":73593}}
