Julian has no <br/>\ndeep objections to doing things like brush his teeth, but most of the time it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t occur to him. If I say, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go brush your teeth during the <br/>\ncommercial?&quot; when we&#39;re watching tv, he&#39;ll generally just do it. He usually <br/>\ngoes to bed when we do, because he likes Beth to read to him before bed and <br/>\nif he stays up too late she&#39;ll be asleep. Sometimes he&#39;ll read for a while <br/>\nafter, or he&#39;ll just turn out the light. We don&#39;t really have assigned <br/>\n&quot;chores,&quot; but he usually does all the laundry. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe watches a lot of tv at night with us, but usually plays at the same time. <br/>\nHe plays computer games for many hours at a time sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll ask me to nudge him about writing, because the idea of writing isn&#39;t <br/>\nfun for him, but he loves having written. (Once he&#39;s started, he likes to do <br/>\nit.)<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian is twelve, and he&#39;s already six inches taller than me, and sweet and <br/>\nquite lovely. He still likes to cuddle a lot, an initiates holding my hand in <br/>\npublic, often. We&#39;ve been asked not to call him &quot;Puff&quot; or &quot;sweetie&quot; or other <br/>\nlovie names in front of friends, but definitely in private.  He&#39;s VERY <br/>\nsmart-- amazes me sometimes. He just read 1984 and had some brilliant <br/>\ninsights that I never would have thought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3833,"nextTopicId":3853}}
