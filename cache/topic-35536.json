Basically I would take almost every toy bin, and especially the <br/>\nones that were a real pain to seperate from other stuff (like <br/>\nplaymobil and puzzles) and put them in the guest bedroom and lock the <br/>\ndoor.  They weren&#39;t *off limits*, my kids knew where they were and I <br/>\ncould always get something out ... but for this particular child it <br/>\nreduced everyone&#39;s stress.

But, in my experience, he was the only child of the many, <br/>\nmany kids that have been to our house to play, who seemed to play <br/>\nthat way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of the one child whose parents don&#39;t seem to take <br/>\nresponsibility for his actions at your home, I think the park is a <br/>\ngreat solution!
