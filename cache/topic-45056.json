It s","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1585519067\">This isn&#39;t about speaking up, really, but a great tool I&#39;ve used for<br/>\nthe past couple of years is a little bottle of bubbles that I keep in<br/>\nmy purse. It&#39;s larger than those wedding bubbles, but smaller than a<br/>\n&quot;standard&quot; bottle; I guess it&#39;s 3 ounces or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m in the grocery store or Target or wherever and I see that a<br/>\nchild is having a meltdown, and either the parent isn&#39;t responding or<br/>\nis getting more and more angry, I&#39;ll get out the bubbles. I can stand<br/>\nsome distance away and blow the bubbles in their direction - kids are<br/>\nenchanted with bubbles, and it usually works to completely dismantle (?<br/>\nnot the right word) the situation. The child gets distracted and<br/>\nsometimes happy, and the parent gets a minute to breathe. I&#39;ve only had<br/>\none negative reaction in the many times I&#39;ve done this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to look hard to find a good bottle that didn&#39;t leak in my purse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this...the kids and I will start looking for a bottle tomorrow - thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;There is a microscopically thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the most gigantic idiot on earth.  So what the hell, leap.&quot; - Cynthia Heimel<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45027,"nextTopicId":44982}}
