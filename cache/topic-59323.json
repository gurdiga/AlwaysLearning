I am here for some more.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is the back story and where the fear comes from.  Austin had a kidney transplant when he was almost three years old.  His transplanted kidney is the only one he has.  His original two never formed to be much bigger than a raisin and only had minimal function.  They have both since been removed.  He has reflux from his bladder into his transplanted kidney.  A while back he was having recurrent bladder infections because he was holding.  From those infections and the tests that followed we found out that urine was flowing freely from bladder to kidney (reflux).  With the reflux into his kidney an infection in his bladder can very well end up in his kidney which could lead to a kidney infection which could lead to rejection.  About a year ago we had a procedure called deflux done where the opening from the bladder into the ureter that leads to his kidney was made smaller so that there would be less reflux.  There is less but there is still some. <br/>\n&gt;      <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here is my problem.  We moved to San Francisco and therefore got a new nephrologist (kidney doctor).  They are very clinical here.  At home we had an old, friendly cowboy type who looked at Austin&#39;s blood and urine work, gave him a physical exam and told us we were doing a great job.  When I talked to him about fears concerning food and drink he would tell me not to worry so much that he looks good inside and out.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Our new nephrologist however has got me in a tizzy.  She said his blood pressure is low and that young children who have adult kidneys in their body need higher blood pressure to ensure enough blood is pumping through the kidney.  She wanted us to buy a blood pressure monitor and record his blood pressure.   So, we bought one and recorded his blood pressure which pissed Austin off. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She also told us that based off of what we told her he is not getting enough fluids.  He gets 24 oz. at night through a pump and then during the day he probably only drinks about 12-20 oz.  I know this isn&#39;t enough.  I have always thought he didn&#39;t drink enough for someone who has a transplanted kidney but, in Texas we were told his blood and urine look great so keep up the good work.  Our new nephrologist tells me that she thinks his blood pressure is low because he is dehydrated.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She was also concerned that he only went pee about three times a day which goes back to not enough fluid which goes back to low blood pressure which goes back to higher risk for rejection.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I left this panic inducing appointment I started pushing fluid and more bath room breaks.  Now we are at a point with Austin where he is refusing to eat, drink, pee or poop.  He says if he doesn&#39;t drink he won&#39;t have to go pee, if he doesn&#39;t eat he won&#39;t need to go poop.  The poop thing is weird to me because I haven&#39;t encountered it before but, holding his pee scares the crap out of me because of the reflux into his kidney.  The longer he holds the more likely he&#39;ll get an infection. If he has to go pee he will let a little out so that it is not uncomfortable into his pants.  He used to do this when he was much younger.  I think he may be becoming impacted since he is holding his poop and not drinking.  He is having small poop accidents which is a new thing I have never dealt with before and honestly am not dealing with well.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We just had an appointment last week with the nephrologist and I told her I can&#39;t leave here in a panic again.  I told her I know my son and I know what will work best for him and that in Austin, TX he was a perfect transplant patient.  He was treated like a rock star when he walked in but, since moving here he is a dehydrated little boy with poor blood pressure who needs to pee more and all these changes need to be made. I told her that as long as his blood, urine and physical exam of his kidney looks good that I will handle the rest. <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Now that I wrote all that out it seems silly to even mention teeth brushing.  Since we started deschooling with food he has taken to eating a lot of candy and also not brushing his teeth.  I am all on board (and so is he) with using mouth rinses and such to get the sugar off his teeth but his teeth are turning so yellow they almost look orange and there is always food built up on them.  When he smiles it&#39;s hard not to notice.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now I feel like &quot;We can unschool this but not that.&quot;  Or that I let go of too much too soon and need to back track.  I am to the point where if he has not had any fluid I bolus him fluid (Use a tube and big syringe to push fluid into his g-tube which is a button in in his stomach where he can take medicine or supplemental nutrition) and if it&#39;s been longer than three hours tell him he has to stop and go pee.  It sucks.  I HATE it! He hates it but, I am at this point where I am not comfortable waiting it out and the consequences that go with that.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I was hoping that while writing this I would have some epiphanies but the only one that comes to mind is to call his doctor in Texas and ask him to look at Austin&#39;s progress notes and see what he thinks.  We have looked into other nephrologists in the area that specialize in children but the closest one is an hour away and they want blood draws once a month instead of every two months (in Texas it was every three).<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":6160802,"authorName":"ransomenote","from":"&quot;ransomenote&quot; &lt;RansomeNote@...&gt;","profile":"ransomenote","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and how to manage it with health problems","postDate":"1296854503","msgId":59461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpaHFsNytnczg5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluNDY9N3lmU3JtVTJ5WFVYLWlqNGMzZzJrZGloUF9rPXd4R3hXUEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":59417,"nextInTopic":59468,"prevInTime":59460,"nextInTime":59462,"topicId":59323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is there a support group your son could attend where he could meet and talk with other children coping with similar issues?

I want to give him that sense of autonomy back but feel so stuck in fear. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, fear can do so much damage to the trust and relationship we&#39;ve developed with our children. My youngest son developed a chronic illness a couple<br/>\nyears ago and I found how it intertwined with unschooling really interesting. I wrote about it for Natural Life (during that period when Life Learning<br/>\nwas rolled into it), the Mar/Apr 2010 issue. The magazine&#39;s tag line for the article was, &quot;Helping a child self-manage a chronic disease is a good<br/>\ntest of unschooling principles.&quot; It&#39;s on my blog now if you&#39;d like to read it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://livingjoyfully.blogspot.com/2010/05/natural-life-article.html\">http://livingjoyfully.blogspot.com/2010/05/natural-life-article.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI have approached the situation from the perspective of fully supporting him learning what he needs to know about his health; as much self-management,<br/>\nor autonomy, as *he* is interested in taking on.<br/>\n<br/>\nShifting to focus on the self-management aspect would help you guys, I think. For example, you mentioned, &quot;We have been asking him if he minds taking<br/>\na bolus and if he says sure then we give him some fluids that way.&quot; This phrasing makes the question personal - do you mind doing this for me? - such<br/>\nthat to answer the question he probably thinks about whether the act of taking a bolus would be annoying in the moment or not. If he says sure, he&#39;s<br/>\nsaying yes to you, not making a decision about his health based on the current circumstances. (If he&#39;s not interested in self-management, then you&#39;re<br/>\nmanaging the medical decisions, and there&#39;s no need to even make it a question, just figure out the when with him.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it seems he is interested in self-management so even just rephrasing the question something like &quot;You haven&#39;t had any liquids in a while, do you<br/>\nwant to take a bolus?&quot; goes a long way. (Or &quot;do you think you should take a bolus?&quot; but that might set up resistance since you guys are at odds about<br/>\nit right now and he may feel like you&#39;re testing him - that&#39;ll work once he trusts that you won&#39;t be disappointed in him if he says no.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be subtle rewording, but it sets up a totally different situation; it&#39;s sharing an observation and giving him the power of the choice. Now when<br/>\nhe thinks about an answer he&#39;s thinking about his health, his liquid intake, and deciding whether more fluids are a good idea in the moment. Now it&#39;s<br/>\nnot about you, not about your request (where you&#39;d already decided that he should take a bolus), but about his fluids. It&#39;s not personal any more (so<br/>\nless likely to erode your relationship), now it&#39;s just about the illness and how to best manage it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":440537707,"authorName":"Kirstin Eventyr","from":"Kirstin Eventyr &lt;kiventyr@...&gt;","profile":"kirventyr","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and how to manage it with health problems","postDate":"1296626318","msgId":59391,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlual9XVV82Z0g3dG9ITkpScnN4NjZFR0JjLXZNVnI0bWdhV0N6MUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDJDN0M3QUNELTVGNUMtNEQ0NS1BNDRBLUJERjAyMjgwODZGMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlpYW5hMStucDFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8MkM3QzdBQ0QtNUY1Qy00RDQ1LUE0NEEtQkRGMDIyODA4NkYxQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59388,"nextInTopic":59392,"prevInTime":59390,"nextInTime":59392,"topicId":59323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... only need blood draws and doctor s visits every three months.

I know it&#39;s  a tough one.  I want to answer some questions that were asked that might clarify a little more where we are at which might help me get to a place of relaxing. I really can&#39;t thank you guys enough for taking the time to help me with something that feels so consuming right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n=The prior doctor told you what was comforting to hear; the new doctor is telling you something different.=<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what I thought when we first moved here.  My initial thought was &quot;Were we getting inadequate care in Texas? Are they behind the times? Should I have known all these things?&quot; I stepped back from that because Dr. Berry, our doctor in Texas, has seen Austin since the day he was born and has helped us this far with support, advice and options.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was looking for a new nephrologist here and calling around the opinion I came to is there are a lot of opinions when it comes to transplant care and not one right way to do it.  For instance in Texas once you are a year out with no complications you only need blood draws and doctor&#39;s visits every three months.  When we moved here the nephrologist we choose insisted on every two months.  There was no budging from that.  So, I called the doctor that is an hour away and they insisted on blood draws every month but were willing to go every couple months on the doctor&#39;s visit.  At the time Austin wanted the doctor with the least amount of blood drawls.  Actually he wants a doctor who will let him do what he did in Texas but none so far are willing to go out as far as three months.  To me it seems each doctor has a way they like to do things that they insist is the right way but how can that be when each doctor has a different way to do things?  It&#39;s maddening.  Maybe I should revisit the idea of trying another doctor even if it means more blood draws with Austin.<br/>\n<br/>\n=What about doing some research on the subject=<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet is a scary place when it comes to medical research on your child, but I have.  It&#39;s been a while.  I stopped because it just created more fear.  I never found anything that didn&#39;t raise my fear or that was in terms I could understand.  Or maybe I did find useful information but after sifting through all the stuff that scared the crap out of me I didn&#39;t get much out of the stuff that would help me.  It&#39;s worth a shot again.  <br/>\n<br/>\n=How does the system work? How does the transplant change the normal function? What does it need and what gets in the way of it functioning well? (Undoubtedly there are videos on line about kidneys. But do it in an information seeking, empowering way, not as a way to convince him the doctor&#39;s right. Let him know you want to look into the options together and this will help the two of you ask better questions.)=<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an adult once the kidney is transplanted it works just like any other kidney.  You need to take meds to keep the immune system down so it doesn&#39;t catch on that there is an intruder in the mix.  In a child it needs more fluid to keep the blood pressure up to keep more blood pushing through it.  If it doesn&#39;t well then, it just doesn&#39;t last as long.  A transplanted kidney can last from 10-20 years depending on how well you care for it.  If it weren&#39;t for the reflux I don&#39;t think I would have this fear of infection.  A bladder infection would be contained to the bladder.  In Austin it&#39;s not.  The urine moves back into his kidney.  He&#39;s on a low dose antibiotic right now to help prevent that from happening.  The fear of it happening for me is still there.  He had a lot of them back to back which is how we found out about the reflux.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do really love the idea of finding a video on how the kidney works for me though.  That seems like something I can look into without creating more fear.  If Austin is interested I will show him.  He is really resentful right now about having this thing about him that is different. He was talking about it today when we went to get his blood drawn with me and the lady sitting next to me laughed and rolled her eyes.  Like he was being ridiculous.  I wanted to punch her in the face.  <br/>\n<br/>\n=I&#39;ve seen the &quot;won&#39;t need to poop&quot; thing.=<br/>\n<br/>\nOh thank God!  That makes me feel so much better!  Seriously :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n=I recommend popsicles. Frozen juice things. Liquidy, water foods. Lettuce. Celery. Apples.=<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are still deschooling food and unfortunately I think I have set us back in my panic mode.  He really is only interested in things like chips, cheese and snickers.    We have been asking him if he minds taking a bolus (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ehow.com/about_5751859_bolus-feeding-guidelines.html)\">http://www.ehow.com/about_5751859_bolus-feeding-guidelines.html)</a> and if he says sure then we give him some fluids that way.  Mostly apple juice and prune juice to try to help things move along down there.  (I just got up and gave him a popsicle though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAustin quit breastfeeding when he was 9 months old.  When we started bottle feeding we found out he was only taking in about 3-5 oz. total for the day.  At 1 year old we placed a G-tube (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-gastric-feeding-tube.htm)\">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-gastric-feeding-tube.htm)</a> for nutrition. His kidneys were failing and his body was toxic.  He was strictly fed with G-tube only until he had his transplant when he was almost three.  From the time he was born until he was four maybe he vomited a lot because of the enteral feedings.  His body could only process small amounts of food at a time and what we found out later was that three onces would go in and his body was only processing one before the next three started to go in and at some point there just wasn&#39;t any more room for more food and he would vomit.  Once he had the transplant we started on feeding therapy since he missed that time when kids naturally learn to eat. I really wish we would have skipped over this whole part and just figured it out on our own.  It could have been a really fun time trying new foods together in the safety of our home because feeding therapy has a lot to do with control.  And as he got older the more control was taken away from him.  He has HUGE issues with food.  Understandably.  So, although I put other stuff on his monkey platter like fruits and such he doesn&#39;t eat them.  They are still scary and crackers and cheese are safe.  I never pushed a cracker on him but an apple? That is a different story.  He&#39;ll ask for them sometimes which is awesome but won&#39;t actually eat them. <br/>\n <br/>\nThe deschooling phase does make some of this harder.  He has felt what autonomy feels like and he wants more!  He loves it! Right now I&#39;ve made everything a big, jumbled up mess by back tracking and panicking.  I want to give him that sense of autonomy back but feel so stuck in fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Talking to the doctor in Texas is a good idea=<br/>\n<br/>\nI called him yesterday and am waiting for a phone call back.  I was also offered by a fellow unschooler in the area who is a doctor to find out if she can find a children&#39;s nephrologist to talk to.  I would love to change doctors here but I am afraid we wouldn&#39;t be covered.  I will call my insurance though and see how far out of the city I can go and still be covered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra replied =But she based it off what you told her. And HOW do you &quot;know&quot; it isn&#39;t enough? Is his urine sludgy?= to a statement about Austin not getting enough fluid, and the doctor saying he was dehydrated.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know from his urine sample that day he was dehydrated.  She said it was concentrated which meant he was dehydrated.  I guess I can start paying closer attention to what it looks like at home (he doesn&#39;t flush his pee so I wouldn&#39;t even need to say anything about it which is a plus).<br/>\n<br/>\n=Because I have the pleasure of knowing Austin I can see his is a healthy young man who is determined to embrace the changes your family is making. And he is determined to keep you accountable.=<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day when we were over at her (Shannon)house and Austin raved about what an awesome mom I have become and how he used to want to flush me down the toilet but now doesn&#39;t want to do that. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n= Have you told him from a loving place that you are generally worried about his health?=<br/>\n<br/>\nI have told him about my concerns outside of when my concerns are really high.  Lately he listens to me and then walks out of the room without saying a word. I don&#39;t know if that is a good thing or a bad thing. But he&#39;s glaring at me so I am going to say it&#39;s more bad than good.  The last conversation we had he said &quot;I hate that I have to pee and poop because of my kidney.&quot; I said that those things are things ALL humans have to do whether they have a transplanted kidney or not.&quot;  Then I went into input and output.  Humans need three things to live.  Food, water and air.  We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.  We take in fluid and process out urine.  We take in food and process out poop.  Too much?<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember a couple months ago I asked Austin, &quot;How can I love you better?&quot;  Without hesitation he answered &quot;Get rid of your fear!&quot; I need to stick that up somewhere.  I know my worry only brings out resistance and erodes trust.  It makes him feel like I think he is too stupid to know when to pee, eat, poop or drink.<br/>\n<br/>\n=Perhaps you could challenge yourself to spend five days without mentioning his urine or bowel movements see what happens on its own.=<br/>\n<br/>\nI know through conversations here (and at Shannon&#39;s house and with the unschoolers here) I have worked through fear.  Right now on the question of can I challenge myself to five days? I would say maybe.  Maybe a smaller goal though.  Maybe one day.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, like I just said I am a bundle of nerves and fear.  We were in this great place and now Austin is just pissed at me.  And I&#39;m pissed at myself because I just can&#39;t seem to shake this feeling.

Which means he is healthy. I would<br/>\nimagine it is so easy to get consumed by the what ifs and forget to see<br/>\nwhat is.<br/>\nI am not a parent with a child who has a chronic illness .. I do know<br/>\nthat as a parent when my children get sick I often switch gears and<br/>\nbecome a completely different parent (I wrote a bit about that here<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imnotgoingtoholdbacknomore.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-sickness-and-&#92;\">http://imnotgoingtoholdbacknomore.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-sickness-and-&#92;</a><br/>\nin-health.html&gt;  ) I wonder if it would be useful to remind yourself<br/>\nthat Austin needs you to be the mom he needs ALL the time, with our<br/>\nwithout body in or out put.<br/>\nBecause I have the pleasure of knowing Austin I can see his is a healthy<br/>\nyoung man who is determined to embrace the changes your family is<br/>\nmaking. And he is determined to keep you accountable.  Have you told him<br/>\nfrom a loving place that you are generally worried about his health?<br/>\nHave you told him that you really do trust him to manage the in and out<br/>\nputs of his body? Perhaps you could challenge yourself to spend five<br/>\ndays without mentioning his urine or bowel movements see what happens on<br/>\nits own.<br/>\nIt is hard as the parent to watch with all the worry we bring to a<br/>\nsituation. However, Austin does not have any of that. He is just a kid<br/>\nwho wants to be in the world in a way that he has some control over. He<br/>\nis enjoying this new freedom to its fullest right now and he wants to be<br/>\nhappy and have fun. Holding on to your urine and bowels will stop being<br/>\ncomfortable and I would imagine will lead him to look for some relief . <br/>\nWhen he asks for help offer it up with an open heart (and try not to<br/>\nrush in with any of the fear or I knew this would happen kind of stuff<br/>\nthat I know I takes me HUGE efforts to hold back from my own children).<br/>\nOn the topic of hydration I wonder if he would enjoy making up and<br/>\ntesting some of his own recipes .. a few quick searches on line and you<br/>\ncould together take on making homemade sodas, smoothies, floats,<br/>\nmilkshakes to mention a few .. Oh and slushes .. and snow cones .. and<br/>\nand and ..<br/>\nThis is offered from a parent who children&#39;s health concerns are no<br/>\nwhere near as deep as this .. though I have seen them manage their own<br/>\ndietary needs to the point of noticing those foods and situations that<br/>\nmake them not feel good and those that do. It is tough to find a doctor<br/>\nwho knows Austin as well as you do so perhaps believing Austin and you<br/>\nare the experts and the doctors are the outside resources might be<br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\nI think the suggestions offered so far of doing your own research<br/>\ntogether will also help to debunk some of the ideas and to empower you<br/>\nboth to really understand the situation and bring that info. with you to<br/>\neach of your appointments.<br/>\nShannon<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hmbpie&quot; &lt;heatherpie@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I have been de-schooling Austin (9 years old) since September and have<br/>\ngotten incredibly brilliant advice here since I started.  I am here for<br/>\nsome more.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is the back story and where the fear comes from.  Austin had a<br/>\nkidney transplant when he was almost three years old.  His transplanted<br/>\nkidney is the only one he has.  His original two never formed to be much<br/>\nbigger than a raisin and only had minimal function.  They have both<br/>\nsince been removed.  He has reflux from his bladder into his<br/>\ntransplanted kidney.  A while back he was having recurrent bladder<br/>\ninfections because he was holding.  From those infections and the tests<br/>\nthat followed we found out that urine was flowing freely from bladder to<br/>\nkidney (reflux).  With the reflux into his kidney an infection in his<br/>\nbladder can very well end up in his kidney which could lead to a kidney<br/>\ninfection which could lead to rejection.  About a year ago we had a<br/>\nprocedure called deflux done where the opening from the bladder into the<br/>\nureter that leads to his kidney was made smaller so that there would be<br/>\nless reflux.  There is less but there is still some.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Here is my problem.  We moved to San Francisco and therefore got a new<br/>\nnephrologist (kidney doctor).  They are very clinical here.  At home we<br/>\nhad an old, friendly cowboy type who looked at Austin&#39;s blood and urine<br/>\nwork, gave him a physical exam and told us we were doing a great job. <br/>\nWhen I talked to him about fears concerning food and drink he would tell<br/>\nme not to worry so much that he looks good inside and out.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our new nephrologist however has got me in a tizzy.  She said his<br/>\nblood pressure is low and that young children who have adult kidneys in<br/>\ntheir body need higher blood pressure to ensure enough blood is pumping<br/>\nthrough the kidney.  She wanted us to buy a blood pressure monitor and<br/>\nrecord his blood pressure.   So, we bought one and recorded his blood<br/>\npressure which pissed Austin off.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She also told us that based off of what we told her he is not getting<br/>\nenough fluids.  He gets 24 oz. at night through a pump and then during<br/>\nthe day he probably only drinks about 12-20 oz.  I know this isn&#39;t<br/>\nenough.  I have always thought he didn&#39;t drink enough for someone who<br/>\nhas a transplanted kidney but, in Texas we were told his blood and urine<br/>\nlook great so keep up the good work.  Our new nephrologist tells me that<br/>\nshe thinks his blood pressure is low because he is dehydrated.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She was also concerned that he only went pee about three times a day<br/>\nwhich goes back to not enough fluid which goes back to low blood<br/>\npressure which goes back to higher risk for rejection.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; When I left this panic inducing appointment I started pushing fluid<br/>\nand more bath room breaks.  Now we are at a point with Austin where he<br/>\nis refusing to eat, drink, pee or poop.  He says if he doesn&#39;t drink he<br/>\nwon&#39;t have to go pee, if he doesn&#39;t eat he won&#39;t need to go poop.  The<br/>\npoop thing is weird to me because I haven&#39;t encountered it before but,<br/>\nholding his pee scares the crap out of me because of the reflux into his<br/>\nkidney.  The longer he holds the more likely he&#39;ll get an infection. If<br/>\nhe has to go pee he will let a little out so that it is not<br/>\nuncomfortable into his pants.  He used to do this when he was much<br/>\nyounger.  I think he may be becoming impacted since he is holding his<br/>\npoop and not drinking.  He is having small poop accidents which is a new<br/>\nthing I have never dealt with before and honestly am not dealing with<br/>\nwell.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; We just had an appointment last week with the nephrologist and I told<br/>\nher I can&#39;t leave here in a panic again.  I told her I know my son and I<br/>\nknow what will work best for him and that in Austin, TX he was a perfect<br/>\ntransplant patient.  He was treated like a rock star when he walked in<br/>\nbut, since moving here he is a dehydrated little boy with poor blood<br/>\npressure who needs to pee more and all these changes need to be made. I<br/>\ntold her that as long as his blood, urine and physical exam of his<br/>\nkidney looks good that I will handle the rest.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Now that I wrote all that out it seems silly to even mention teeth<br/>\nbrushing.  Since we started deschooling with food he has taken to eating<br/>\na lot of candy and also not brushing his teeth.  I am all on board (and<br/>\nso is he) with using mouth rinses and such to get the sugar off his<br/>\nteeth but his teeth are turning so yellow they almost look orange and<br/>\nthere is always food built up on them.  When he smiles it&#39;s hard not to<br/>\nnotice.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Right now I feel like &quot;We can unschool this but not that.&quot;  Or that I<br/>\nlet go of too much too soon and need to back track.  I am to the point<br/>\nwhere if he has not had any fluid I bolus him fluid (Use a tube and big<br/>\nsyringe to push fluid into his g-tube which is a button in in his<br/>\nstomach where he can take medicine or supplemental nutrition) and if<br/>\nit&#39;s been longer than three hours tell him he has to stop and go pee. <br/>\nIt sucks.  I HATE it! He hates it but, I am at this point where I am not<br/>\ncomfortable waiting it out and the consequences that go with that.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I was hoping that while writing this I would have some epiphanies but<br/>\nthe only one that comes to mind is to call his doctor in Texas and ask<br/>\nhim to look at Austin&#39;s progress notes and see what he thinks.  We have<br/>\nlooked into other nephrologists in the area that specialize in children<br/>\nbut the closest one is an hour away and they want blood draws once a<br/>\nmonth instead of every two months (in Texas it was every three).<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and how to manage it with health problems","postDate":"1296497248","msgId":59339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwRkQ2NjM2LUVBRDAtNEU3Mi05ODQyLTE1NkQzRTk4OEEzMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9b09iakpWQitOaWREVTlMUlE2c2JESC1EbTF1dTlqZHZPN2JZWEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlpNWlyNytlc2FjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8aWk1dmV1K2c3ZWhAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxBQU5Ma1RpPW9PYmpKVkIrTmlkRFU5TFJRNnNiREgtRG0xdXU5amR2TzdiWVhAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59335,"nextInTopic":59369,"prevInTime":59338,"nextInTime":59340,"topicId":59323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I would be afraid too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen the &quot;won&#39;t need to poop&quot; thing.  I&#39;ve heard of it in others, but Kirby was that way when he was six or seven.  He said one day he wished there had never been such a thing as poop.  He held it for days sometimes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend popsicles.  Frozen juice things.  Liquidy, water foods.  Lettuce.  Celery. Apples.  Don&#39;t talk about it, just have them there.  There&#39;s tangerine juice at Trader Joe&#39;s (you&#39;re in California, so I mention it).  <br/>\n<br/>\nTalking to the doctor in Texas is a good idea.  You could ask for a consult, offer to pay to talk to him and get him to look at the papers, and he probably won&#39;t charge you, but he might be quicker to pay attention, and closer attention, if you approach it as a request for a long-distance appointment, rather than &quot;If you could do us a favor.&quot;  Maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- She wanted us to buy a blood pressure monitor and record his blood pressure. So, we bought one and recorded his blood pressure which pissed Austin off. <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCould you record everyone&#39;s blood pressure to keep it from being irritating?  Maybe test your own under different circumstances (calm, or after climbing stairs fast or whatever) and see if he&#39;s interested in that?  Maybe when you talk to the doctor in Texas, ask for some blood pressure readings from the past, and make a chart.  I don&#39;t know...  I&#39;m just fishing for ways to keep it from being a think to be pissed off about.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-She also told us that based off of what we told her he is not getting enough fluids. He gets 24 oz. at night through a pump and then during the day he probably only drinks about 12-20 oz. I know this isn&#39;t enough. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBut she based it off what you told her.  And HOW do you &quot;know&quot; it isn&#39;t enough?  Is his urine sludgy?<br/>\n<br/>\nWatermelon.  Maybe instead of measuring ounces, find things that don&#39;t seem at ALL like &quot;drinking enough&quot; but that will help hydrate him.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I started pushing fluid and more bath room breaks.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nInterrupting movies and games to tell him to go to the bathroom?  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Now that I wrote all that out it seems silly to even mention teeth brushing. Since we started deschooling with food he has taken to eating a lot of candy and also not brushing his teeth. I am all on board (and so is he) with using mouth rinses and such to get the sugar off his teeth but his teeth are turning so yellow they almost look orange and there is always food built up on them. When he smiles it&#39;s hard not to notice. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to him about taking better care of his teeth.   Maybe you could say that never is as bad as &quot;have to.&quot;  That you&#39;re not going to tell him exactly when and how to brush his teeth, but sometime, somewhere, he needs to do that more.   Kirby, when he was a teen, started keeping a toothbrush in the shower, and would brush his teeth in there.  I don&#39;t think he was using toothpaste, just the shower water and the steam.  He brushed otherwise other times, but the shower seemed to be the primary, as far as I could tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and how to manage it with health problems","postDate":"1296466206","msgId":59329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpNXZldStnN2VoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlpNWlyNytlc2FjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59327,"nextInTopic":59333,"prevInTime":59328,"nextInTime":59330,"topicId":59323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===I have always thought he didn t drink enough for someone who has a transplanted kidney but, in Texas we were told his blood and urine look great so keep up","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-207887620\">===I have always thought he didn&#39;t drink enough for someone who has a transplanted kidney but, in Texas we were told his blood and urine look great so keep up the good work.

The poop thing is weird to me because I haven&#39;t encountered it before but, holding his pee scares the crap out of me because of the reflux into his kidney.  The longer he holds the more likely he&#39;ll get an infection. If he has to go pee he will let a little out so that it is not uncomfortable into his pants.  He used to do this when he was much younger.  I think he may be becoming impacted since he is holding his poop and not drinking.  He is having small poop accidents which is a new thing I have never dealt with before and honestly am not dealing with well.===<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like he&#39;s trying to take back some control over his own body.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive him some personal space, some breathing room. Your concern for his health is understandable and I don&#39;t want to minimize that concern at all, but a 9 year old boy who is capable of peeing and pooping without assistance should be given the space to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes his urine level have to be recorded every single time he pees? If not, let him pee in the shower, or on a tree in the backyard. Take away the clinicalness of it and let it be fun. If it does need to be recorded, think outside the box of ways to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he wants privacy, give him privacy. Just because he&#39;s a child doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not invasive to him to have someone monitoring him the way he&#39;s being monitored. Some of that may be necessary, but there must be ways to help the necessary be less invasive. Definitely ask his opinion, ask for his suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarm baths can sometimes encourage a child to relax enough to poop. If he like taking baths, he might be comfortable taking some long baths, where you or he rewarms the water as needed. I wouldn&#39;t, however, approach it from the stance of &quot;take a warm bath and maybe you&#39;ll poop&quot;, not with a 9 yr old.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that you&#39;ll have to relax considerably, and be consistent about it and patient about it, before he&#39;ll quit feeling like he needs to control eating, drinking, peeing, and pooping. Maybe it would help to talk with other parents of kidney-transplant kiddos, to find out how they&#39;ve stepped away from and/or cope with their fears.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and how to manage it with health problems","postDate":"1296463595","msgId":59327,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlpNXN0YitzMTk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGlpNWlyNytlc2FjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59323,"nextInTopic":59329,"prevInTime":59326,"nextInTime":59328,"topicId":59323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===his teeth are turning so yellow they almost look orange and there is always food built up on them.

Here","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1351680031\">I have been de-schooling Austin (9 years old) since September and have gotten incredibly brilliant advice here since I started.  I am here for some more.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the back story and where the fear comes from.  Austin had a kidney transplant when he was almost three years old.  His transplanted kidney is the only one he has.  His original two never formed to be much bigger than a raisin and only had minimal function.  They have both since been removed.  He has reflux from his bladder into his transplanted kidney.  A while back he was having recurrent bladder infections because he was holding.  From those infections and the tests that followed we found out that urine was flowing freely from bladder to kidney (reflux).  With the reflux into his kidney an infection in his bladder can very well end up in his kidney which could lead to a kidney infection which could lead to rejection.  About a year ago we had a procedure called deflux done where the opening from the bladder into the ureter that leads to his kidney was made smaller so that there would be less reflux.  There is less but there is still some. <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my problem.  We moved to San Francisco and therefore got a new nephrologist (kidney doctor).  They are very clinical here.  At home we had an old, friendly cowboy type who looked at Austin&#39;s blood and urine work, gave him a physical exam and told us we were doing a great job.  When I talked to him about fears concerning food and drink he would tell me not to worry so much that he looks good inside and out.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOur new nephrologist however has got me in a tizzy.  She said his blood pressure is low and that young children who have adult kidneys in their body need higher blood pressure to ensure enough blood is pumping through the kidney.  She wanted us to buy a blood pressure monitor and record his blood pressure.   So, we bought one and recorded his blood pressure which pissed Austin off. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also told us that based off of what we told her he is not getting enough fluids.  He gets 24 oz. at night through a pump and then during the day he probably only drinks about 12-20 oz.  I know this isn&#39;t enough.  I have always thought he didn&#39;t drink enough for someone who has a transplanted kidney but, in Texas we were told his blood and urine look great so keep up the good work.  Our new nephrologist tells me that she thinks his blood pressure is low because he is dehydrated.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was also concerned that he only went pee about three times a day which goes back to not enough fluid which goes back to low blood pressure which goes back to higher risk for rejection.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I left this panic inducing appointment I started pushing fluid and more bath room breaks.  Now we are at a point with Austin where he is refusing to eat, drink, pee or poop.  He says if he doesn&#39;t drink he won&#39;t have to go pee, if he doesn&#39;t eat he won&#39;t need to go poop.  The poop thing is weird to me because I haven&#39;t encountered it before but, holding his pee scares the crap out of me because of the reflux into his kidney.  The longer he holds the more likely he&#39;ll get an infection. If he has to go pee he will let a little out so that it is not uncomfortable into his pants.  He used to do this when he was much younger.  I think he may be becoming impacted since he is holding his poop and not drinking.  He is having small poop accidents which is a new thing I have never dealt with before and honestly am not dealing with well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe just had an appointment last week with the nephrologist and I told her I can&#39;t leave here in a panic again.  I told her I know my son and I know what will work best for him and that in Austin, TX he was a perfect transplant patient.  He was treated like a rock star when he walked in but, since moving here he is a dehydrated little boy with poor blood pressure who needs to pee more and all these changes need to be made. I told her that as long as his blood, urine and physical exam of his kidney looks good that I will handle the rest. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I wrote all that out it seems silly to even mention teeth brushing.  Since we started deschooling with food he has taken to eating a lot of candy and also not brushing his teeth.  I am all on board (and so is he) with using mouth rinses and such to get the sugar off his teeth but his teeth are turning so yellow they almost look orange and there is always food built up on them.  When he smiles it&#39;s hard not to notice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I feel like &quot;We can unschool this but not that.&quot;  Or that I let go of too much too soon and need to back track.  I am to the point where if he has not had any fluid I bolus him fluid (Use a tube and big syringe to push fluid into his g-tube which is a button in in his stomach where he can take medicine or supplemental nutrition) and if it&#39;s been longer than three hours tell him he has to stop and go pee.  It sucks.  I HATE it! He hates it but, I am at this point where I am not comfortable waiting it out and the consequences that go with that.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping that while writing this I would have some epiphanies but the only one that comes to mind is to call his doctor in Texas and ask him to look at Austin&#39;s progress notes and see what he thinks.  We have looked into other nephrologists in the area that specialize in children but the closest one is an hour away and they want blood draws once a month instead of every two months (in Texas it was every three).</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58949,"nextTopicId":59258}}
