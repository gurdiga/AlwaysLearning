If pressed about what he learns about, he will sometimes say he likes computers, art and word games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf pressed farther than that, we may elaborate, or we may give awkward pauses and incredulous looks. It&#39;s rude of other people to interrogate us about our family choices extensively and unsolicitedly and we both find it inexplicable, as neither of us would do that to anyone else. It&#39;s just weird and invasive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if anyone is rude/ignorant enough to say &quot;Isn&#39;t that illegal?&quot; Like actually accusing me to my face of being a negligent criminal? Seriously? What kind of response is anyone looking for from that? We just say &quot;Uh, no?&quot; with further incredulous/disinterested looks. This rarely happens anymore though, since most people know someone who is a homeschooler.  And if they don&#39;t, that&#39;s what Google is there for.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people seem positively curious (&quot;Oh, neat! How does that work?! I&#39;ve heard about that! Tell me more?&quot;) I will point them to resources and maybe engage in dialogue as I feel like doing on that day, but the reality is, it&#39;s no one&#39;s obligation to justify their choices to anyone they don&#39;t want to.
