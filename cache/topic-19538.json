Learning is experiential and this is why I have chosen to homeschool.  Alexander is not a container.  He is a beautiful human being.  I think cultivating seeds and providing the opportunity for growth to happen is more attune to my philosophy.  He is not an empty box.  He came into this world with eyes wide open and ready to explore and discover.  Where he goes I follow.  He is a teacher to me.  I am a facilitator and do my best to feed his desire to learn.  <br/>\nMy .02, for what it is worth.<br/>\nKay<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: moonwindstarsky <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Saturday, May 08, 2004 6:28 AM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] poster at school<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Free Knowledge<br/>\n<br/>\n  Bring Your Own Container&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n  it reminds me of what my mom said, &quot;you don&#39;t have to figure <br/>\n  anything out, [just do what they tell you] get A&#39;s, and knowledge <br/>\n  should be pounded into your head - it&#39;s the only way you&#39;ll remember <br/>\n  something&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
