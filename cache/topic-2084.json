I asked him what <br/>\nhe thought about the people who posed on those internet sex sites he likes <br/>\nto look at, whether he thought they enjoyed what they were doing.  He <br/>\nlooked straight at me and said he didn&#39;t go to those sites.  I asked who <br/>\ndid, because I know *someone* did on December 14.  He said he didn&#39;t <br/>\nknow.  (Before anyone suggests maybe it was dh, let it be known that dh is <br/>\nthe original technophobe.  He never touches the computer, wouldn&#39;t know how <br/>\nto get online, doesn&#39;t even want to learn how to play a CD on it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI just let the lie go and continued on with what *I* wanted to say about <br/>\nthe people, that they likely didn&#39;t enjoy what they were doing, that they <br/>\nmight be desperate for money, though it doesn&#39;t pay much, that they might <br/>\nhave been drugged or even kidnapped, that the pop stars probably had <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s body pasted onto their heads, that kind of thing.  I got no <br/>\nreaction, but at least I had my say.  Have I mentioned that my son is *not* <br/>\na talker?  %^)<br/>\n<br/>\nI was disappointed about the lying.  We&#39;ve had a lot of trouble with it <br/>\nover the years, even though there are no harsh punishments he might need to <br/>\nlie to avoid.  WHen he was little, he used to tell me he hadn&#39;t done <br/>\nsomething even when I had watched him do the thing and he *knew* I had <br/>\nwatched him do it.  I kind of thought we were over that by now, but I guess <br/>\nnot.  The other night the phone rang quite late and woke me up.  It was a <br/>\nfax machine or something.  Lars was still up, and the door to the computer <br/>\nroom was almost closed, something he usually doesn&#39;t do.  I went towards <br/>\nthe room to have a peek in, which I often do when he&#39;s in there.  He shut <br/>\nthe door further.  I asked casually what he was working on, and he said he <br/>\nwas downloading stuff.  I decided not to call him on the fact that the <br/>\nphone wouldn&#39;t have rung if he had really been online.  My take is that it <br/>\nwas a spur of the moment lie.  (Maybe my original approach to the porn last <br/>\nyear was too heavy.  Maybe he figures he&#39;s going to get into a lot of <br/>\ntrouble if he admits it.  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRod is going to talk with him, maybe find him some pictures to look <br/>\nat.

(AP) - During a seminar on computer software designed to <br/>\nmonitor children&#39;s Internet use and protect them from sexual predators, Don <br/>\nSpurlin wondered if the product couldn&#39;t be turned around to monitor the <br/>\npredators themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpurlin, a probation officer with a caseload full of sex offenders, contacted <br/>\nthe maker of ``Cyber Sentinel.&#39;&#39; Security Software Systems had never <br/>\nconsidered using the software for law enforcement, but welcomed the idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow tests of the program have worked so well that Spurlin&#39;s Sangamon County <br/>\nplans to require the software for computer-using offenders on probation. <br/>\n<br/>\n``We&#39;re protecting children by preventing the offenders that we know about <br/>\nfrom being able to do the things that they&#39;d like to do,&#39;&#39; Spurlin said. <br/>\n<br/>\nCyber Sentinel was developed to record sexually explicit references in <br/>\nchildren&#39;s chat room conversations, instant messages, e-mail messages and <br/>\nimage exchanges so parents can see what their children are doing online, said <br/>\nDan Jude, president of Sugar Grove-based Security Software. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe program uses a library of offensive and explicit words developed with law <br/>\nenforcement agencies, and includes phrases used by offenders, such as ``Do <br/>\nyour parents use this computer?&#39;&#39; or ``Do you like older men?&#39;&#39; It can be <br/>\ncustomized to spot personal information, such as the child&#39;s school name, <br/>\nphone number and address. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe software was tested on four Sangamon County sex offenders who have <br/>\ncomputers. If they go to a prohibited Web site, use sexually explicit <br/>\nlanguage or use phrases common to online predators, Spurlin gets an e-mail <br/>\nletting him know their probation conditions may have been violated. <br/>\n<br/>\n``At first, I thought that this is taking everything away from my privacy,&#39;&#39; <br/>\nsaid Jim McIntire, 33, of Springfield, who has been on probation for six <br/>\nyears for criminal sexual abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\n``The more I thought about it, the more I realized they&#39;ve got a tight rein <br/>\non me. With this, at least they know I&#39;m on the computer and I&#39;m not out <br/>\ndoing something different.&#39;&#39; <br/>\n<br/>\nOther probation offices across the country are using similar programs, said <br/>\nCarl Wicklund, executive director of the American Parole and Probation <br/>\nAssociation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have obvious benefits but must not replace human contact, Wicklund said. <br/>\n<br/>\n``If you&#39;re too reliant on any technology, the facts may hide the truth,&#39;&#39; he <br/>\nsaid. <br/>\n<br/>\nAuthorities can customize the list of words or phrases that generate an <br/>\ne-mail alert, Jude said. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn McIntire&#39;s case, his computer activity produced nearly 100 alerts in just <br/>\none week. It turned out just to be offensive language McIntire was using <br/>\nwhile playing online card games, so Spurlin removed some of the words from <br/>\nhis Sentinel library. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe American Civil Liberties Union recognizes that people on probation have <br/>\nfewer rights than other citizens, but wants to make sure authorities don&#39;t go <br/>\noverboard with the software. <br/>\n<br/>\n``It&#39;s reasonable for people to want to read articles and even look at <br/>\npictures that have references to sexuality that don&#39;t raise concerns about <br/>\nfuture sex offenses,&#39;&#39; ACLU attorney Benjamin Wolf said. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecurity Software has given Sangamon County 100 copies of the $35 program. <br/>\n<br/>\nCounty Adult Probation Director Michael Torchia has gotten judicial approval <br/>\nto change the probation code to require that future sex offenders on <br/>\nprobation who have computers use the software.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2105406,"authorName":"sharonve@aol.com","from":"sharonve@...","profile":"sharonve","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teenage Boys etc.","postDate":"1010260456","msgId":2168,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDllLjIwMWZjM2FmLjI5NjhiM2U4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":2165,"nextInTopic":2170,"prevInTime":2167,"nextInTime":2169,"topicId":2084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 1/5/02 2:04:09 PM, leschke@islandnet.com writes: So maybe the teen will grow up to be an Ivy League scientist who studies ...

We<br/>\nneed<br/>\n&gt; to figure out how people get in trouble with it,&quot; said Dr. Al Cooper of<br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre, who conducted the survey in<br/>\n&gt; conjunction with MSNBC.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cooper, who has conducted a series of surveys probing the growing world of<br/>\n&gt; Internet sex, said his latest study was aimed at identifying those at risk<br/>\n&gt; for cybersex addiction.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Culling through some 40,000 responses to a poll posted at the MSNBC site,<br/>\n&gt; Cooper examined a random sample of some 7,000 male respondents and further<br/>\n&gt; narrowed the group down to 384 who indicated they had problems with online<br/>\n&gt; sexual activity.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; These respondents reported that they engaged in cybersex for an average of<br/>\n&gt; about 5.7 hours per week, or twice as much time as the rest of the sample.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Spending more hours trolling the Internet&#39;s porn sites and sex chat rooms<br/>\n&gt; was only one signifier of online sexual compulsion, Cooper said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Most of those who reported cybersex addiction said they went online to<br/>\n&gt; relieve stress, rather than for entertainment or sex information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;People do it again and again and again, instead of running or talking to<br/>\n&gt; their partner,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;There are alternate ways of relieving stress<br/>\n&gt; that are probably healthier.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; They also said they spent time engaging in cybersexual activities that<br/>\nthey<br/>\n&gt; would never attempt in real life.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;These people go online to do things, whether it&#39;s with animals or<br/>\n&gt; threesomes or homosexual or whatever -- that they wouldn&#39;t do in their<br/>\n&gt; offline life,&quot; Cooper said.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;This tends to reinforce a split between their online and offline life,&quot;<br/>\nhe<br/>\n&gt; said. &quot;The Internet can be good in the sense that you can experiment and<br/>\n&gt; check it out, but if you never resolve it offline, it creates a fantasy<br/>\nlife<br/>\n&gt; that the research finds to be problematic.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cooper said that most of those respondents who reported signs of cybersex<br/>\n&gt; compulsion also reported reduced real time sexual activity with an offline<br/>\n&gt; partner -- further alienating their real and fantasy sex lives.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some experts have questioned the validity of Cooper&#39;s findings, noting<br/>\nthat<br/>\n&gt; the self-selecting nature of the respondents meant it was not as<br/>\n&gt; scientifically useful as a true, random poll.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Editors at MSNBC have said they posted the survey because they found it<br/>\n&gt; interesting, not to obtain hard scientific results.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; But Cooper, a psychologist who teaches at Stanford University, said the<br/>\n&gt; fledgling field of online sexuality studies required new methods of<br/>\n&gt; gathering data and that Internet polls could reach a much larger and more<br/>\n&gt; diverse group than traditional surveys.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Cooper said the next survey, due out in several months, would take a<br/>\nbroader<br/>\n&gt; look at cybersex compulsion and would include data from women --<br/>\n&gt; statistically believed to have a lower rate of &quot;cyber-addiction&quot; than men.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Recent statistics show that between December 1999 and February 2001, the<br/>\n&gt; number of individual visitors to sexual sites grew by more than 27<br/>\npercent,<br/>\n&gt; to nearly 28 million from 22 million. Over the same period, retail sites<br/>\n&gt; showed growth at less than half that rate.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;What we would expect over time is that there is going to be an increase,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; he said. &quot;Some people convert to problematic Internet usage, and the real<br/>\n&gt; problem then is that they don&#39;t seem to be able to find their way out of<br/>\n&gt; it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Copyright 2002 Union-Tribune Publishing Co.<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

We need<br/>\nto figure out how people get in trouble with it,&quot; said Dr. Al Cooper of the<br/>\nSan Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre, who conducted the survey in<br/>\nconjunction with MSNBC.<br/>\n<br/>\nCooper, who has conducted a series of surveys probing the growing world of<br/>\nInternet sex, said his latest study was aimed at identifying those at risk<br/>\nfor cybersex addiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nCulling through some 40,000 responses to a poll posted at the MSNBC site,<br/>\nCooper examined a random sample of some 7,000 male respondents and further<br/>\nnarrowed the group down to 384 who indicated they had problems with online<br/>\nsexual activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese respondents reported that they engaged in cybersex for an average of<br/>\nabout 5.7 hours per week, or twice as much time as the rest of the sample.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpending more hours trolling the Internet&#39;s porn sites and sex chat rooms<br/>\nwas only one signifier of online sexual compulsion, Cooper said.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of those who reported cybersex addiction said they went online to<br/>\nrelieve stress, rather than for entertainment or sex information.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;People do it again and again and again, instead of running or talking to<br/>\ntheir partner,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;There are alternate ways of relieving stress<br/>\nthat are probably healthier.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also said they spent time engaging in cybersexual activities that they<br/>\nwould never attempt in real life.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;These people go online to do things, whether it&#39;s with animals or<br/>\nthreesomes or homosexual or whatever -- that they wouldn&#39;t do in their<br/>\noffline life,&quot; Cooper said.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This tends to reinforce a split between their online and offline life,&quot; he<br/>\nsaid. &quot;The Internet can be good in the sense that you can experiment and<br/>\ncheck it out, but if you never resolve it offline, it creates a fantasy life<br/>\nthat the research finds to be problematic.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCooper said that most of those respondents who reported signs of cybersex<br/>\ncompulsion also reported reduced real time sexual activity with an offline<br/>\npartner -- further alienating their real and fantasy sex lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome experts have questioned the validity of Cooper&#39;s findings, noting that<br/>\nthe self-selecting nature of the respondents meant it was not as<br/>\nscientifically useful as a true, random poll.<br/>\n<br/>\nEditors at MSNBC have said they posted the survey because they found it<br/>\ninteresting, not to obtain hard scientific results.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Cooper, a psychologist who teaches at Stanford University, said the<br/>\nfledgling field of online sexuality studies required new methods of<br/>\ngathering data and that Internet polls could reach a much larger and more<br/>\ndiverse group than traditional surveys.<br/>\n<br/>\nCooper said the next survey, due out in several months, would take a broader<br/>\nlook at cybersex compulsion and would include data from women --<br/>\nstatistically believed to have a lower rate of &quot;cyber-addiction&quot; than men.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecent statistics show that between December 1999 and February 2001, the<br/>\nnumber of individual visitors to sexual sites grew by more than 27 percent,<br/>\nto nearly 28 million from 22 million. Over the same period, retail sites<br/>\nshowed growth at less than half that rate.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What we would expect over time is that there is going to be an increase,&quot;<br/>\nhe said. &quot;Some people convert to problematic Internet usage, and the real<br/>\nproblem then is that they don&#39;t seem to be able to find their way out of<br/>\nit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright 2002 Union-Tribune Publishing Co.<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teenage Boys etc.","postDate":"1010168042","msgId":2116,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRlLjQ2N2FlZGQuMjk2NzRhZWFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":2114,"nextInTopic":2117,"prevInTime":2115,"nextInTime":2117,"topicId":2084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-856380728\">&lt;&lt; When I was growing up in a bad early-teenagehood, I turned to fantasy and<br/>\nscience fiction for escape.
