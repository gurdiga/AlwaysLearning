Jaiden(5) is really good about knowing what&#39;s okay for him. <br/>\nHe really wanted to stay up and watch Evil Dead with us. We didn&#39;t <br/>\nhave a problem with him watching it, we said okay. He then asked us <br/>\nif it was a really scary movie. We said, yah kinda. He thought about <br/>\nit and asked us if we would watch it with him in the morning, that <br/>\nway if it scared him too much he could go and play instead of going <br/>\nto bed. He decides the next morning that it was a little to scary for <br/>\nhim right now, but he&#39;d like to try again when he&#39;s 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;They do not have the mental and emotionally<br/>\nmaturity of an adult.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell....I know lots of adults that my kids are waaayyyy more mentally <br/>\nand emotionally mature than. And they are 2.5 and 5.5 :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLetting them decide and then<br/>\nprocess the results can have huge consequences when<br/>\nthe trial involves material that the child is not<br/>\nemotionally prepared to handle.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut they aren&#39;t making the decisions and then processing them in a <br/>\nvacume. They are with parents that love them, care about them and <br/>\nrespect the fact that they are individuals with needs, wants and <br/>\ndesires of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;So yes, i will screen<br/>\nmy sons books while he is young.  Yes i do monitor the<br/>\ncomputer while he is young.  This is called healthy<br/>\nprotection.  If he came across something that<br/>\noverwhelmed him, talking about it would not erase the<br/>\nnegative impact, it might lessen it but some damage<br/>\nmight still be done.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never refused a book, computer game, video game....that our <br/>\nkids have shown an interest in. If we had Jaiden may not have the <br/>\npassion for ancient Egypt that he has, all because of the Mummy <br/>\nmovies he watched when he was 1! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does overwhelming have to have a negitive impact? I&#39;m often <br/>\noverwhelmed-UnschoolingDiscussion overwhelms me almost every day ;)- <br/>\nI am curious what negitive impact you think books, games and movies <br/>\nwould have, that may cause damage that may not be able to be undone?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Would you <br/>\nreally let a five year old access to<br/>\npornography, murder scenes, etc... I hope not!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my boys have access to the world, and everything in it. They <br/>\nare both facinated with car chases, monsters, and 80&#39;s horror movies. <br/>\nAvery(2.5) doesn&#39;t notice kissing and love scenes in movies. And <br/>\nJaiden will sometimes watch them and sometimes looks down and playes <br/>\nwith the tons of toys that frequently watch movies with us.

When they test limits and the limits are not<br/>\n&gt; enforced it leaves them with a feeling that they are<br/>\n&gt; in charge.

This is meant on the<br/>\n&gt; emotional level.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; A child is not old enough to be in charge of their<br/>\n&gt; overall well being, safety, etc...  Everything needs<br/>\n&gt; to be developmentally based. What is appropriate for<br/>\n&gt; an eight year old to decide for him or herself is not<br/>\n&gt; appropriate for a five or two year old.  A young child<br/>\n&gt; can not be expected to have the discernment and<br/>\n&gt; attunement, nor know the consequences of their<br/>\n&gt; actions.  They do not have the mental and emotionally<br/>\n&gt; maturity of an adult.  Letting them decide and then<br/>\n&gt; process the results can have huge consequences when<br/>\n&gt; the trial involves material that the child is not<br/>\n&gt; emotionally prepared to handle.

I think there is a<br/>\nbig difference in overprotection such as you are<br/>\nsuspecting me of, and healthy boundaries which allows<br/>\na child to feel secure.  Children need to know that<br/>\nsomeone is looking out for their safety and well<br/>\nbeing.  When they test limits and the limits are not<br/>\nenforced it leaves them with a feeling that they are<br/>\nin charge.  Even though they may be able to see their<br/>\nparent, they don&#39;t experience the benefits of a parent<br/>\nwho is appropriately holding the space that is needed<br/>\nfor the child to unfold in a healthy manner. <br/>\ntherefore my previous phrase  &quot;they don&#39;t know where<br/>\ntheir parent actually is&quot;.  This is meant on the<br/>\nemotional level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA child is not old enough to be in charge of their<br/>\noverall well being, safety, etc...  Everything needs<br/>\nto be developmentally based. What is appropriate for<br/>\nan eight year old to decide for him or herself is not<br/>\nappropriate for a five or two year old.  A young child<br/>\ncan not be expected to have the discernment and<br/>\nattunement, nor know the consequences of their<br/>\nactions.  They do not have the mental and emotionally<br/>\nmaturity of an adult.  Letting them decide and then<br/>\nprocess the results can have huge consequences when<br/>\nthe trial involves material that the child is not<br/>\nemotionally prepared to handle.  So yes, i will screen<br/>\nmy sons books while he is young.  Yes i do monitor the<br/>\ncomputer while he is young.  This is called healthy<br/>\nprotection.  If he came across something that<br/>\noverwhelmed him, talking about it would not erase the<br/>\nnegative impact, it might lessen it but some damage<br/>\nmight still be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you really let a five year old access to<br/>\npornography, murder scenes, etc... I hope not!<br/>\n<br/>\nMary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDana and I wrote previously:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; -=- Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not<br/>\n&gt; knowing<br/>\n&gt; what is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the<br/>\n&gt; parent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Mary, when you say this it reminds me of my neighbor,<br/>\nwho told me she couldn&#39;t let her kids out of the house<br/>\nanymore during the day, because when she was drunk she<br/>\nalways lost them, which made her husband mad...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut seriously, what kind of &quot;adequate boundaries&quot; are<br/>\nyou suggesting need to be in our children&#39;s lives?

Oh, better read all of<br/>\ntheir library books before they do as well....there<br/>\nmight be something suspect in them....<br/>\n<br/>\nIn our house, the viewer decides for him and herself<br/>\nwhat to watch, and no one else...But mom and dad are<br/>\nthere to discuss before, during and after what they<br/>\nmight see.....Does that make me a &quot;bad&quot; parent, Mary? <br/>\nI don&#39;t see my children looking around saying &quot;Where<br/>\nis my mother!

I would like<br/>\n&gt; to add a few clarifying thoughts of my own.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...on choice,  below you responded to my point about<br/>\n&gt; reaction versus choice... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ...I don&#39;t think anyone ever chooses &quot;the exact<br/>\n&gt; opposite&quot; in all things........But with unschooling<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s neither of those things.....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I never meant to imply that someone would choose the<br/>\n&gt; opposite in all things, however in individual things<br/>\n&gt; like how we discipline, how we nurture, how we set<br/>\n&gt; boundaries, etc... the choice itself may either be a<br/>\n&gt; conscious choice or a reaction depending on how much<br/>\n&gt; we have resolved any issues, should there be any<br/>\n&gt; that<br/>\n&gt; would influence a reaction versus a true choice.  To<br/>\n&gt; just outright say that with unschooling this is not<br/>\n&gt; the case, in my opinion is a generalization that<br/>\n&gt; does<br/>\n&gt; not take into account the personal experience of the<br/>\n&gt; individual in the given situation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Again to my point about inadequate boundaries where<br/>\n&gt; i<br/>\n&gt; write:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=- Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not<br/>\n&gt; knowing<br/>\n&gt; what is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the<br/>\n&gt; parent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You responded by saying,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s not an issue with attachment parenting.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well, on one level I agree with you, true AP honors<br/>\n&gt; the full needs of the child including the needed<br/>\n&gt; boundaries etc..., however, given that we are all<br/>\n&gt; human, we bring into our parenting experiences both<br/>\n&gt; the healthy and unhealthy influences from our past. <br/>\n&gt; At times these influences negatively effect our<br/>\n&gt; ability to set healthy boundaries even when in<br/>\n&gt; theory<br/>\n&gt; we are APing.  I have witnessed many AP parents<br/>\n&gt; struggle with their own childhood issues and<br/>\n&gt; therefore<br/>\n&gt; at times be unable to identify the true needs of<br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; child.  Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>\n&gt; experience. We are not Gods, we make mistakes, we<br/>\n&gt; learn.  The decision to practice AP while a huge<br/>\n&gt; step<br/>\n&gt; in the right direction, does not excempt us from<br/>\n&gt; these<br/>\n&gt; lessons, or from the influences of our past.  Only<br/>\n&gt; our<br/>\n&gt; personal committment to seperating out our own<br/>\n&gt; issues<br/>\n&gt; from those of our child will allow our children to<br/>\n&gt; unfold naturally.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; \t<br/>\n&gt; \t\t<br/>\n&gt; __________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Friends.

My son went through a few infrequent<br/>\n&gt; expressions of wanting to hurt himself if he didn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get his way.  My response, was to hold him closely,<br/>\n&gt; tell him i love him, and show how sad i was to see<br/>\n&gt; him<br/>\n&gt; do that.  I told him it was my job to protect him,<br/>\n&gt; and<br/>\n&gt; i wasn&#39;t going to let him hurt himself. So i rocked<br/>\n&gt; him, cuddled him, nursed him.  I directed his<br/>\n&gt; anger/frustration outwards to hitting pillows, or<br/>\n&gt; giving him the language that could help him<br/>\n&gt; articulate<br/>\n&gt; his feelings.  I matched his intonations with equal<br/>\n&gt; passion when he verbalized &quot;I want to...&quot;,  I<br/>\n&gt; repeated<br/>\n&gt; his statements to let him know i heard him.  I<br/>\n&gt; affirmed his right to be angry.  And because i loved<br/>\n&gt; him it was my job to keep him safe.  He seemed to<br/>\n&gt; get<br/>\n&gt; it, and let it go as an option. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  It sounds to me like your solution is very similar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You surround her with love, and let her know it is<br/>\n&gt; sad<br/>\n&gt; for you when she hurts herself.  Repeating the<br/>\n&gt; injury<br/>\n&gt; on yourself, is dramatic.  My only concern is that<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; might be hard to understand why mommy can do it and<br/>\n&gt; not her, but it sounds like she is getting the<br/>\n&gt; underlying message which is both mommy and she<br/>\n&gt; should<br/>\n&gt; not hurt themselves.  I would say trust your<br/>\n&gt; intuition<br/>\n&gt; on this one, and observe her response.  The comment<br/>\n&gt; by<br/>\n&gt; another list member about being careful about<br/>\n&gt; therapists is a good one.  As a counselor myself, i<br/>\n&gt; hate to say that there are many professionals out<br/>\n&gt; there that are not child centered, and are quick to<br/>\n&gt; label and create more problem than previously<br/>\n&gt; existed.<br/>\n&gt;  Having said all that, it is a gem to find a truly<br/>\n&gt; AP<br/>\n&gt; centered therapist who provides the needed help. <br/>\n&gt; Someone mentioned Jan Hunt.  Jan is wonderful.  I<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt; spoken with her and she is great.  I found her<br/>\n&gt; particular useful for information and resouces, as<br/>\n&gt; well as normalizing the sometimes unheard of<br/>\n&gt; behaviours that our children sometimes choose.  If<br/>\n&gt; you<br/>\n&gt; were wanting to do your own deep work around an<br/>\n&gt; issue<br/>\n&gt; however, then someone else might be a better choice,<br/>\n&gt; as i found Jan to be more of an educator than a<br/>\n&gt; therapist.  (This might be perfect)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In my response to you I  didn&#39;t mean for it to <br/>\n&gt; sound<br/>\n&gt; like I definately thought that you were<br/>\n&gt; &quot;unparenting&quot;,<br/>\n&gt; however i did wonder if healthy boundaries were in<br/>\n&gt; place. I am glad to hear that they are. You are<br/>\n&gt; absolutely right when you say &quot;you can&#39;t always do<br/>\n&gt; as<br/>\n&gt; she demands&quot;, and your statement let&#39;s me know that<br/>\n&gt; you do have boundaries with her.  The video choice,<br/>\n&gt; even though it is Disney, still concerns me.  It is<br/>\n&gt; not a choice that i would make. Even though the self<br/>\n&gt; hurting behaviour began before the videos started i<br/>\n&gt; would still be very selective about showing them. I<br/>\n&gt; am<br/>\n&gt; curious to know what harm you think could come from<br/>\n&gt; limiting her viewing or something that potentially<br/>\n&gt; may<br/>\n&gt; be disturbing to her?  I agree with the other reader<br/>\n&gt; that said she might be a wonderfully sensitive child<br/>\n&gt; who has difficultly processing the images in these<br/>\n&gt; videos.  However, above all, I think that after<br/>\n&gt; gathering all the information, you are the best one<br/>\n&gt; to<br/>\n&gt; make the decision for your child, and you will <br/>\n&gt; ultimately know what is best.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any way Heidi,  I wish you the best.  blessings,<br/>\n&gt; mary<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    Date: Mon, 24 May 2004 13:42:05 -0400<br/>\n&gt; &gt;    From: badolbilz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: thoughts about kids hurting<br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you, Mary.  We have changed our lifestyle<br/>\n&gt; &gt; since becoming <br/>\n&gt; &gt; unschoolers, but not to a point of outright<br/>\n&gt; &gt; unparenting, which is what I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; suspect you read into it.  My comment on her<br/>\n&gt; perhaps<br/>\n&gt; &gt; picking up violence <br/>\n&gt; &gt; from movies was based on movies like Sinbad and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other cartoon-types <br/>\n&gt; &gt; where someone gets killed.  Perhaps she&#39;s not<br/>\n&gt; ready<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for these things, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; but she is interested in watching them and I feel<br/>\n&gt; it<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be more <br/>\n&gt; &gt; harmful to forbid these things than to let her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; watch.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Mostly, she hurts herself or threatens to when she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t get her way. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  An example would be if I don&#39;t do what she asked<br/>\n&gt; at<br/>\n&gt; &gt; just that moment, <br/>\n&gt; &gt; she threatens to hurt herself.  If I get after her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; for doing something <br/>\n&gt; &gt; inapproriate to one of her sisters, she may<br/>\n&gt; threaten<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to kill herself. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  In reading that, you may think she&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; spoiled. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; The worry then is <br/>\n&gt; &gt; sometimes she actually will hurt herself.  Then<br/>\n&gt; &gt; older she gets, there <br/>\n&gt; &gt; are more ways she can hurt herself.  I can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; always<br/>\n&gt; &gt; do as she demands. <br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I can&#39;t punish her for hurting herself.  I<br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;e<br/>\n&gt; &gt; been able to stop <br/>\n&gt; &gt; her from hurting herself.  I have thought long and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hard about what to do <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to help her learn to deal with impatience, anger,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and frustration.  It <br/>\n&gt; &gt; could be just a stage she&#39;s going through at 3<br/>\n&gt; 1/2. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; What really bothers <br/>\n&gt; &gt; me is that she&#39;s been hurting herself since about<br/>\n&gt; 18<br/>\n&gt; &gt; months.  It <br/>\n&gt; &gt; definitely wasn&#39;t from watching movies and tv<br/>\n&gt; then.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; So I&#39;ve began a new strategy.  It&#39;s rather extreme<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and I really don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; &gt; know if it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hasn&#39;t hurt herself in <br/>\n&gt; &gt; over two weeks.  It began like this:  After one<br/>\n&gt; &gt; episode where she was <br/>\n&gt; &gt; yanking her hair and threatening to run out in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; street to get hit by <br/>\n&gt; &gt; a car, I say her on my lap and said that I loved<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her.  That every time <br/>\n&gt; &gt; she got hurt, it hurt me because I love her so<br/>\n&gt; much.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;  I told her that I <br/>\n&gt; &gt; gave birth to her out of my tummy because I wanted<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her to be alive and <br/>\n&gt; &gt; to be happy.  Then I told her that because she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t see how much it <br/>\n&gt; &gt; hurt me when she hurt herself, I would show her. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; From then on, whenever <br/>\n&gt; &gt; she hurt herself, I would do the same thing to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; myself.  And I have.  The <br/>\n&gt; &gt; last time she&#39;s hurt herself was at this computer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; She was upset <br/>\n&gt; &gt; because the game she was playing was too hard so<br/>\n&gt; she<br/>\n&gt; &gt; began to slam her <br/>\n&gt; &gt; knee on the edge of the desk.  So I did the same. <br/>\n&gt; I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; ended up cutting my <br/>\n&gt; &gt; knee in two places and making a huge bruise.  I<br/>\n&gt; know<br/>\n&gt; &gt; this sounds awful <br/>\n&gt; &gt; and very dramatic and I guess it is.  But it made<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; huge impression on <br/>\n&gt; &gt; her.  She was very upset to see her mommy hurt.  I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; told her that&#39;s how <br/>\n&gt; &gt; upset I feel when she hurts herself.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have no idea if this is the right thing to do. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; But it&#39;s all I could <br/>\n&gt; &gt; think of.  <br/>\n&gt; &gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your insights.

Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>\n&gt; experience. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m probably generalizing discussions from<br/>\n&gt; www.unschooling.com and <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The ongoing discussion for years has involved people<br/>\n&gt; being aware of why and <br/>\n&gt; what so they can be makig decisions as clearly as<br/>\n&gt; they can, based on principles <br/>\n&gt; and priorities.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a way, we don&#39;t need to identify the true needs<br/>\n&gt; of our children if we give <br/>\n&gt; them enough leeway to indicate by choosing one thing<br/>\n&gt; over another how much <br/>\n&gt; closeness they want, how much activity or quiet they<br/>\n&gt; want, etc.   <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think my kids need safety and a lot of freedom<br/>\n&gt; within that safe <br/>\n&gt; environment.  (Some people&#39;s &quot;safety&quot; would be<br/>\n&gt; repression or restriction from my point of <br/>\n&gt; view, I know.)  I think they need opportunities and<br/>\n&gt; experiences and input, <br/>\n&gt; and the right and power to say &quot;No thanks, not now,<br/>\n&gt; not that.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Some &quot;childhood issues&quot; are not &quot;issues&quot; in the<br/>\n&gt; sense that they&#39;re emotional <br/>\n&gt; infections.  Some are just calm awarenesses of<br/>\n&gt; things we think hindered more <br/>\n&gt; than helped.   Spankings.  Being put to bed in a<br/>\n&gt; dark room and made to stay <br/>\n&gt; there even with bad dreams.   Those aren&#39;t &quot;issues&quot;<br/>\n&gt; for me, but those things <br/>\n&gt; happened and I decided they were not the way to go. <br/>\n&gt; So am I person who has <br/>\n&gt; decided thoughtlessly to &quot;just&quot; do the opposite of<br/>\n&gt; what my mother did?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It seems more direct to me for people who are<br/>\n&gt; talking about unschooling to <br/>\n&gt; move toward what will help their children learn<br/>\n&gt; without school, and develop into <br/>\n&gt; confident, happy people.  Whether or not someone&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; parents spanked, spanking <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t help with any of that.    Some people don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; spank because their <br/>\n&gt; parents didn&#39;t.  Some don&#39;t spank because their<br/>\n&gt; parents did.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Message: 12<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 24 May 2004 23:49:29 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: badolbilz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: Re: thoughts about kids hurting<br/>\n&gt; themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Julie, I&#39;m sorry to hear you went through such a bad<br/>\n&gt; time.
