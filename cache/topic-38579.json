She said that she<br/>\ndidn&#39;t and she couldn&#39;t get her friend to stop and it actually bothered<br/>\nher.  Wether or not she liked the boys was irrelevant, it was more the<br/>\nfact that running around the neighborhood behaving poorly bothered her. <br/>\nWe do have other neighbors that she would like to continue having a good<br/>\nrelationship with and running around loudly cussing isn&#39;t going to do<br/>\nanything to help that.<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille can see the difference, she can make good judgement calls.

He learned several words from the music he likes, he is also very interested in ratings of movies and video games. He knows all the ratings and he knows why they are rated that way. He even makes up his own games and rates them accordingly, blood, violence, language etc. <br/>\n<br/>\n  On this topic he has learned so much that I don&#39;t want to discount his desire to know this information. We have talked about the words and how some people are offended and where they aren&#39;t appropriate etc. I believe that he understands because he only does it at home. I do have a slight fear that he might slip up around other children whose parents would flip but so far so good. He even beeps himself out, it&#39;s quite comical actually.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll grow out of it and move on to his next interest so we aren&#39;t giving it extra attention just talk about it as we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Words are just words until someone gives them power, I don&#39;t believe there are bad words just words given too much attention by our society. <br/>\n<br/>\n  Stephanie in TN<br/>\n<br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.learningthroughliving-stephanie.blogspot.com\">http://www.learningthroughliving-stephanie.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://familyrun.ning.com/profile/Stephanie\">http://familyrun.ning.com/profile/Stephanie</a><br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;We destroy the love of learning in children, which is so strong when they are small, by encouraging and compelling them to work for petty rewards.&quot;<br/>\n  ~John Holt<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Oh, and about &quot;bad language&quot;","postDate":"1222232472","msgId":38581,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzNTI5LjMxODQ3LnFtQHdlYjMxOTExLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdiY2ZiaitlOW52QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38579,"nextInTopic":38582,"prevInTime":38580,"nextInTime":38582,"topicId":38579,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Well its going to look a lot different in my house prob ....I have a rotten mouth lol.
