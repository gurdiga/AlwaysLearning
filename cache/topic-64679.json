She lived in Alaska and didnt have any <br/>\nkids... still doesnt.  And she would ask, How do you know where hes at, <br/>\nacademically, and , how can he possibly go to college, and other similar <br/>\nquestions.   She had gone to catholic school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started bombarding her with news reports of teachers who molested kids, <br/>\ninjured kids, or otherwise abused their power.   And articles about school <br/>\nviolence and underfunding and cut programs and crumbling or contaminated <br/>\nbuildings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I hadnt done that.  I wish I had just said, Claire, STOP.  I know <br/>\nyoure worried.  I know you love Dylan.  But youre harassing me and I want <br/>\nyou to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one sister in law usually didnt say anything to me but worked on David <br/>\nand sometimes lit a little flame of worry in him and said stuff either to or <br/>\naround her kids that they would later repeat to us.   Her daughter Lillie was <br/>\nso much like Dylan and there came a time when Lillie was very unhappy at <br/>\nschool, crying a lot, feeling sick a lot, and I said I didnt want Dylan to be <br/>\nas miserable as Lillie, that seemed like torture to me and I wouldnt do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I hadnt said that.   I was so invested in getting her to shush that I <br/>\ndidnt think about how harsh that was.   I wish I had directly asked her to <br/>\nstop it and then resigned myself to the idea that she probably never would.<br/>\n<br/>\nLillie is married now with a nice husband and a new baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64698,"nextTopicId":64704}}
