However, the spelling judgement (with e added)  <br/>\nlargely replaced judgment in the United Kingdom in a non-legal  <br/>\ncontext. In the context of the law, however, judgment is preferred.  <br/>\nThis spelling change contrasts with other similar spelling changes  <br/>\nmade in American English, which were rejected in the UK. In the US at  <br/>\nleast, judgment is still preferred and judgement is considered  <br/>\nincorrect by many American style guides. As with many such spelling  <br/>\ndifferences, both forms are equally acceptable in Canadian English  <br/>\nand Australian English. In New Zealand English the form judgment is  <br/>\nthe preferred spelling in dictionaries, newspapers and legislation,  <br/>\nalthough the variant judgement can also be found in all three  <br/>\ncategories. In South African English, judgement is the more common  <br/>\nform.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070221022424AANtSWu\">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070221022424AANtSWu</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"Verna","from":"&quot;Verna&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Grammar","postDate":"1219074106","msgId":37219,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4YzU3cStkOWZsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhDQUNGNUQ0MTk5ODE1Ni1ENzgtN0RFQHdlYm1haWwtbWQwMS5zeXNvcHMuYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37218,"nextInTopic":37220,"prevInTime":37218,"nextInTime":37220,"topicId":37188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I dont mind a little teasing.

Six  <br/>\nyears I taught English, and never used the textbooks the state  <br/>\nprovided.  I would tape the boxes severely shut so that at inventory  <br/>\ntime they were still all there.  We worked with real errors or  <br/>\namusing made-up errors.  That&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with my kids, too.   I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t do it every time they write, but I helped Kirby with a cover  <br/>\nletter.  Holly and I worked together on an insert to go with a  <br/>\nwedding gift she made.  She trusted me to punctuate because I was at  <br/>\nthe keyboard, but I pointed out one or two things I was doing and  <br/>\nwhy.  Marty has a typo or something (I don&#39;t remember) on MySpace and  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t pint it out.  It&#39;s MySpace.  And Marty spells better right  <br/>\nnow than  his dad did at that age, and his dad had gone to 13 years  <br/>\nof public school and was a college sophomore at that point.  In  <br/>\ncollege, Keith took theatre and math, neither of which is heavy on  <br/>\nspelling requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they ask or when something comes up we talk about it BRIEFLY.   <br/>\nLately with Holly (16) I&#39;ve pointed out a few odd verb forms she&#39;s  <br/>\nguessed wrong (and if a native speaker has to guess, that sometimes  <br/>\nmeans the form is going out of style).  Holly cares about when to  <br/>\nhyphenate words in a phrase.  She&#39;s sixteen and she&#39;s starting to  <br/>\nwrite more.  If you&#39;re building an adjective out of a phrase you can  <br/>\nhyphenate it.  Holly knows the difference between everyday (an  <br/>\nadjective) and every day (an adverbial phrase) but she doesn&#39;t know  <br/>\nthat latter term, I don&#39;t think.  She knows if you&#39;re telling what  <br/>\nkind of thing (an everyday dress or an everyday occurrence) it&#39;s one  <br/>\nword, and if you&#39;re telling when you do it, you might do so every day).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest &quot;bookish&quot; thing for kids is &quot;Schoolhouse Rock,&quot; and their  <br/>\nsongs about parts of speech.  They&#39;re on YouTube, and on CD.

The &quot;school-at-homer&quot; (Doh!) <br/>\n&gt; lists  (you know---the ones with moms who will actually be TEACHING <br/>\n&gt; grammar to their kids???) *those* lists need someone with a red pen to <br/>\n&gt; edit each and every post!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here, you&#39;re looking at the cream of the crop! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I know I haven&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; been &#39;teaching&#39; my daughter grammar per se, but I do make sure that<br/>\n&gt; when she does any writing at all that it is spelled correctly.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any writing at ALL?

I think that, if you&#39;re writing or announcing *for a <br/>\n&gt; living*, you should spend some time to learn the language. Don&#39;t make <br/>\n&gt; stupid, common mistakes. So I yell at the TV...a lot.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think that, if you are publishing a book, you should find someone who <br/>\n&gt; knows more than you do and hire him to edit your work. (I *just* read a <br/>\n&gt; nice book SOOOO full of errors that it was painfully hard to finish.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I try my best to *ALWAYS* speak properly. I *do* correct my boys&#39; <br/>\n&gt; grammar.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I learned it in school, I had a pretty creepy teacher who would <br/>\n&gt; scream out, &quot;Phrase or clause? Noun or not? If not noun, adjective. If <br/>\n&gt; not adjective, adverb! And WWWWHHHHYYYYY???&quot; I remember poor Cal <br/>\n&gt; Harrelson in *tears* (even if he actually got the answer right!) <br/>\n&gt; because he didn&#39;t know *why*. His answer every time would be, &quot;Because <br/>\n&gt; it sounds right?&quot; WRONG answer. But a good lesson for *me*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t want my children to think something &quot;sounds right&quot; unless it IS <br/>\n&gt; right. So they have NEVER heard me say, &quot;Me and Ben are going out <br/>\n&gt; tonight.&quot; Never. Not ONCE.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; They&#39;ve NEVER heard me say:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Go real slow.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s a good thing for you and I to be doing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We can ask whomever is at the information booth.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;They was asking for it!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We literally died laughing.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;He resents me going.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Who are you waiting to see?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;m going to go lay down for a while.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;If I was queen, there would be no school.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;We have less chairs than we need.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Just between you and I,...&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;He was hung.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Can you loan me $10?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;You should of picked that up.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &quot;A child needs their questions answered.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming <br/>\n&gt; &quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct. <br/>\n&gt; If they were to say anything similar to those examples above, I would <br/>\n&gt; correct them---just as I correct newscasters. &lt;g&gt;. They don&#39;t have to <br/>\n&gt; &quot;fix&quot; the problem----and they don&#39;t even have to acknowledge my <br/>\n&gt; presence! &lt;G&gt; But I don&#39;t want bad grammar *in their heads*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m willing to answer questions ANY time. Occasionally, one of the boys <br/>\n&gt; will ask *why* something&#39;s wrong. I answer, but I try not to make it a <br/>\n&gt; long explanation.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Cameron&#39;s been writing a lot lately. He&#39;ll often ask me to edit. <br/>\n&gt; Usually he has the right *number* of commas; they&#39;re just in the wrong <br/>\n&gt; places. &lt;G&gt; But it wasn&#39;t until just a few years ago that he started to <br/>\n&gt; REALLY want to understand *why*. So I&#39;ve started to explain the reasons <br/>\n&gt; behind &quot;possessives before gerunds&quot; and &quot;transitive and intransitive&quot; <br/>\n&gt; and &quot;what adverbs and adjectives modify&quot; and &quot;predicate nominatives.&quot; <br/>\n&gt; But because these aren&#39;t *totally* foreign concepts to him, they&#39;re <br/>\n&gt; easier to grasp.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s kind of like understanding the *CONCEPTS* of math and THEN adding <br/>\n&gt; the symbols. Understand how to use everyday language (correctly!) and <br/>\n&gt; THEN learn the *why*.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; In a forum like *this*---where the thought process is more important <br/>\n&gt; than the delivery---it&#39;s easier for me to let things go. This won&#39;t be <br/>\n&gt; published (well, maybe electronically on Sandra&#39;s site &lt;g&gt;), and often <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m more interested in getting supper made between posts. &lt;G&gt; But I <br/>\n&gt; think published written works *should* be edited. And I think news <br/>\n&gt; anchors *should* make spoken language a priority. And I think newspaper <br/>\n&gt; owners should make their editors earn their paychecks. &lt;G&gt; But that&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; just me. (*I*! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But as for &quot;getting proper grammar&quot; from my children: I choose to be <br/>\n&gt; the example at all times. (In my opinion, Southerners *sound* stupid <br/>\n&gt; enough with our accents; there&#39;s no need to add fuel to THAT fire! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>\n&gt; If they hear it correctly from the get-go, it sounds natural and <br/>\n&gt; &quot;right.&quot; I want the *correct* way to sound &quot;normal&quot; to their ears.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So...be the example you want to see. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Kelly Lovejoy<br/>\n&gt; Conference Coordinator<br/>\n&gt; Live and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Grammar","postDate":"1219064059","msgId":37195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc4YnJkcisxMnVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDVDNzIwOTBFLTdFNDQtNEQxNy04MjU0LUE4OTUwMDJEODBDOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":37194,"nextInTopic":37196,"prevInTime":37194,"nextInTime":37196,"topicId":37188,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~~ Just a handful of very, VERY common mistakes ( though some are becoming vernacular ), but I don t want my children to think they are correct.~~ I think","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1395444673\">~~<br/>\nJust a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming<br/>\n&quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct.~~<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people talk different than they write and since language is<br/>\nevolving, what is &quot;correct&quot; today will NOT be tomorrow. &quot;Mistakes&quot; of<br/>\n50 years ago are not considered incorrect now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think some people love grammar/language and wish everyone would<br/>\nlearn it as thoroughly as they have.

The &quot;school-at-homer&quot; (Doh!) <br/>\nlists  (you know---the ones with moms who will actually be TEACHING <br/>\ngrammar to their kids???) *those* lists need someone with a red pen to <br/>\nedit each and every post!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, you&#39;re looking at the cream of the crop! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I haven&#39;t<br/>\nbeen &#39;teaching&#39; my daughter grammar per se, but I do make sure that<br/>\nwhen she does any writing at all that it is spelled correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAny writing at ALL? Yucky. I don&#39;t see a LOT of what my kids are <br/>\nwriting. But if anything will be published----or if it&#39;s important to <br/>\nthem, they know they can come to me for editing/proofreading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care about my children&#39;s spelling. They have spell check, and I <br/>\nhave *much* more serious issues. Well, I *do* care, but we have such <br/>\neasy and readily available tools at our disposal now!<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is a big beef of mine. Can anyone tell me how they go about <br/>\ngetting proper<br/>\ngrammar from their children while unschooling without having to do any<br/>\nbook teaching?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really think you need &quot;book teaching&quot; to use proper grammar?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a problem (which is silly because there&#39;s absolutely nothing I <br/>\ncan do about it!) with people who are PAID to announce on---or write <br/>\nfor---TV/movies. I think that, if you&#39;re writing or announcing *for a <br/>\nliving*, you should spend some time to learn the language. Don&#39;t make <br/>\nstupid, common mistakes. So I yell at the TV...a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, if you are publishing a book, you should find someone who <br/>\nknows more than you do and hire him to edit your work. (I *just* read a <br/>\nnice book SOOOO full of errors that it was painfully hard to finish.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI try my best to *ALWAYS* speak properly. I *do* correct my boys&#39; <br/>\ngrammar.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I learned it in school, I had a pretty creepy teacher who would <br/>\nscream out, &quot;Phrase or clause? Noun or not? If not noun, adjective. If <br/>\nnot adjective, adverb! And WWWWHHHHYYYYY???&quot; I remember poor Cal <br/>\nHarrelson in *tears* (even if he actually got the answer right!) <br/>\nbecause he didn&#39;t know *why*. His answer every time would be, &quot;Because <br/>\nit sounds right?&quot; WRONG answer. But a good lesson for *me*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want my children to think something &quot;sounds right&quot; unless it IS <br/>\nright. So they have NEVER heard me say, &quot;Me and Ben are going out <br/>\ntonight.&quot; Never. Not ONCE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve NEVER heard me say:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go real slow.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s a good thing for you and I to be doing.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s important.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We can ask whomever is at the information booth.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;They was asking for it!&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We literally died laughing.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;He resents me going.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Who are you waiting to see?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m going to go lay down for a while.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;If I was queen, there would be no school.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;We have less chairs than we need.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Just between you and I,...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;He was hung.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Can you loan me $10?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;You should of picked that up.&quot;<br/>\n&quot;A child needs their questions answered.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a handful of very, VERY common mistakes (&#39;though some are becoming <br/>\n&quot;vernacular&quot;), but I don&#39;t want my children to think they are correct. <br/>\nIf they were to say anything similar to those examples above, I would <br/>\ncorrect them---just as I correct newscasters. &lt;g&gt;. They don&#39;t have to <br/>\n&quot;fix&quot; the problem----and they don&#39;t even have to acknowledge my <br/>\npresence! &lt;G&gt; But I don&#39;t want bad grammar *in their heads*.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m willing to answer questions ANY time. Occasionally, one of the boys <br/>\nwill ask *why* something&#39;s wrong. I answer, but I try not to make it a <br/>\nlong explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron&#39;s been writing a lot lately. He&#39;ll often ask me to edit. <br/>\nUsually he has the right *number* of commas; they&#39;re just in the wrong <br/>\nplaces. &lt;G&gt; But it wasn&#39;t until just a few years ago that he started to <br/>\nREALLY want to understand *why*. So I&#39;ve started to explain the reasons <br/>\nbehind &quot;possessives before gerunds&quot; and &quot;transitive and intransitive&quot; <br/>\nand &quot;what adverbs and adjectives modify&quot; and &quot;predicate nominatives.&quot; <br/>\nBut because these aren&#39;t *totally* foreign concepts to him, they&#39;re <br/>\neasier to grasp.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s kind of like understanding the *CONCEPTS* of math and THEN adding <br/>\nthe symbols. Understand how to use everyday language (correctly!) and <br/>\nTHEN learn the *why*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a forum like *this*---where the thought process is more important <br/>\nthan the delivery---it&#39;s easier for me to let things go. This won&#39;t be <br/>\npublished (well, maybe electronically on Sandra&#39;s site &lt;g&gt;), and often <br/>\nI&#39;m more interested in getting supper made between posts. &lt;G&gt; But I <br/>\nthink published written works *should* be edited. And I think news <br/>\nanchors *should* make spoken language a priority. And I think newspaper <br/>\nowners should make their editors earn their paychecks. &lt;G&gt; But that&#39;s <br/>\njust me. (*I*! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as for &quot;getting proper grammar&quot; from my children: I choose to be <br/>\nthe example at all times.

I rarely change a whole word, but I&#39;ll tweak and polish  <br/>\nslightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the purposes of this list, the ideas are much more important than  <br/>\nthe technicalities of their presentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you find grammatical or spelling errors on my webpages (anything  <br/>\nstarting off SandraDodd.com) I&#39;d be glad to make repairs.  I like  <br/>\ngetting e-mail about errors in formatting or bad links or any of  <br/>\nthat.   I don&#39;t promise to regard any recommendation for a comma  <br/>\nchange, though, because sometimes writing as one speaks can require  <br/>\nsome dashes and commas.  I don&#39;t mind that; I like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently found a spelling list in my 25-year-old writing that says<br/>\n<br/>\nLEARN TO SPELL<br/>\n<br/>\napparently<br/>\n<br/>\nunnecessary<br/>\n<br/>\nballoon<br/>\n<br/>\ninnocence<br/>\n<br/>\nSo those were the words I was having trouble with then.  I guess I  <br/>\nalso have trouble throwing things away, as that list is on my desk  <br/>\nthirty years later.  (Not the same desk.  The list has had adventures  <br/>\nin books and boxes.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do vocal and instrumental music with small groups sometimes.   <br/>\nThere&#39;s a difference between singing for fun or to learn a song and  <br/>\nin performing it.  And there&#39;s another level of requirement and  <br/>\nexpectation if it&#39;s going to be recorded, or if someone&#39;s paying us  <br/>\nto perform it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s the same with writing.  If you&#39;re writing for fun and  <br/>\ninformation, spelling isn&#39;t important.  If on a grocery list we  <br/>\nabbreviate things or misspell them, it doesn&#39;t matter.   If I&#39;m  <br/>\nwriting a letter I&#39;m more careful with spelling and format and either  <br/>\nwrite very carefully or I type (word-process-and-print).   If I&#39;m  <br/>\nwriting for publication, I&#39;m try not to use the same word twice in  <br/>\nthe same piece of writing, I note the length of sentences and the  <br/>\ncadence of the words, wondering how they might sound read aloud.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are different needs for different purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/writing\">http://sandradodd.com/writing</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some things from earlier discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is more interested in spelling and punctuation than her  <br/>\nbrothers are, but just the other day Kirby and I discussed semi- <br/>\ncolons.
