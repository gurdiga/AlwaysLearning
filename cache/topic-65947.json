 What about a tulip festival, or other Easter time activity?  You can also cross reference school type calendars to see what monthly activities are done.  Like black history month, what kind of local events happen where you live?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps go through each school month and think of one or two activities that cost money and add those to the line items, you can mark the dates and tack on a follow up project for them to buy cool crafty things with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is what I would do and how I would present it.  Frame it with the free form ideas of Montessori and within a month to month activities with follow up, along with passes to local area things that are ongoing like zoos and museums, rec centers and parks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: No Curriculum But I Need a Budget","postDate":"1330462016","msgId":65959,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMyRTU1NERFLUFCOTAtNEUyMC1BM0ZFLTk1Q0Q5RUMxQ0VBMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEUzQ0E2ODVCLTg4RkMtNEExNS1BNkRFLTdFRjBCQzg2QUM3NEB5YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEUzQ0E2ODVCLTg4RkMtNEExNS1BNkRFLTdFRjBCQzg2QUM3NEB5YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":65958,"nextInTopic":65962,"prevInTime":65958,"nextInTime":65960,"topicId":65947,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But, when asking for things like a $500 microscope, it feels a little weird to think it s an item I will strew rather than ask them to use for a specific","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1489742546\">-=-But, when asking for things like a $500 microscope, it feels a little weird to think it&#39;s an item I will &quot;strew&quot; rather than ask them to use for a specific bit of learning (though I know they&#39;ll use it - last night they got their cheap microscope down and pretended to be moth scientists, sketching the moth in various positions and calling me Doctor Miliana).
