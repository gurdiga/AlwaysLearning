We are wired differently for<br/>\ndifferent tasks.  But Men need and benefit from<br/>\ncommunity just as much or more so than women, in<br/>\nGENERAL (yes there are exceptions, odd birds, hermits,<br/>\netc).  Men benefit from having same sex deep and<br/>\nsupportive friendships, they benefit from not having<br/>\nto carry the burden of being the adult male alone,<br/>\nthey benefit from being part of a larger group,<br/>\nmentoring younger males, learning from older males,<br/>\nrespecting and interacting with the famles of the<br/>\ngroup in different ways than is typical in our<br/>\nculture.  The whole village/community structure is<br/>\nbeneficial for them, growing up, and as adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was what I meant, that men need more and<br/>\ndifferent and better social interaction than they get<br/>\nin modern western culture.  I meant that men and women<br/>\nare both people, and all people need this.  I didn&#39;t<br/>\nmean they should persue it in exactly the same manner<br/>\nor for exactly the same reasons.

Women crave<br/>\ncommunity, and feel free in our culture to seek it in<br/>\nmany ways: at work, with moms, through hobbies and<br/>\ninterests, etc.  Men crave community as well, and<br/>\ndesire to be approved of and emotionally supported. <br/>\nBut in our culture they are not free to persue that,<br/>\nexcept in a mostly superficial way.

They are not<br/>\ncomfortable following intuition to realize dreams and<br/>\ngoals without facts and logic and caution supporting<br/>\nthose moves.  So they resist community because of<br/>\nthese many reasons, but once they get there, they are<br/>\noverjoyed and become it&#39;s staunchest proponents and<br/>\nprotectors.
