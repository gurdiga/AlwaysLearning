One was a Blockus/Tetris style of game, matching colours, but the<br/>\n   letters were inevitably included in the arrangements.  Also, I would leave<br/>\n   simple notes, using either the bath crayons or foam letters, on the wall of<br/>\n   the tub before he got in.  He would be so excited, asking what it said.<br/>\n   Sometimes he would try to copy it.  Otherwise, he would just go on to<br/>\n   drawing other things.<br/>\n   - I made letter pretzels and pancakes.  Usually my son would ask what&#39;s<br/>\n   this?!  which would lead to some letter fun.  It lasted however long it<br/>\n   lasted while we ate.  Sometimes we would see if we could erase the letters<br/>\n   from the surface of store-bought letter cookies, or chew letters into<br/>\n   store-bought pretzels.<br/>\n   - Our son loves to hop around, and he loves happy faces.  I would cut out<br/>\n   some circles, make happy faces and put letters on the noses and tape them<br/>\n   down the hall.  He loved hopping from room to room this way.  Sometimes he<br/>\n   said the letters, sometimes not, but he always enjoyed the hopping.<br/>\n   - I would make secret spy notes to him with a spy pen we picked up.  It<br/>\n   is possible to make one yourself.  I have seen them online.<br/>\n   - We liked to play mail delivery.  Our son thought up this game.  He took<br/>\n   a cereal box and turned it into a mail box with a flag.  I would write a<br/>\n   very simple note and deliver it, making sure to lift the flag.  He would<br/>\n   retrieve it.<br/>\n   - We pressed letters into playdough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are some examples of how we encorporated some letter fun into our<br/>\ndays.

When unschooling is at its height of <br/>\nawesome, all of those parts are in play.  Sometimes while going about life, one <br/>\nor two of those things get dropped and unschooling can falter.  I try to keep <br/>\nall of those things going day to day, so that it doesn&#39;t falter.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Alphebet, phonics,sight words???????","postDate":"1295562969","msgId":59022,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGloYWRjcCs2dXNxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5QjUzQTEwLUJCQUEtNDJERS1BQ0Q0LTEzRjY5MzVFODg4MEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":59021,"nextInTopic":59024,"prevInTime":59021,"nextInTime":59023,"topicId":59007,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s <br/>\nword play, altering the meaning with altering the letters.  That little magnet <br/>\nalso brought up percentages.  Chamille asked how many 70% was.  I told her that <br/>\nif you had 10 kids lined up, that 70% would be 7 of those kids.  She thought the <br/>\nstatistics were inaccurate, so felt obliged to change it.

I figured if it was just one of the many songs he knew, he would have that information in him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was a walking baby still in diapers, we visited a La Leche League leader&#39;s home--not the leader of my group, but there was a gathering and we were over there.  He was pointing at the magnetic letters on the fridge and naming some of them.   Kathy, the hostess, squatted down next to him and he named a few more.  She asked him what his name was an how old he was.  He looked at her and thought, and then turned back and pointed at &quot;M&quot; and said  &quot;M&quot; very clearly.  He was too little to know how old he was, and he couldn&#39;t say his name clearly yet.  He said &quot;Turby&quot; for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to look for that account in my &quot;Kirby Diary,&quot; one word file I have always backed up and replaced on every new computer.  I didn&#39;t find that story, but found this which has a couple of tie-ins.  It&#39;s a clean cut, unedited.  I left the first one because it had the year.  Kirby was born  July 29, 1986, so he had just turned five.<br/>\n----------------<br/>\nThu, Aug 8, 1991<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to spend the night with Grandma and Grandpa in their trailer at the Monticello trailer park on Central.<br/>\n<br/>\nAugust 15<br/>\n<br/>\n�Why do things on earth need the letters of the alphabet?� <br/>\n<br/>\n[sometime the same day:] he was talking about wanting to go back to dance class, and I reminded him he had hated dance class.  He said, �I don�t mean the dance class where I dance and cry.  I mean the class where I learn stuff.�  (On further questioning, it turned out he meant his art class.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Friday, August 16<br/>\n<br/>\n This week Kirby has been talking about �the West,� and cowboys, and the desert, and the Old West a lot.  I tried again to discuss directions with him, and I talked about history, with examples like when Kirby was little we didn�t have a patio, and now we do, and when Marty was little we didn�t have a door to the patio, and now we do, and when the new baby comes those things will have been there his whole life.  He seemed to be getting the idea that the cowboys used to be in this same place, but it was a long time ago, and that before our house was built, it was the desert right where our house is, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n His most interesting expression about the whole matter was �People who live in the East never get to see the sun go down.�<br/>\n<br/>\n Keith and I took him and Marty �to see the sun set out West in the desert.�  We drove out Friday after work to the other side of Bernalillo, where Keith knew of a dirt road that leads to Rio Rancho.  We drove off on an old leftover bit of highway, and off on this dirt road.  (We took some pictures, so that�ll be in the kids� books.)  It was a little muddy, and they found good sticks (Yucca stalks) and we saw cactus and could find no animal tracks at all, even though the road and a little wash had been very well cleared out by the rain and were muddy (dry enough to walk on, mostly)..  We found a horse�s jawbone with teeth (which Keith scouted out and let Kirby �find� and pull out of the mud) but Kirby wasn�t as impressed by that as he should�ve been.  The sun went down, and we came back.  Kirby fell asleep on the way home and he was satisfied (for a while) about the west and the desert.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mon, Aug 19, 1991<br/>\n<br/>\n For the past couple of days Kirby has started saying, if he and Marty are playing any make-believe (Turtles, Lego, etc.), �We�ll be right back after these messages.�  That means he needs to go to the bathroom and he wants Marty to wait for him.  Today, after he was finished in the toilet, he ran back saying, �We now return to our program.�<br/>\n<br/>\n Sat, Aug 31, 1991<br/>\n<br/>\n Kirby and Marty were playing with toy dinosaurs on Keith�s bed.  There were kids, and a baby, and a mom, and a dad, and family friends who had brought a present, a magnifying glass �But you have to share it, even with the baby,� they said.  Kirby was being the dad and Marty was being the baby (and other kids) and �the dad� said, �Do you kids want to play with me?�  The babies (Marty) said �Yeah!  Yeah!�  �The Dad� said, �Well, sorry.  First I have to type and write and a lot of boring stuff, and when I finish that I�ll play with you.�  OOOh--I thought I was the parent to get stuck with that reputation. I guess it�s me and Keith both.<br/>\n<br/>\n September 4, 1991<br/>\n<br/>\n Kirby had been playing with Kyla and Dane (at James� birthday party at Kit Carson Park), and on the way home he said, �Kyla�s older than Dane, right?�<br/>\n<br/>\n            �Right.�<br/>\n<br/>\n            �Why?�  [and then his own pause] ��and don�t tell me it�s because she was born first.�<br/>\n<br/>\n            When he�d talked to me about why he was older than Marty, I�d said because he was born first; because he was already out of me when Marty wasn�t even born yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThose two classes, the art and dance classes, are the main reason we homeschooled that first year, which led to all those other years.

But as to what it&#39;s called, sometimes &quot;the ABCs.&quot;  And sometimes &quot;alphabet&quot; which is short for &quot;alpha beta&quot; which is &quot;AB.&quot;  Some people are naturally more interested in language than other people.  I am, and my kids are.  Because the subject line is &quot;alphebet,&quot; I&#39;m guessing the mom who asked isn&#39;t very interested in language and might not have thought of the &quot;alpha&quot; in &quot;alphabet.&quot;  So possibly there are other &quot;intelligences&quot; primary in that family.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/intelligences\">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>\n<br/>\nReading comes when it comes, and if it&#39;s pressed too hard too soon, it comes painfully and haltingly, or perhaps the child decides (or is told) that he is &quot;not a reader,&quot; so he loses the will and ability to let it come naturally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think playing with the alphabet should be done if it&#39;s not too painful for the mom to do that.

It has become a cultural phenomenon to push the alphabet at kids really early, but knowing the alphabet at 3 doesn&#39;t guarantee reading at 6. Knowing the alphabet doesn&#39;t necessarily contribute to learning to read. It can even get in the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepson and a friend of mine&#39;s daughter both found paying attention to letters and sounds got in the way of reading when they were first learning (homeschooling, not unschooling). I remember watching Ray puzzle his way through a word and then not remember that word by the time he&#39;d puzzled his way through the next - but he could read short sentences if he recognized the words already. My girlfriend saw something similar with her daughter, but even more so - she could read whole sentences but not all the individual words in them, and couldn&#39;t identify all the letters. Both kids could &quot;decode&quot; words using letter-sound correspondences *after* they had learned to read, but not before. <br/>\n<br/>\nMorgan, otoh, fell in love with the alphabet and reading at 4 and had a wonderful time cracking the code. By then I&#39;d found unschooling and was pretty awe-struck to see her spend hours sounding-out short books, going back and correcting herself when a word didn&#39;t make sense in context... just like teachers tell people the &quot;should&quot; do, but no-one was teaching Mo. It was just the most logical way for her to get what she wanted. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she cracked the code (a few months) she dropped reading for a couple years. That&#39;s something else that you lose sight of with schoolish thinking - learning doesn&#39;t depend on some kind of steady progress and regular practice, necessarily.

Sculpture however is also found objects (whole objects) and<br/>\nsubtraction (removing layers to get underneath). Reading is the same. It can<br/>\nbe approached in several different ways. By different individuals. As well<br/>\nas by the same person.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchooling gets in the way of learning to read by insisting things like that<br/>\nlearning the alphabet is foundational to reading. It isn&#39;t. You can pick it<br/>\nup in other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very much drawn to fonts and shapes of whole words. I love calligraphy<br/>\nbecause it can reveal the &quot;body&quot; of a word&#39;s unique shape. The Chi Ro book<br/>\n(Book of Kell) is so amazing because no matter how falsely colored or even<br/>\nuncolored it is, the shape of those famous words is instantly recognizable.<br/>\nBecause I am drawn to word shapes I can spell words very easily. If the<br/>\nshape is wrong I know it&#39;s misspelled. The word &quot;the&quot; is perfect but not if<br/>\nyou switch the letters around and change the shape to &quot;teh&quot; which is nothing<br/>\nlike the same shape even though it has the same exact letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say the biggest reason I might be drawn to whole words is not because I<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand the alphabet but because I&#39;m better at recognizing things<br/>\nthat are whole than recognizing pieces of them or their sequences. When I<br/>\nget to the sequence portions in IQ tests, I can remember sequences by<br/>\nrecalling the whole shape, if that&#39;s the way they&#39;re presented. Otherwise, I<br/>\nhave a harder time remembering the order things come in and I slow way way<br/>\ndown.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhonics was hard for me because I don&#39;t hear well and also because English<br/>\nvaries what you can do with a single letter QUITE a bit. Not a total loss<br/>\nbut not the most helpful way for me to learn either. I remember intonation,<br/>\nphrasing and speed in people&#39;s voices very well and can often pick out who&#39;s<br/>\nspeaking because it&#39;s like hearing the shape of a person&#39;s voice. Again,<br/>\nit&#39;s easiest for me to learn things by experiencing the whole thing, at<br/>\nleast at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jan 20, 2011 at 8:31 AM, Joyce Fetteroll &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a>&gt;wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jan 20, 2011, at 5:24 AM, Susan wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Does a person need to know the alphabet to learn to read?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Depends on the person.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; *But* a person who needs the alphabet to help them understand words<br/>\n&gt; will be playing with the alphabet.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So your son is letting you know what he needs by not being fascinated<br/>\n&gt; by the alphabet!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think that&#39;s one of the foundational ideas about unschooling.
