I always enjoy hearing how other people think they would handle things--I am learning so much from this group!  <br/>\n    I just want to add one nugget of info to the discussion on depression.  In several studies on depression, regular exercise out-performed SSRI antidepressants (like Prozac) in effectiveness.  Of course, I have no idea how to get your mother to take a walk every day and start lifting weights with Joyce Vedral, but it might actually help.  Speaking of that Vedral woman, she has a book titled, I Can&#39;t Take it Any More:  How to Get Up When You&#39;re Really Low.  I had heard that she was &quot;inspirational,&quot; but I didn&#39;t know she had written this book until I was looking for a copy of one of her books on weight-lifting.   By the way, she&#39;s at least 50, so maybe you can get your mother turned on to her.  Good luck!!

Some<br/>\n&gt; unconscious need that has to be met... I wish I had an example, but that<br/>\nis<br/>\n&gt; the thought that crossed my mind as I read your story.  If you knew what<br/>\n&gt; need were creating the depression, then it would be easier for you and her<br/>\n&gt; to find ways to help meet that need in a more healthy way for everyone.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; One good way to tap into what the unconscious negative thoughts (or core<br/>\n&gt; beliefs, I call them) might be is to take a piece of paper divided into<br/>\ntwo<br/>\n&gt; columns.  Then on the left write a positive statement to counter the<br/>\n&gt; negative thoughts (for your Mom, something like &quot;My life is happy and<br/>\n&gt; fulfilling now&quot;) and on the right side write whatever immediately comes to<br/>\n&gt; the mind w/o any thought about it.  If nothing comes, then write the<br/>\n&gt; positive statement again.  Do this about 20-30 times, and you&#39;ll be amazed<br/>\n&gt; what can come up.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I realize that I&#39;m making it sound really easy, and I know it&#39;s not.  I<br/>\n&gt; think back on my own life, and know that when I have created a negative<br/>\n&gt; pattern (like getting angry and using that to push others away from me)<br/>\n&gt; it&#39;s really related to a fear (that I am not loveable) -- so I have a need<br/>\n&gt; to create a situation where I can have an external obvious excuse as to<br/>\nwhy<br/>\n&gt; the person may have rejected me (the anger and the pushing away) rather<br/>\n&gt; than to leave open the possibility that they would reject the real me<br/>\n&gt; because I&#39;m not loveable.  Once I saw the underlying need that I had, I<br/>\nwas<br/>\n&gt; able to choose to love myself - which then meant that I wanted to be<br/>\nloving<br/>\n&gt; to myself and not push people away.  Mine is a different story, but<br/>\nperhaps<br/>\n&gt; there is something similar going on for your Mom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ciao<br/>\n&gt; --bc--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

She expects me to react by asking her to move out, or some <br/>\nother drastic move.<br/>\nI&#39;m sure if she was telling me about her problems all the time, it <br/>\nwould be very tiresome... but she&#39;s a &quot;stuffer&quot; and tries to pretend <br/>\neverythings ok.  I think, for her, letting it out more would be good, <br/>\nbecause it wouldn&#39;t have that chance to build and build.  That <br/>\ninability to tell me (or anyone else)about what she&#39;s feeling is what <br/>\nI see as being fear-based and tied into self esteem.<br/>\nI&#39;m glad that your mom had her &quot;epiphany&quot; after her brush with <br/>\ndeath.  My mom had a similar experience, (not an aneurism) 12 years <br/>\nago, and had to relearn all the basics as well.  Talk, walk, eat, etc <br/>\netc etc.  In her case though, I think it made her dependent and <br/>\nunsure of herself, unable to handle or do things.  Part of that I <br/>\nbelieve is the nature of the injury, and part of it has to do with <br/>\nhow she now sees herself.  Self worth is very dependent on all of us <br/>\nbeing able to do things for ourselves.  Disability changes that.  For <br/>\nsome people, it definitely is life affirming.  They stop taking <br/>\nthings for granted, and realize what&#39;s important in life.  I just <br/>\nwish I knew how to show that to her.

I think she is very depressed - and I know the symptoms <br/>\nwell. <br/>\n&gt; &gt; I also went through a major depression from mid teens through mid <br/>\n&gt; &gt; twenties, that no drug or therapy seemed to help.  What finally <br/>\ndid <br/>\n&gt; &gt; help was - you guessed it - CHOOSING to be happy, and to take <br/>\n&gt; &gt; responsibility for my life.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think there&#39;s a lot of misunderstanding about depression as an <br/>\nillness,<br/>\n&gt; and also, of course, the etiology and course of a depressive <br/>\nepisode will<br/>\n&gt; be different for everyone. It&#39;s great that you were able to chose <br/>\nto get<br/>\n&gt; your life back on track and it worked for you - I did something <br/>\nlike that<br/>\n&gt; when I found out I was pregnant 12 years ago, and decided to pretty <br/>\nmuch<br/>\n&gt; change everything and get my life on track so I could be a good <br/>\nparent.<br/>\n&gt; At that point my life was pretty messed up, and although I think the<br/>\n&gt; therapy I got helped, the real change was something I did.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; However... I also have had periodic episodes of depression going <br/>\nback 30<br/>\n&gt; years. When I&#39;m depressed, in a clinical sense, no amount of &quot;pep <br/>\ntalks&quot;<br/>\n&gt; help. I cry about traffic, I cry about spilled milk, and I cry about<br/>\n&gt; nothing at all. Everything takes an enormous amount of effort - in <br/>\nsome<br/>\n&gt; ways it&#39;s like having a bad flu and trying to drag myself <br/>\nthroughthe day.<br/>\n&gt; And what helps is getting myself onto an antidepressant that works <br/>\nfor me<br/>\n&gt; and taking it for a week or so, until it starts to kick in and lift <br/>\nthe<br/>\n&gt; fog. I suppose it is me choosing to take the pills, but if they <br/>\nweren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; available (and the ones that work for me weren&#39;t until I was in my <br/>\nearly<br/>\n&gt; twenties) I wouldn&#39;t be able to just &quot;choose&quot; to be happy, any more <br/>\nthan<br/>\n&gt; my diabetic grandpa could &quot;choose&quot; to make more insulin or my dad <br/>\ncan<br/>\n&gt; &quot;chose&quot; to breathe when having an asthma attack. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; You can, however, choose to stop taking on your mom&#39;s problems, <br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; still supporting her in finding help. I think a thorough medical <br/>\ncheck-up<br/>\n&gt; would be a good first step, and then finding a support system <br/>\nbesides<br/>\n&gt; you, therapy or a group or whatever.

Then she and my stepfather had some issues, that caused her to<br/>\nstart feeling trapped and miserable. Her best friend then moved away, and<br/>\nthey also had a falling out, so then my Mum was also isolated. She felt that<br/>\nI was the only person to whom she could talk about her private matters, and<br/>\nwas probably very depressed for a long time. It was also very repetitive. <br/>\n<br/>\nI finally had to tell her that *I* could not be her therapist any more. I<br/>\nwas not really helping her, other than to be a small valve to let off a tiny<br/>\namount of steam - the mains pressure was never being turned down. I begged<br/>\nher to see a real therapist, or some kind of support group. Eventually she<br/>\ndid, and they both did some marriage counseling therapy also. However that<br/>\nstopped on my stepfather&#39;s timetable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Mum wanted to tell me all about the horrible time she was having in<br/>\ntherapy! I remember her telling me with astonishment, &quot;Do you know that I am<br/>\ndepressed?&quot; Her history in our life has been that she has always sought to<br/>\nmake me and the other people around her responsible for her feelings. The<br/>\nconcept of owning your own feelings eluded her for most of my life, if not<br/>\nher own. I felt burdened by the horror stories of her childhood that she<br/>\ndesired to tell me, in an effort to explain and excuse her own parenting. It<br/>\nhas taken a long time for me to forgive, but having Jayn and working for a<br/>\ndifferent way has helped.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter 22 years of determined misery, it built up inside her so much that her<br/>\nbrain exploded. She had a brain aneurism rupture, fatefully on a Saturday<br/>\nwhen her dh was home. He is also a doctor. She turned septic in the ICU,<br/>\nthen made a miracle recovery (8% chance of living at one time) and continues<br/>\nin rehab and OT. It has been 2 years. She also goes regularly and frequently<br/>\nto a psychiatrist, both to monitor the interaction of her many medications,<br/>\nand to talk. For the first time in her life she has become grateful and<br/>\njoyous most of the time, and loving towards my stepfather. But it took a<br/>\nserious life threatening event to do it. They are looking forward to his<br/>\neventual retirement, so that they can spend more time together.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

It&#39;s great that you were able to chose to get<br/>\nyour life back on track and it worked for you - I did something like that<br/>\nwhen I found out I was pregnant 12 years ago, and decided to pretty much<br/>\nchange everything and get my life on track so I could be a good parent.<br/>\nAt that point my life was pretty messed up, and although I think the<br/>\ntherapy I got helped, the real change was something I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever... I also have had periodic episodes of depression going back 30<br/>\nyears. When I&#39;m depressed, in a clinical sense, no amount of &quot;pep talks&quot;<br/>\nhelp. I cry about traffic, I cry about spilled milk, and I cry about<br/>\nnothing at all. Everything takes an enormous amount of effort - in some<br/>\nways it&#39;s like having a bad flu and trying to drag myself throughthe day.<br/>\nAnd what helps is getting myself onto an antidepressant that works for me<br/>\nand taking it for a week or so, until it starts to kick in and lift the<br/>\nfog. I suppose it is me choosing to take the pills, but if they weren&#39;t<br/>\navailable (and the ones that work for me weren&#39;t until I was in my early<br/>\ntwenties) I wouldn&#39;t be able to just &quot;choose&quot; to be happy, any more than<br/>\nmy diabetic grandpa could &quot;choose&quot; to make more insulin or my dad can<br/>\n&quot;chose&quot; to breathe when having an asthma attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can, however, choose to stop taking on your mom&#39;s problems, while<br/>\nstill supporting her in finding help.

I think she is very depressed - and I know the symptoms well. <br/>\nI also went through a major depression from mid teens through mid <br/>\ntwenties, that no drug or therapy seemed to help.  What finally did <br/>\nhelp was - you guessed it - CHOOSING to be happy, and to take <br/>\nresponsibility for my life.  Since then, I use this technique all the <br/>\ntime, and I feel like there is very little I can&#39;t handle or deal <br/>\nwith.  It IS very empowering.<br/>\nI have tried to explain this idea to my mom, to help her deal with <br/>\nsome of the anxiety and &quot;negative-thinking&quot; issues that she is going <br/>\nthrough, but I don&#39;t think she is truly understanding what I mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does anyone have ideas on how to help her understand that she has <br/>\na choice?

Anyway, I don&#39;t want her to feel like she is being a burden <br/>\nto me, or that we don&#39;t want her here, because we do... so I feel <br/>\nlike its a fine line between trying to help and being critical.  I <br/>\nmean, I CHOSE to let her live here, and I am choosing to make it <br/>\nwork, but that means helping her become whole again, because her <br/>\ndepression is having an impact on our family, particularly my 4yo <br/>\ndd.  That&#39;s another thread though... and I think just a symptom of <br/>\nthis issue.<br/>\nI feel like I give pep talks all the time, which is fine, but it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be helping.

The mom I was talking to was <br/>\nunhappy about things with her three youngish adopted kids, VERY close in age, and <br/>\nshe was feelng trapped and stuck.  I asked her if she had her car in the <br/>\nparking lot.  Yes.  Charge card?  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I told her she didn&#39;t have to go home.  She could go to the airport and <br/>\nfly to Japan.  (Forgot to ask if she had a passport, but it could&#39;ve been <br/>\nHonolulu, then, or Fairbanks, or the other end of Canada.)  I said she could be <br/>\nhaving plastic surgery by Tuesday and never come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtreme?<br/>\n<br/>\nSheesh.  If people have THAT much choice, surely they can choose to have <br/>\ndinner later, or to move the TV to another room.   &quot;We had no choice&quot; is just <br/>\nstarting to get to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople choose not to kill themselves.  That&#39;s usually a good choice.  But <br/>\nchoosing to stay with children means having the responsibility for that choice.  <br/>\nWe chose to babysit a batch of kids today, so four extras.  It will make our <br/>\nwhole day more exciting.   I could have chosen the less exciting, less helpful. <br/>\n I could choose to put them all in the van and drive them to their mom and <br/>\nsay &quot;Changed my mind.&quot;  At any moment, there are choices, and responsibilities, <br/>\nand options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19961,"nextTopicId":19994}}
