I avoid the word &#39;teach&#39; even at my job. Some folks might argue it&#39;s just semantics, but you&#39;d be amazed how the focus of a conversation changes when we discuss how we can help facilitate learning, rather than how can we teach. The shift puts the individual who is learning at the forefront. <br><br>The word &#39;teach&#39; is overused and hackneyed. Most people in the profession don&#39;t agree about what it actually means anyway. Try to define teach and one ends up requiring words that shift the active role to the learner. <br><br>I&#39;m often dissatisfied in my professional work--long story that isn&#39;t relevant here--but I like to think that this shift in language is one contribution I can make to changing the climate in an art department where I&#39;m tasked with helping create an environment in which artists can learn and grow.<br><br></div><div>Thank you, and the many other generous writers here, for helping me to see and think in a better way.<br><br></div>Tori<br></div>Mama to Tolinka and Obi, both 7 yrs<br></div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75216,"nextTopicId":75305}}
