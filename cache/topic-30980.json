It sounds like you are expecting him to decide that learning is a formalized experience where","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-924595927\">You might want to think about what you think learning looks like. It <br/>\nsounds like you are expecting him to decide that learning is a <br/>\nformalized experience where he actively chooses to do something with <br/>\nthe end goal of having obtained knowledge from that experience. It <br/>\nonly looks like that when you are in a formalized learning arena. <br/>\nWild and free learning does not always garner a skill or a finite <br/>\nbody of knowledge at the end of the day. It is like gathering pieces <br/>\nto a bunch of different puzzles all the time. So playing with lego <br/>\nand sitting together with your knees touching and talking about which <br/>\ncolor you need to build whatever structure you are building may get <br/>\nyou into a discussion about being a brick layer or a mason or it may <br/>\nbe a conversation about how you want whatever you are building to <br/>\nlook like or about how many thin bricks you need to balance out a <br/>\nthick brick or maybe just about how the bumps feel under your <br/>\nfingers. And none of that looks like learning, it just looks like two <br/>\npeople absorbed in a shared activity with a little bit of <br/>\nconversation occasionally flowing between them. But there are pieces <br/>\nof a lot of puzzles coming into play in that afternoon. There is a <br/>\nhuge amount of math going on, sorting and fractions and statistics <br/>\n(if you are looking for a single color among many, how many pieces do <br/>\nyou have to look through to find the one--so distribution as well), <br/>\nthere is social learning, sideways conversations, there is trust <br/>\nbeing learnt, the knowledge that a mom is someone who will sit and <br/>\nsort and play and be just with you--a powerful piece of learning. <br/>\nThere is more that goes on in that moment, in that playful, <br/>\nconcentrating moment, than could possibly be going on if you were to <br/>\ndecide to study just one piece of that puzzle. And it builds on <br/>\nitself. The knowledge that your son and you gain in a day of playing <br/>\nand talking and being, it becomes a part of a whole picture of the <br/>\nworld. So, knowing that it takes 4 little bricks to make a whole <br/>\nbrick is a puzzle piece that can be used later when he is thinking <br/>\nabout it taking 4 quarters to make a dollar, maybe. Or seeing the <br/>\ndifferent distribution of bricks in time and space may be something <br/>\nthat can be applied to sorting a completely different order of things <br/>\nat some other point. It all matters. It all is a part of knowledge <br/>\nand thought and awareness and a part who he is and who he is becoming <br/>\njust as it is a part of you and who you are becoming. <br/>\n <br/>\nThere is nothing that a unit study can give you that curiousity and <br/>\nexploring can&#39;t--well except some sort of certificate of knowledge <br/>\ntransfer, I guess. I have two children who have learned without a <br/>\nhanded down design for, well, the eldest for 10 years now. In the <br/>\npast week or so Simon (the eldest) has begun to read. He never once <br/>\nasked to learn to read, he never once approached me with that desire. <br/>\nHe put together all of the tools and pieces to that puzzle in his own <br/>\nway and in his own time and while the puzzle is in no way complete, <br/>\nmy puzzle is in no way complete, he has come to a point where he can <br/>\ninterpret English as a written word. Both he and his sister have a <br/>\nrelationship with numbers that is so intuitive, is so honest, I could <br/>\nnot have trained them for that. And they both recognize that <br/>\nknowledge is not something that is handed down, they recognize that <br/>\nknowledge is something you pick up, it is something that is tasted <br/>\nand felt and defined by you, by the individual. And that is probably <br/>\nthe most important piece of any puzzle that they can carry.<br/>\n <br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi,My son turned 6yo. yesterday.

Take him to the library, because you <br/>\nneed to get some books for yourself.  Take him along to a needlework <br/>\nstore, or an art supply store, or a museum or zoo because you want to <br/>\nsee something there.  If he wants to check out books, or buy some yarn, <br/>\nor get some clay or paints, cool, but you don&#39;t have to make the trip <br/>\nabout what he wants to learn; go because *you* want to (but don&#39;t take <br/>\ntoo long in the needlework store &lt;g&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\n  And most of all --<br/>\n<br/>\nTake both of you to a bookstore that carries Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;The Book of <br/>\nLearning and Forgetting,&quot; buy a copy for yourself, and a book of your <br/>\nson&#39;s choosing, and read together.  Before you do anything like worry <br/>\nor push or fret, read that book.<br/>\n<br/>\nNancy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":212831948,"authorName":"halfshadow1","from":"&quot;halfshadow1&quot; &lt;halfshadow1@...&gt;","profile":"halfshadow1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"it&#39;s official/i&#39;m feeling Inactive as his facilitator","postDate":"1191706994","msgId":30980,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZlOHZoaStqOTI3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30981,"prevInTime":30979,"nextInTime":30981,"topicId":30980,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi,My son turned 6yo. yesterday.
