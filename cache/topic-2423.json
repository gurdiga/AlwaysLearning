There is a lot to be said for giving free rein to the <br/>\nperson who HAS been willing to examine their ideas and research and observe <br/>\nand become REALLY convinced of something. Somebody who won&#39;t do that is <br/>\nreally overly controlling. And, slowly, over the years, my dh has absorbed it <br/>\nby osmosis. Or maybe he actually picked up something from all those times he <br/>\nfell asleep listening to me talk about it? Nah, it is because the kids are <br/>\ngrowing up and are OBVIOUSLY thoughtful and intelligent and competent and <br/>\nfilled with passion and enthusiasm and goals and he&#39;s proud of them. I&#39;m <br/>\npretty sure he wonders sometimes if they wouldn&#39;t have turned out &quot;better&quot; <br/>\n(read that as wanting to major in pre-med instead of art in college) if <br/>\nthey&#39;d been &quot;schooled&quot; at home or in an institution or at least been more <br/>\n&#39;channelled&#39; into more &#39;serious&#39; study. But that&#39;s okay - he can wonder - as <br/>\nlong as he still supports them and loves them and keeps his own doubts to <br/>\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2422,"nextTopicId":2425}}
