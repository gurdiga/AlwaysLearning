The newsgroups were<br/>\nprobably a very different culture from AOL but I thought they were great!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that Yahoo has been useful for homeschoolers. I also think it can <br/>\nlead to a Balkanization of homeschoolers.  It&#39;s so easy when the list isn&#39;t<br/>\njust how you want it to go off in a huff and start a new list.

Debbie Mitchell ran it and it was an off-shoot of <br/>\nthe UL (unschooler&#39;s list) because some of the people on the UC were <br/>\nvery direct and asked pointed questions and called people on their BS <br/>\nand were not welcome by the administrator of the UL.  I was quite content <br/>\nthere for some time, if you can call it being content to be examining a lot of<br/>\nbeliefs about parening and living.  Then a lot of new people came in and <br/>\ndecided that the old-guard weren&#39;t nice enough.  In the ensuing debate the <br/>\nlist died.
