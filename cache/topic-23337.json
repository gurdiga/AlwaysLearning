If so, I would really appreciate it if you could forward our <br/>\ncontact details to those who may be interested in participating in the series. <br/>\nWould there also be space for a brief mention in an e-mail newsletter, or <br/>\neven on your website?<br/>\n<br/>\n My contact details are 011 44 207 251 6966 (UK), or 1 323 692 3038 (US), or <br/>\nyou can e-mail me on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jamescm99@...\">jamescm99@...</a> or <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:james.christiemiller@...\">james.christiemiller@...</a> - rather boringly, our server is down right now, so the hotmail address is <br/>\nbest for the short term....<br/>\n<br/>\n Many thanks for your time  - I look forward to hearing from you soon.
