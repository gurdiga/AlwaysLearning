I didn&#39;t sleep well last night, just feeling uneasy about<br/>\n  today.  Talk about premonitions.<br/>\n<br/>\n  My car wouldn&#39;t start this morning before church.  I had scads of stuff to<br/>\n  bring to church, because there were extra choir rehearsals and baseball<br/>\n  practice for my son, and all that.  No way I was going to take the train.<br/>\n  So I tracked down my neighbor to jump it.  Fortunately, it appears that the<br/>\n  battery was the only problem, because is has run fine since.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Ok, so long story short, church started at 9:45, and I left to go home at<br/>\n  4:15.  Had something to drop off at someone&#39;s house and found them fine.<br/>\n  Got lost on the way home.  This is not unusual for me in Germany, the roads<br/>\n  are former cow paths and the cows had no sense of direction.  It takes an<br/>\n  hour to drive the 20 km home, but I arrive.  Finally.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Relax.  Make popcorn, read the paper and a few emails.  Remember I need to<br/>\n  call a friend about getting together on Tuesday.  Her phone rings once, and<br/>\n  Tim is shrieking in pain.  So I hang up, and look.  He has a hand over his<br/>\n  eye, and there&#39;s blood down the fingers and the face.  Yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The cat scratched him, and she managed to catch his eye.  So after I mop him<br/>\n  up enough to puzzle out what&#39;s going on, it appears that there is a cut on<br/>\n  the center inside of the lower lid.  So off we go to the German hospital.<br/>\n  (No military hospital here or anywhere near here.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now, you must understand that German hospitals are just not like American<br/>\n  hospitals.  I walk in the front door (there&#39;s no emergency entrance) and the<br/>\n  receptionist speaks no English, and my German is mediocre at the best of<br/>\n  times.  She points, and we head off.  And get lost.  In the hospital.  Miles<br/>\n  of empty corridors.  This is where I lost it.  Finally, a nurse appears and<br/>\n  magically, she speaks enough English to puzzle out the problem, and leads me<br/>\n  to where I need to be.  It&#39;s nowhere near where the receptionist pointed, so<br/>\n  far as I can tell. <br/>\n<br/>\n  After ten minutes discussion about who will pay for this, I finally convince<br/>\n  the doctor to look at my son&#39;s eye.  I am ready to lose it again, but in<br/>\n  anger this time.  Let&#39;s talk money after we deal with a scared, hurting<br/>\n  child, okay?  GRRRRRRRRRR!<br/>\n<br/>\n  This doctor can tell me that he does not need stitches.  (Brilliant,<br/>\n  Sherlock.  Even *I* had guessed that.)  So we must see the opthomologist.<br/>\n  Miraculously, there is one working on a Sunday night.  In the town 30 km up<br/>\n  the road.  And like any good doctor, we arrive early and she&#39;s running late.<br/>\n  Tim is hungry, tierd, scared, and wants to go home.  Me too, but we really<br/>\n  do need to see this doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\n  After the &quot;who&#39;s going pay&quot; song and dance again, she turns out to be quite<br/>\n  nice, does a very good exam of his eye.  The cornea is NOT scratched, to my<br/>\n  great relief, and the cut will heal on its own.  She gives us an antiboitic,<br/>\n  bandages the eye, and home we go.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m so relieved that he&#39;s okay, but still so wound up inside about a system<br/>\n  that seems so much more interested in money than people.  I know the<br/>\n  military is terribly slow about paying their bills.  I am very sorry for<br/>\n  that, and I was happy to pay the bills tonight and will bill the insurance<br/>\n  myself.  But please, help my son first!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So somebody, please, say something calming.  Soon.  Thank you!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  brenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!

I didn&#39;t sleep well last night, just feeling uneasy about<br/>\ntoday.  Talk about premonitions.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy car wouldn&#39;t start this morning before church.  I had scads of stuff to<br/>\nbring to church, because there were extra choir rehearsals and baseball<br/>\npractice for my son, and all that.  No way I was going to take the train.<br/>\nSo I tracked down my neighbor to jump it.  Fortunately, it appears that the<br/>\nbattery was the only problem, because is has run fine since.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so long story short, church started at 9:45, and I left to go home at<br/>\n4:15.  Had something to drop off at someone&#39;s house and found them fine.<br/>\nGot lost on the way home.  This is not unusual for me in Germany, the roads<br/>\nare former cow paths and the cows had no sense of direction.  It takes an<br/>\nhour to drive the 20 km home, but I arrive.  Finally.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelax.  Make popcorn, read the paper and a few emails.  Remember I need to<br/>\ncall a friend about getting together on Tuesday.  Her phone rings once, and<br/>\nTim is shrieking in pain.  So I hang up, and look.  He has a hand over his<br/>\neye, and there&#39;s blood down the fingers and the face.  Yikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cat scratched him, and she managed to catch his eye.  So after I mop him<br/>\nup enough to puzzle out what&#39;s going on, it appears that there is a cut on<br/>\nthe center inside of the lower lid.  So off we go to the German hospital.<br/>\n(No military hospital here or anywhere near here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you must understand that German hospitals are just not like American<br/>\nhospitals.  I walk in the front door (there&#39;s no emergency entrance) and the<br/>\nreceptionist speaks no English, and my German is mediocre at the best of<br/>\ntimes.  She points, and we head off.  And get lost.  In the hospital.  Miles<br/>\nof empty corridors.  This is where I lost it.  Finally, a nurse appears and<br/>\nmagically, she speaks enough English to puzzle out the problem, and leads me<br/>\nto where I need to be.  It&#39;s nowhere near where the receptionist pointed, so<br/>\nfar as I can tell. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter ten minutes discussion about who will pay for this, I finally convince<br/>\nthe doctor to look at my son&#39;s eye.  I am ready to lose it again, but in<br/>\nanger this time.  Let&#39;s talk money after we deal with a scared, hurting<br/>\nchild, okay?  GRRRRRRRRRR!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doctor can tell me that he does not need stitches.  (Brilliant,<br/>\nSherlock.  Even *I* had guessed that.)  So we must see the opthomologist.<br/>\nMiraculously, there is one working on a Sunday night.  In the town 30 km up<br/>\nthe road.  And like any good doctor, we arrive early and she&#39;s running late.<br/>\nTim is hungry, tierd, scared, and wants to go home.  Me too, but we really<br/>\ndo need to see this doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the &quot;who&#39;s going pay&quot; song and dance again, she turns out to be quite<br/>\nnice, does a very good exam of his eye.  The cornea is NOT scratched, to my<br/>\ngreat relief, and the cut will heal on its own.  She gives us an antiboitic,<br/>\nbandages the eye, and home we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so relieved that he&#39;s okay, but still so wound up inside about a system<br/>\nthat seems so much more interested in money than people.  I know the<br/>\nmilitary is terribly slow about paying their bills.  I am very sorry for<br/>\nthat, and I was happy to pay the bills tonight and will bill the insurance<br/>\nmyself.  But please, help my son first!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo somebody, please, say something calming.  Soon.  Thank you!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14839,"nextTopicId":14825}}
