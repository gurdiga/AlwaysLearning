Sometimes she asks me to watch tv/movies with her and I make the time for her. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a passage from a longer poem that La Leche League quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleaning and scrubbing can wait till tomorrow<br/>\nBut children grow up as I’ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>\nSo quiet down cobwebs; Dust go to sleep!<br/>\nI’m nursing my baby and babies don’t keep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was published in the U.S. (Ladies&#39; Home Journal) in 1958, so the odds are that the baby was bottle-fed.  La Leche League used the beautiful ending, and changed &quot;rocking&quot; to &quot;nursing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Song for a Fifth Child&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMother, O Mother, come shake out your cloth,<br/>\nEmpty the dustpan, poison the moth,<br/>\nHang out the washing, make up the bed,<br/>\nSew on a button and butter the bread.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is the mother whose house is so shocking?<br/>\nShe’s up in the nursery, blissfully rocking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I’ve grown as shiftless as Little Boy Blue,<br/>\nLullabye, rockabye, lullabye loo.<br/>\nDishes are waiting and bills are past due<br/>\nPat-a-cake, darling, and peek, peekaboo<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shopping’s not done and there’s nothing for stew<br/>\nAnd out in the yard there’s a hullabaloo<br/>\nBut I’m playing Kanga and this is my Roo<br/>\nLook! Aren’t his eyes the most wonderful hue?<br/>\nLullabye, rockaby lullabye loo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleaning and scrubbing can wait till tomorrow<br/>\nBut children grow up as I’ve learned to my sorrow.<br/>\nSo quiet down cobwebs; Dust go to sleep!<br/>\nI’m rocking my baby and babies don’t keep.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ruth Hulbert Hamilton<br/>\n<br/>\nMost families hurry their babies to grow up enough to leave at four or five to go to school. Unschoolers can rock their children as long as the children want to be home.  Our children don&#39;t need to hear people saying &quot;You&#39;re not old enough to do that,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;re too old to do that.&quot;  I had that message a thousand times, about what I was wearing, doing, singing, reading, liking, saying, the way I was sitting, the games I enjoyed.  My children were spared that, and made TEN thousand decisions without the self-conscious thought of &quot;what will the others think?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even though the poem is about babies, with unschooling, with kids at home, keep in mind that a five year old is never five for more than a year.  When your last nine-year-old turns ten, you no longer have a young child with a single-digit birthday.  My third teenager turned twenty this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only do babies not keep, neither do toddlers, children, or teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359600026,"authorName":"maryann","from":"&quot;maryann&quot; &lt;maryannh@...&gt;","profile":"maryannhh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: School in books and media for kids...","postDate":"1323784814","msgId":64377,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpjN2xwZStvZjZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMjM2MTczMDcuNDk5NjYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMTQxNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":64324,"nextInTopic":64438,"prevInTime":64376,"nextInTime":64378,"topicId":64300,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

We could do that!&quot;  And I get the stuff we need to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots and lots of incidences of negative things about school in shows, even in the ones trying to get kids to see it as fun.  We saw an episode of Calliou the other day and it was all about him going to school for a day and how fun it was.  But the narrator also said things like, &#39;Calliou wanted to keep playing blocks, but Miss so-and-so said it was clean up time.&#39;  So I had an opening to point out that it was true that in school they had certain times for certain things and the kids had to follow that. (Then we played blocks. ;) Many stories have a snippet of the negativity of school.  We watched some show that included a scene where the boy&#39;s dog ran away and he suddenly saw it outside his school window, and they showed him nervously sitting there for what seemed like forever.  So I got to explain that at school, kids would not usually be allowed to just get up and go outside.  My boy was shocked about why the kid didn&#39;t jump up and go save his dog!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis fall my kids had chickenpox, and I got some books from the library for us to read about it.  There were some nonfiction and some fiction.  Annoyingly, the fiction was all school-related, and I was disappointed.  But it turned out that the one newest one was the only one that said something to the effects of &quot;It was so boring because I couldn&#39;t go to school.&quot;  and then, &quot;Yay, after a week, I finally got to go back to school!&quot;  The others (including an Arthur one) showed the kids spotty and itching and having fun while being glad to miss school.  One in which the girl was really sick and feeling terrible, even showed her brother pay her a dime to breathe on him so he could get sick and miss school too.  So I had an opening to talk about how some kids even Fake being sick to get to miss school.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t seek out stories or shows about school because it&#39;s not an interest of my children.  But when we happen upon them, there is almost always a way to use it to support my child&#39;s interests (in being free to have fun and learn and be at home with his family a lot).  I try hard to skip past any feelings I may have of &quot;Oh no, what if this makes him want to go to school.&quot; and look at it through his eyes.  There ARE fun things about school, and I don&#39;t want my kids to miss out on those or even WORRY that they are missing out on those.  I&#39;m trying to do that by giving it to them, rather than hiding it from them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI look for books and shows and toys and places to go that I think my kids would enjoy.  And, as nice as preschool may sound in some stories, there are A LOT of fun stories about a lot of other things too.  I would make sure you find books about fun things you and your daughter can/will actually do, so the school ones aren&#39;t the most exciting thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaryann<br/>\nDS 5 1/2, DD 2</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: School in books and media for kids...","postDate":"1323638513","msgId":64324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFCNTAwMzRDLTZENDMtNDA0Qy04MzJDLTYyOTM4NUEzQ0ZBMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpjMzY4bitpdGltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpjMzY4bitpdGltQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64322,"nextInTopic":64377,"prevInTime":64323,"nextInTime":64325,"topicId":64300,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=I m new to the list as well and am still figuring out how it works, but isn t this precisely the sort of thing that is encouraged here?

Thanks! --<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t live like school doesn&#39;t exist.  Some of my kids friends are in school, some aren&#39;t.  When they were younger and some friends were in daycare, I explained what daycare was (when we&#39;d pass one, or when they wanted to know where their friends were), and tell them about how sometimes two parents work, or parents want to do other things during the day, and that they were very lucky that daddy could make enough money for mommy to be with them during the day.  And then I&#39;d list all the cool things that we did during the day that they wouldn&#39;t get to do in daycare.  School hasn&#39;t come up in the same way, perhaps because the old explanation is still working for my daughter, 5.5 years old now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think stories about school in books are great, actually.  In some books, its a great experience, with an awesome teacher!  Magic Schoolbus stories... they love those ones a lot. Ms. Frizzle is fun... the teacherly schooly stuff is fairly minimal.  Its all about adventure and learning through experience, and often begins because a kid asks a question about something (so somewhat interest-led learning).  In other books where school is featured, sometimes they show the not-so-pleasant stuff... which I think is also good.  Its realistic and gives my kids an idea of another facet of school.  The less mysterious school is, the more they can choose to go or not to go based on realistic ideas instead of wondering all the time.   But we really can&#39;t pretend it doesn&#39;t exist.  Where do all those children boarding the school bus disappear each morning to?  That would be hard to explain away.<br/>\n<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: School in books and media for kids...","postDate":"1323609521","msgId":64303,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpjMmFqaCs0YWhhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpjMWxwaitmcjI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64302,"nextInTopic":64304,"prevInTime":64302,"nextInTime":64304,"topicId":64300,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not specifically in relation to school (my daughter did go to school), but any ideas that were contrary to what I believed in.  The story books I read to my baby and toddler daughter typically included ideas about parenting and children that I disagreed with and I omitted phrases and sentences as it suited me in order to avoid sharing them.  If it was necessary to make something up for the story to make sense, I made something up.  As my daughter encountered the literary tastes of other children, our lives expanded into those areas and that was fine as far as I was concerned.  I wouldn&#39;t have looked at My Little Pony books before my daughter discovered them but after she did and wanted me to read those stories to her, I was happy to do so because she enjoyed the stories.  As my daughter learned to read herself, she read the books she chose and whatever was on the page.  As it should be, in my view.  The phase in the beginning when I censored the books I was reading to her wasn&#39;t intended to prevent her from finding things out or following her interests; it was an opportunity to influence that I took advantage of because I could. <br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196677035,"authorName":"Tina Tarbutton","from":"Tina Tarbutton &lt;tina.tarbutton@...&gt;","profile":"dravensmomhome","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] School in books and media for kids...","postDate":"1323604070","msgId":64302,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUDlOWEp2TCt0cU9RWkJ3MlkxdllUal85a1dVPWlrQ3JGQkZXNlRHTU80UnFHMXdWd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpjMWxwaitmcjI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpjMWxwaitmcjI2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64300,"nextInTopic":64303,"prevInTime":64301,"nextInTime":64303,"topicId":64300,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
