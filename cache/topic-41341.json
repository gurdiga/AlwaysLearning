Sharing what a person knows about reading<br/>\nis not usually anything like sharing what a person knows about making<br/>\nsomething, where if the person wanting to know the information has hands<br/>\nand/or a mind that works differently from the one instructing, such a<br/>\ndifference is respected and accommodated for with time for the learner to<br/>\nmake minor adjustments or time to figure out on their own how to make the<br/>\nprocess work for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nComing from an art background, I have seen that over and over again.  There<br/>\nare grad assistants/instructors/professors/etc who instruct in art (in Pam&#39;s<br/>\nsense of the word) as opposed to those who prefer to teach art.  Many times<br/>\npeople who hope to teach art invariably do so without respect for<br/>\ndifferences and aren&#39;t as successful in transferring the skills they have to<br/>\nothers.  It happens in art as well as other types of classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think reading is a particularly difficult skill to give instruction in<br/>\nbecause the process is so much in the head, and adjustments take much longer<br/>\nbecause the feedback from the process of learning reading takes longer.<br/>\nOther things have more immediate feedback and results like ballet, karate,<br/>\nart, sewing, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 1/12/09, Pamela Sorooshian &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:pamsoroosh@...\">pamsoroosh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jan 12, 2009, at 4:10 PM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think teachers in public school have &quot;teachings.&quot;  They&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; offering technical and neutral info too, very rarely of their own<br/>\n&gt; &gt; discovery or creation.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   I was thinking that school teachings come down from &quot;on high&quot; in the<br/>\n&gt; form of state standards.

Instruction is &quot;useful&quot; -  <br/>\ninstructions help me do things I want to do. Instruction is  <br/>\nspecifically for a purpose and it&#39;s use is initiated and can be  <br/>\nterminated by the learner. When instructions come with my new  <br/>\ncomputer, I can utilize those instructions in the way they work for  <br/>\nme. If I want to learn ballet, I can watch instructional videos, read  <br/>\ninstructional books, or maybe get instruction in a ballet class.

Even piano teachers, for example, very often  <br/>\nthink THEY should be totally in charge of what the student learns and  <br/>\nhow they learn it - it is rare to find a piano teacher who will simply  <br/>\nhelp a student learn the way they want to learn and what they want to  <br/>\nlearn. At least we can shop around for piano teachers, though. If mom  <br/>\ndecides to be a teacher, the kids can&#39;t shop around to find another  <br/>\none who will do things their way.

I <br/>\nread to her, she peruses books on her own, gets a kick out of closed-<br/>\ncaptioning (which we don&#39;t have at home - she sees it occasionally in <br/>\nrestaurants, stores, etc.), and plays games on her Leapster, her <br/>\nVtech computer, and on websites like nickjr.com, pbskids.org, and <br/>\nDisney.  She got some writing workbooks for Christmas & it was like <br/>\ncandy for her - she couldn&#39;t seem to get enough.  She seemed like she <br/>\nreally was hungry for it, so one day I asked her if she wanted me to <br/>\n(cringe) teach her to read, and she excitedly said yes.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI learned to read by using Phonics, and can see some benefit to using <br/>\nsome of the ideas, but remember being really confused by words like <br/>\n*women*.  So - my question is, does an unschooling family *teach* one <br/>\nof its members to read?  Do I just keep reading to her like I&#39;ve been <br/>\ndoing, pointing out words on signs, etc., or since she is asking for <br/>\nguidance, where to I go from here?  I know that this group is not <br/>\nabout teaching, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking here.  I don&#39;t want to *do* <br/>\nschool.  But I want her help feed her hunger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have little doubt that this has been discussed here before, so if <br/>\nany of you can point me toward a related thread, I&#39;d appreciate it.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41456,"nextTopicId":41426}}
