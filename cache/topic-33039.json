Me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI heard Marty singing in a strong falsetto, and he was singing &quot;Don&#39;t  <br/>\nStop Believing.&quot;  I was on my way upstairs anyway, so I called up  <br/>\nahead of myself, &quot;Holly, your voice is getting lower!&quot;  She said  <br/>\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;  I said (getting closer to her room) &quot;And I like your falsetto.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBy then I was in the hallway and could see Marty, who had turned and  <br/>\nwas laughing silently because he knew I was actually telling him he  <br/>\nwas sounding  &quot;like a leetle girl.&quot;<br/>\nBut he also knew Holly wasn&#39;t getting it, and she said &quot;I wasn&#39;t  <br/>\nsinging, that was Marty.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew that.  Marty knew I knew.  Holly was busy with MySpace and not  <br/>\npaying much attention to either of us, so Marty said (from the other  <br/>\nroom; they couldn&#39;t see each other though I could see both of them),  <br/>\n&quot;Holly, it&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re cute.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly said, &quot;What?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI leaned into Holly&#39;s room and said mock-seriously, &quot;That was all a  <br/>\njoke, from the very beginning.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe looked up at me and blinked and said, &quot;It&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m cute.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":33034,"nextTopicId":32919}}
