They&#39;ll put fruit punch, cola, root beer, sprite, orange soda and maybe diet all together in the cup. Dr. Pepper if they have it. Sometimes they end up with a nice combo, other times they decide it&#39;s revolting, and modify it next time &quot;Too much Dr. Pepper&quot; or &quot;not enough sprite&quot;. We never call it science, but they do say they&#39;re experimenting. It&#39;s a pretty cool, inexpensive bit of fun. <br/>\nI used to have a perfume lab in my room as a kid. I took (borrowed) all my mothers perfumes, bottles of water, baby powder, liquid soap, maybe some soy or something too, and mix them all together. I&#39;d put them in fancy bottles and bring them down for my mom to try behind her ears. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 8/20/12, keetry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keetry@...\">keetry@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: keetry &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:keetry@...\">keetry@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;Science Experiments&quot;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, August 20, 2012, 12:29 PM<br/>\n<br/>\nOur latest science has been discovering very large spiders building webs at our back door and on our front porch that we thought might be brown widows. My husband caught the first one and gave it to another homeschooler in our neighborhood who loves spiders. We spent time trying to identify it on the internet. I think I finally figured out that it&#39;s a nondangerous orb weaver rather than any kind of widow spider. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also found either a real black widow or a false widow in a drain pipe. My 21 year old found a dead dragonfly outside. It was a big as his palm! He brought it inside and put it on the kitchen table for everyone to examine. I love that my kids think to do that rather than just smooshing it or throwing it away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boys also collected tadpoles from the ditch next to our house and put them in an aquarium we have. We&#39;re hoping they&#39;ll survive and change into frogs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got one of those chemistry kits. It was fun for a day and then not so much. I think, like Sandra said, that was because it&#39;s demonstrations rather than real experiments and my kids enjoy discovering their own things much more. I have several science experiment books using every day household items but I&#39;ve found that we don&#39;t have most of the &quot;common&quot; household items needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

Things that you obviously know about<br/>\nbut are demonstrating can be science as well if he is thinking about the<br/>\noutcome or if he is thinking about the explanation behind it. The<br/>\nhelicopter for example, why does it rise? And tada that is science, angle<br/>\nthe blades differently and it won&#39;t rise, you have now tested your<br/>\nhypothesis. Asking what happens if you cut the string on the tin can phone<br/>\nis science, you cut the string and demonstrate that the string vibrates and<br/>\ncarries sound. Allowing him to question what might happen allows him to<br/>\ncreate a hypothesis, and thus you are using and demonstrating the<br/>\nscientific method. You can get all geeky if you want with him, a lab<br/>\nnotebook, writing down steps, coming up with a hypothesis, etc. if that&#39;s<br/>\nwhat he is seeking, esp since it is before Halloween finding a lab coat<br/>\nshould be easy! Even when you know the answer it is still an experiment,<br/>\nadding the question of why or how, and testing it turns into the method.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo obviously, I disagree that it isn&#39;t an experiment if the answer is<br/>\nknown, experimentation is defined as &quot;A scientific procedure undertaken to<br/>\nmake a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Mon, Aug 20, 2012 at 12:37 PM, Shauna Reisewitz &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:shaunareisewitz@...\">shaunareisewitz@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; What about getting  a chemistry set for &quot;older kids&quot;  ? he might find<br/>\n&gt; something like that a little more satisfactory.

We would bury the end of the hose, built a mountain over it, and then turn the water on, low.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon the water would start leaking out, somewhere, but we never knew where until it came.  Then we all tried to stop the &quot;lava&quot; by putting more sand on that place, which would cause it to &quot;erupt&quot; somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat never ceased to be fun. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny kind of digging and water play can be fun, I think, but not all families have the option.  Some live in apartments or flats, don&#39;t own their own shovels or dirt.  Beaches are cool, but you can&#39;t get the hose out there, or save what you&#39;ve created.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust last week I sprouted seeds, in the house, because my three compost bins didn&#39;t have STUFF in them.  The worms were up near the surface, and had made nice dirt of all we had put in there, and it&#39;s too early in the year to give them fallen leaves.   I foundsome popcorn in a cloth bad we had bought in South Dakota.  We were in South Dakota that same trip when I learned the platypus was a mammal (mentioned in another thread today), so it was OLD.   I popped some, and most of it popped, but it was a little boring, so I thought I would sprout it and give the sprouts to my worms.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I thought I should sprout other stuff.  Pinto beans and bird seed (from the bird-feeding bucket up by the deck, where we feed sparrows and doves) went into the water.  After I soaked them all for a day, I put them in colanders (being a packrat and collector, I have five) and I rinsed them several times a day.  Now they&#39;re out, planted in the compost piles and the &quot;bird seed&quot; is up and getting leaves.  The corn has sprouted up through the dirt just yesterday and this morning, and beans will eventually.  I waited until about 1/3 of the seeds had a first white sprout sticking out before I planted them all, and I&#39;m watering them a few times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s August.  I&#39;m not going to grow any mature plants, but I WILL succeed in giving the worms something new to eat. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was cheap and fun.  If you have lentils, those will sprout, too.  Or I guess you could buy sprouts and the grocery store and put them in dirt and grown their mama-plants, and if you get tired of them, eat them or give them to the compost pile at your house or your neighbor&#39;s.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246186758,"authorName":"Sarah","from":"&quot;Sarah&quot; &lt;yahoo@...&gt;","profile":"sarahlexis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: &quot;Science Experiments&quot;","postDate":"1345472638","msgId":68698,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGswdGg5dSs5bWluQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGswdDg1aCtraXE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68694,"nextInTopic":68701,"prevInTime":68697,"nextInTime":68699,"topicId":68687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"When my boys (7,5 and 1) want to do science experiments they want test-tubes and a few different coloured waters, with pipettes, stirrers, syringes, beakers","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1462481316\">When my boys (7,5 and 1) want to do &#39;science experiments&#39; they want test-tubes and a few different coloured waters, with pipettes, stirrers, syringes, beakers and funnels.

It&#39;s not just that I love language more than I love kitchen-table &quot;science,&quot; but it might be worth pointing out (gently, not in a fun-squashing way) that those things are demonstrations, and not experiments.  The answer is already known.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking fake blood and fake scars (those recipes are easy to find) is sciency for real, because you could change the colors and ingredients, and it&#39;s not expensive, and you can put it on you (or a tile wall near a bathroom---if you own the home, don&#39;t risk discoloring rental-home grout) and take photos of it and then wash it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nCounting and photographing wildlife is science.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDigging down (if you own your yard and it&#39;s not landscaped wall to wall) is science.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a compost pile and looking, as you turn it or mix it, to see what&#39;s rotting fast and what&#39;s going more slowly is science.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagnets and what will stick....<br/>\nbending a wire back and forth until it breaks...<br/>\nfolding paper to tear, and seeing that it tears more easily if you fold it back and forth, run a fingernail down it or lick the fold...<br/>\n<br/>\nPam Sorooshian told us about something very cool with milk and dish soap.

Finn (6) does sometimes like an actual science experiment, especially if it&#39;s something we&#39;ve discovered on youtube together (like volcanoes or elephant toothpaste etc); the more dramatic the better, which sometimes doesn&#39;t happen with the real experiments. You can pick up used chemistry kits and labcoats on ebay for relatively little, with test tubes and flasks etc, with some coloured solutions and some dry ice maybe, it could look pretty good. You could maybe see if he just wanted to &#39;make potions&#39; (My two love doing this with stuff from the kitchen cupboards and then seeing what it tastes/smells like) or you could do some of the real experiments if that was what he was interested in.

One of them had different chemicals that we could combine and see the different reactions. I think we got a couple of them from the local hobby shop. You can also get them off of Amazon by doing a search on “science kit”. Maybe you could look through the results on Amazon with your son to see if there is a kit that looks particularly interesting. Something else to consider is getting a microscope. We used to do lots of looking at stuff under the microscope. If she got a cut, we would prepare a slide with the blood so she could see what her blood looked like under the microscope. We did it with her hair and anything else we could think of. We also found some kits without the chemicals at the local thrift store. <br/>\nAnother idea is YouTube videos. My 8 year old found the coolest YouTube channel called Slomoguys. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/theslowmoguys?feature=results_main\">http://www.youtube.com/user/theslowmoguys?feature=results_main</a>  They do science experiments and record normal stuff like popping popcorn and then slow it down so that you can see how it looks in extreme slow motion. After watching the popcorn pop in slow motion, we got a different popcorn popper so the girls could watch popcorn up close as it pops. <br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Science Experiments&quot;","postDate":"1345466114","msgId":68690,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjEwMS1XMjAxQTQzQzE0Q0Q1RTNDNDlCNzg5QUI3QjkwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGswdDg1aCtraXE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGswdDg1aCtraXE1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68688,"nextInTopic":68691,"prevInTime":68689,"nextInTime":68691,"topicId":68687,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is it chemistry type of experiments he s looking for?
