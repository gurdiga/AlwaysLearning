As expected, we got a lot of wise <br/>\nand wonderful information...great stuff for pondering over, and some <br/>\nabsolutely hilarious stuff on the crickets!

It seems that it is <br/>\nsimply a mind shift that has to take place. (Our shift needed a shove <br/>\nfrom you all). The movie ratings info. all makes perfect sense and was <br/>\nvery helpful. A friend is taking the fire belly toad, the turtles are <br/>\ngetting too big and heading to their pond of origin, and the crickets <br/>\nare staying in our dd&#39;s closet now.  (I have to add, our 1000 crickets <br/>\nwere delivered yesterday, and sitting in their box in the house till I <br/>\ngot home with the kids to put them in their bin, when I got a panic <br/>\ncall from my dh that there was a hole in the box and they were pouring <br/>\nout into the house!  There must be something Karmic here!?  The vacuum <br/>\ngot a lot of use!)
