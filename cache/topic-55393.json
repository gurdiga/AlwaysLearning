They get a feel of how that feels, what other unschooled teens are like and with the added bonus of meeting new people that could possibly be free to hang out after the conference.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe with your daughter and be her friend during the conference, help her find peace while there.  What happens sometimes, is that newer to unschooling parents will kind of let their kids go and do and be without much feedback and interaction.  That&#39;s really typical of what schooled parents do with their schooled kids, there is a disconnect between parent and child, something that isn&#39;t the case with unschooled kids that haven&#39;t just been pulled out of school.  Perhaps, think of the conference as something, a thing, that you can bond together with your kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that&#39;s not the case for you and your teen, then go and have fun and be present and be her friend as needed.  If there is a disconnect, like what is so typical, be even more aware of that and help to head of trouble as needed while still allowing for a bit of freedom.  The social dynamics of unschooled teens is so very different than that of schooled teens.  For the most part, unschooled teens are much more accepting of each other, even if they aren&#39;t best buddies. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling conferences and teenagers","postDate":"1277783034","msgId":55446,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDMjk2QkY5LjIwMzA1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PGkwYm5uMytiOG43QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkwYm5uMytiOG43QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55445,"nextInTopic":55447,"prevInTime":55445,"nextInTime":55447,"topicId":55393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

There are a whole lot <br/>\nof teens - more than a hundred, maybe double that, I don&#39;t really know, <br/>\nand it is a really good first conference because there are more <br/>\norganized activities for teens than at other conferences and so it is <br/>\neasier for new teens to find things to do and meet people, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to consider is that the teens have tremendous freedom - it <br/>\nisn&#39;t like school where adults are herding them around and keeping an <br/>\neye on them. They go where they want and do what they want. We trust <br/>\nthem not to do crazy or stupid things. Sometimes a kid can&#39;t handle that <br/>\nkind of freedom without taking advantage of it by behaving <br/>\nirresponsibly. I don&#39;t think that problem is limited to schooled kids <br/>\neven though they are more prone to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often suggest people bring their teens to the HSC Conference when <br/>\nthey&#39;ve just started unschooling. I think it is very inspiring for the <br/>\nteens and super supportive for them to discover all this big crowd of <br/>\nother unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bigger problem that I see is that it appears to new teens like <br/>\neverybody else already knows each other and it can seem really hard to <br/>\nsort of break in to a new group. Lots of these kids have been going to <br/>\nconference since they were little and they get very excited to see each <br/>\nother and they don&#39;t think about the new kids.

We have a group of 25 teens who meet throughout the year and <br/>\ncome up with a lot of their own ideas and sessions. They plan and <br/>\norganize the themed dances every night - and that&#39;s a big draw for some <br/>\nkids, but not for all. My kids always visit the dances just a bit, but <br/>\ndon&#39;t get into them much.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you look at this list and just scroll through it, check the ones that <br/>\nsay &quot;teen.&quot;   Teens are also welcome at all the other sessions, too. <br/>\nThere are also things like the art deck (a deck overlooking the lake <br/>\nwith big tables of art supplies available) and the game deck (lots of <br/>\nyu-gi-oh and magic, the gathering, and other game playing going on there <br/>\nat all times). There is a papercraft salon - a room dedicated to <br/>\npapercrafts like ATCs and more and a fiber-crafts salon. There is also <br/>\nthe super popular &quot;swap-o-rama-rama&quot; -- piles and piles of used clothing <br/>\nand accessories like ribbons and beads. The teens LOVE this - everybody <br/>\npicks out clothing and embellishes it. There are people will sewing <br/>\nmachines and supplies and expertise to help us create what we can imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hscconference.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/hsc2010workshops.pdf\">http://www.hscconference.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/hsc2010workshops.pdf</a><br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":276731379,"authorName":"Robin Bentley","from":"Robin Bentley &lt;robin.bentley@...&gt;","profile":"seyyala","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling conferences and teenagers","postDate":"1277746350","msgId":55404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyRjNCNzNCLTY0NTYtNEEwRi1CODE0LTFCMzM0Q0YxOTc4M0Bjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGkwYTY3NCs4NmZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkwYTY3NCs4NmZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55397,"nextInTopic":55410,"prevInTime":55403,"nextInTime":55405,"topicId":55393,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
