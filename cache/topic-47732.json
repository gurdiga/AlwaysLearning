What would happen if the paint job had not turned out the way you intended?  Shortly after we moved into our current home, the kids were 6, 8 and 13.  They helped paint nearly all the walls in our house.  The paint colors have changed several times over the years except in my bathroom.  My youngest dd painted around the tub, near the baseboards, and as far up the door frame as she could reach.  The paint does not look like a professional did it, and it never occurred to me that it should.  I smile when I&#39;m in the tub and see the paint line all over in some places.  It reminds of a very happy moment.  If we ever put our house up for sale, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be repainting rooms (some are definitely not house sale colors) and we&#39;ll take care to make them look as professional as we can.  But for now, this is our home and we can have it look however we want.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255816758,"authorName":"Mel","from":"&quot;Mel&quot; &lt;beensclan@...&gt;","profile":"beensclan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling experience today","postDate":"1254396376","msgId":47736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhMjNrbys2NGE2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhhMWFwZCs5ZmVjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47732,"nextInTopic":47740,"prevInTime":47735,"nextInTime":47737,"topicId":47732,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" and Katy had such fun and really worked hard and didn t goof off or make a mess.

So today we decided to paint her room together. This is not my favorite thing to do and I have painted walls maybe once in my life. We cleared space in her room and cleaned a little. I asked her to help me measure the room for the area (but I didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it or make it a lesson in math (yay for me!)figuring that the lesson was that she would see that it was something necessary to be done in the process of painting a room. Then we walked to the paint store down the street and chose our color and bought the supplies and came home. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe got two walls painted and Katy had such fun and really worked hard and didn&#39;t goof off or make a mess. I was so pleased with her. She remarked that it always looked so much easier on tv when kids painted and we talked about how tv shows only show the fun parts. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother would never have allowed me to help her paint since she wouldn&#39;t expect I would do a good job.
