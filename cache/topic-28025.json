Julia and Jonah each had tutoring in school until they were dependent.  I participated and know the skills they used to get them there.  Reading with Julia can be books of her choice. We can read together (which she loves) or independently.  Her older sibs can also read to her and with her. I usually dont let Jonah on runescape until his reading is done, but remember we are newly homeschooling and I need to get organized here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra I am so grateful for all of your work and all the info available to me here on the net.  It makes our transformation so much easier.  I feel so much support.  I used the proposed curfriculum on your unschooling site for each of my kids, I just edited it to their needs.
