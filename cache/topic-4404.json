I have to work with where<br/>\nwe are now, and getting comfortable with giving the<br/>\nkids more freedoms than we have given them (which was<br/>\nalready too much for my family to be comfortable not<br/>\ntelling me about.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I&#39;d be interested in Nancy&#39;s input into why she<br/>\n&gt;thinks her kids are choosing so many sweets in<br/>\n&gt;comparison to yours.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Just FYI, it&#39;s Nanci, not Nancy.  Perhaps there is<br/>\nsomething to the notion that refined sugars are more<br/>\naddictive and affecting to some people or some<br/>\nethnicities than others.  I don&#39;t think psychology is<br/>\nALL of it.  I have seen too many dramatic effects of<br/>\nthe chemistry of food in different people.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if that IS the case, it is even more important let<br/>\nmy sons learn how to self regulate their diets for<br/>\ntheir own health.  We decided it was important to<br/>\nloosen up the strictures we had adopted for safety&#39;s<br/>\nsake, now that Thomas is old enough to know and<br/>\nrecognize most of his allergens.  I still keep a close<br/>\neye on what he eats and have to veto certain things,<br/>\nbut try to let him make his own choices when the<br/>\nallergen or sensativity is not a dangerous one.  If he<br/>\nmay get somewhat ill or have more minor reactions<br/>\n(like upset stomache, headache, fatigue, emotional<br/>\nuncontrollability, rashes, etc) due to intolerances, I<br/>\nlet him go ahead and eat it if he really wants to and<br/>\nthen help him through the aftermath, and talk about<br/>\nwhy that is happening and why I recommended against<br/>\nhis eating that thing in the first place.  He<br/>\ngenerally trusts me and also will often take one bite<br/>\nand then not eat any more of something that doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&quot;taste right&quot; to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps they are going wile right now because we<br/>\nhave been strict in the past.  We had to keep a lot of<br/>\nfood away from him when he was little, while we were<br/>\nstill discovering his allergies and having emergency<br/>\ntrips to the hospital.  His little brother,<br/>\nunfortunatly, got the fallout of all the food<br/>\nstricture, even though he has very few and mild<br/>\nsensativities.  Alex (my younger) is also much more<br/>\nrelaxed about what he eats, and doesn&#39;t eat all the<br/>\nsweets his brother does.  Today they ate pretzels all<br/>\nmorning and then Alex had some eggs and Thomas had a<br/>\njelly sandwich (lots of carbos).  Last night at<br/>\ndinner, we have stuffed, roasted turkey, candied yams<br/>\nand homemade biscuits.  I had a big turkey to cook<br/>\nthat we got free, so I did the whole turkey thing. <br/>\nThomas ate a lot of turkey and a biscuit for dinner. <br/>\nThings seem to be improving a  bit but I anticipate<br/>\nthis will be a bit like the deschooling struggle is<br/>\nfor others.  Is this Demenuing?<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
