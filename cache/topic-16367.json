I posted about Adriane and her gymnastics meets.  She<br/>\ntends to freak herself out over them and somehow injure herself.  She has<br/>\nbrought on asthma prior to meets, missed landings on apparatus right before,<br/>\netc..  Never fails its something.  I have pointed out this pattern,<br/>\nsuggested perhaps the stress is a problem, asked if she wanted to quit the<br/>\nteam and just take classes, etc.  She is adamant that she wants to be on the<br/>\nteam.   OK.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is at a meet with her Dad right now.  I picked her up from class on<br/>\nThursday and she was grumpy.  I asked what was wrong and she began to cry.<br/>\nAdriane is 12 by the way.  She had injured her foot and it was quite painful<br/>\nand she was sure that she wouldn&#39;t do well in the meet.  She said &quot;everyone<br/>\nsays your&#39;e doing great but I know I&#39;m not.&quot;  And she cried and I hugged<br/>\nher.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter awhile I suggested that perhaps, in her mind, she should just ignore<br/>\nthe meets, ignore the competition, just do gymnastics because she loves it<br/>\nand for no other reason than that.  It seemed to help and she was happy when<br/>\nshe went to bed that night.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16366,"nextTopicId":16362}}
