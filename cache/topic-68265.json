She  <br/>\nwriting about seeing choices.  I don&#39;t want to give away the joy and  <br/>\nthe details, but it&#39;s very nicely written and was wonderfully done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unprocessedfamily.blogspot.com/2012/07/turning-day-around.html\">http://unprocessedfamily.blogspot.com/2012/07/turning-day-around.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to reveal part (not all) of the ending, just in case someone  <br/>\nis wondering whether it&#39;s worth reading.  Looking back on the day  <br/>\nshe&#39;s described, she wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If I&#39;d stayed on my path that I started on, my kids would have felt  <br/>\nlike a bother, a pain, a grudging responsibility. One of them for sure  <br/>\nwould have felt unloved. Another would have closed me out. The other  <br/>\ntwo would have just gotten crankier and crankier as the emotional  <br/>\nundercurrent they didn&#39;t understand got yuckier. Instead, every one of  <br/>\nmy kids went to sleep feeling loved and like they&#39;d lived the day all  <br/>\nthe way through.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad Sarah has written and shared that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68258,"nextTopicId":68254}}
