It is <br/>\nillegal to change your underwear in a public restroom. It USED to be illegal <br/>\nto carry a chicken in under your arm when crossing in front of the Dillon <br/>\nCounty courthouse, but that one&#39;s off the books now. We, of course, cannot <br/>\nbuy alcohol on Sunday and all public bars must close at midnight Saturday <br/>\n(unless they buy an expensive waiver to renewed weekly/monthly). Depending on <br/>\nyour county, some stores are closed on Sunday, some cannot open until 12 or <br/>\n1, and some are open according to the management&#39;s wishes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\nblue laws<br/>\nblue laws,<br/>\nlegislation regulating public and private conduct, especially laws relating <br/>\nto Sabbath observance. The term was originally applied to the 17th-century <br/>\nlaws of the theocratic New Haven colony; they were called &quot;blue laws after <br/>\nthe blue paper on which they were printed. New Haven and other Puritan <br/>\ncolonies of New England had rigid laws prohibiting Sabbath breaking, breaches <br/>\nin family discipline, drunkenness, and excesses in dress. Although such <br/>\nlegislation had its origins in European &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/40700.html&quot;\">http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/40700.html&quot;</a>&gt;Sabbatarian&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/45055.html&quot;\">http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/45055.html&quot;</a>&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/A&gt;, the <br/>\nterm &quot;blue laws is usually applied only to American legislation. With the <br/>\ndissolution of the Puritan theocracies after the American Revolution, blue <br/>\nlaws declined; many of them lay forgotten in state statute books only to be <br/>\nrevived much later. The growth of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/10544.html&quot;\">http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/10544.html&quot;</a>&gt;prohibition&lt;/A&gt; movement in the 19th cent. <br/>\nand early 20th cent. brought with it other laws regulating private conduct. <br/>\nMany states forbade the sale of cigarettes, and laws prohibited secular <br/>\namusements as well as all unnecessary work on Sunday; provision was made for <br/>\nstrict local censorship of books, plays, films and other means of instruction <br/>\nand entertainment. Although much of this legislation has been softened if not <br/>\nrepealed, there are still many areas and communities in the United States, <br/>\nespecially those where religious fundamentalism is strong, that retain blue <br/>\nlaws. The Supreme Court has upheld Sunday closing laws ruling that such laws <br/>\ndo not interfere with the free exercise of religion and do not constitute the <br/>\nestablishment of a state religion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.envy.nu/elmorocks/laws.html&quot;\">http://www.envy.nu/elmorocks/laws.html&quot;</a>&gt;Click here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.envy.nu/elmorocks/laws.html&lt;/A\">http://www.envy.nu/elmorocks/laws.html&lt;/A</a>&gt;  <br/>\n<br/>\n funny blue laws across the country<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2833,"nextTopicId":2741}}
