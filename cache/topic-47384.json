Some of that was intentional to keep younger people out  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of the work force longer.

You really believe they  <br/>\n&gt; are physically and mentally ready for that? I know 20 year olds who  <br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t ready for it. Yes, in times past teens got married and had  <br/>\n&gt; children and in other cultures still do, however, that was done  <br/>\n&gt; because the life expectancy rate was/is not that long. You were a  <br/>\n&gt; geezer in your 40&#39;s so it made sense to begin breeding at 12, 13, 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But this isn&#39;t the situation at all. This 13 year old having a  <br/>\nrelationship with an adult in their twenties is hypothetical. The 17  <br/>\nyear old and an adult in her late 20&#39;s (how old that is, I&#39;m not sure)  <br/>\nis the situation. The mom knows her son pretty well. She&#39;s asking for  <br/>\nhelp in her thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nPainting all teens with the broad brush of &quot;they don&#39;t have enough  <br/>\nexperience&quot; vs all adults with &quot;they have enough experience&quot; is too  <br/>\nmuch generalization, for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 14 year old daughter is barely ready for a relationship with a  <br/>\nsimilarly-aged kid, let alone an older person. *I* know that about  <br/>\nher. *She* talks to me about it. And she&#39;s having too much fun playing  <br/>\nPokemon and World of Warcraft to be really want any kind of  <br/>\nrelationship other than friends with the same interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure the mom knows whether her son is even close to being  <br/>\nready for a relationship. Maybe she&#39;s figuring out how to overcome her  <br/>\ndeep biases about age. Age isn&#39;t always the predictor of maturity, nor  <br/>\nis experience.  Some adults make the same immature mistakes over and  <br/>\nover again - experience didn&#39;t help them at all.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you suggesting that if a parent tells their teenage son not to  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; date an older woman and why, that he will learn his lessons on  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dating and life?  That&#39;s a pretty typical way in which parents try  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; to raise teens, tell them what to do and find ways to make them do  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; what you tell them so that they will learn the proper ways in  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; which to conduct their own lives when they turn the magic age of  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 18.  It flies in the face of reality!  Teens do what they want to  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; do and find ways to get around their parent&#39;s rules by lying and  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; being sneaky.  The desire to be independent is very intense in  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; teen years, and I really believe that it&#39;s that way for a  <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; reason!   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; no, i&#39;m suggesting that when the teenage son lives a few years on  <br/>\n&gt; his own, supporting himself and finding out who he really is, then  <br/>\n&gt; he will learn life lessons on dating and so forth. The parent cannot  <br/>\n&gt; do this. My whole argument is this: time. time is the essential  <br/>\n&gt; teacher.  Only when you realize you don&#39;t know anything, then you  <br/>\n&gt; are starting to learn.  To let a person who has virtual no  <br/>\n&gt; independant life experience take upon a relationship that will be  <br/>\n&gt; far beyond his years and has potential life-changing consequences  <br/>\n&gt; (i.e. a child produced from the union) with your blessing, is  <br/>\n&gt; irresponsible.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So a teenager should move out to learn all this stuff on his own,  <br/>\n*then* he can make these decisions, and that&#39;s the only way? I think  <br/>\nmost unschooling parents of teens would heartily disagree. They have  <br/>\nenormous influence on their kids&#39; lives, though they don&#39;t make  <br/>\ndecisions for them.  Unschooled kids appreciate their parents being  <br/>\npart of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be suggesting that one should just say &quot;have at it&quot; to  <br/>\ntheir kid with no advice, no talking about it, no help. Unschoolers  <br/>\ndon&#39;t do that. How long have you unschooled your kids? How would you  <br/>\ntalk with them and help them?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship you wrote about as a warning - was that between a  <br/>\npeacefully-parented teen and an adult? Was that child raised in  <br/>\nmainstream ways? It would be good to know, because it&#39;s like comparing  <br/>\napples and oranges - they&#39;re both fruit, but grown on different trees.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Robin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130027733,"authorName":"bmantovani","from":"&quot;bmantovani&quot; &lt;bmantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: couples of dissimilar ages","postDate":"1253409648","msgId":47404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg5NDAxZys3a2ZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2MjA4MS44NjEwNi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47403,"nextInTopic":47405,"prevInTime":47403,"nextInTime":47405,"topicId":47384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It would have been legal  <br/>\nfor them to have sex.  My first concern was whether, if Holly did  <br/>\ndecide to move into the relationship, she would be endangering this  <br/>\nguy.  Would she have the opportunity (without knowing, without being  <br/>\naware of the lifelong consequences) to set him up to be seen as a sex  <br/>\noffender if ANYone complained?  In some cases it wouldn&#39;t help at all  <br/>\nif the girl and the parents all said &quot;No, it&#39;s okay.&quot;  There ARE  <br/>\ndifferent laws different places, and if a law is violated that way and  <br/>\nit&#39;s reported by someone else, it&#39;s not up to &quot;the victim&quot; to press  <br/>\ncharges or not.   So the legal danger in that situation was much more  <br/>\nto the older male than to Holly.    And we checked before they had so  <br/>\nmuch as held hands, before we knew if it had any go-ahead in it or  <br/>\nnot, because I didn&#39;t want to encourage or condone something that  <br/>\nwould be a legal danger to either of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to a friend who&#39;s an assistant DA to get a clarification on  <br/>\nthe law in New Mexico, which was worded in an ambiguous way.  He said  <br/>\nit was ambiguous intentionally, but he knew that the instructions to  <br/>\njurors defined it the more liberal (younger) way, as the beginning of  <br/>\n16, not the end of 16.  And in some states there&#39;s a relative age  <br/>\nrange that moves along with them, something about the difference in  <br/>\nage.  Not everywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd probably in all states, any parent who said &quot;yeah sure&quot; about a 14  <br/>\nyear old with anyone much older than that would be being VERY  <br/>\nirresponsible, legally and morally.

Meeting the person to discuss the situation in an &quot;open and honest way&quot; only suggests to the child that the situation is okay with you and that you are giving your approval.  I MIGHT meet separately with the woman to try to discover her motives and let her know that I absolutely did not approve, but to that extent, only.  Side note: when I was 16 I went on a couple of dates with a man who was 22 years old. My mother believed that it would be better to &quot;actually meet the person and discuss this stuff in person&quot;; she did and it only confirmed in my mind that she was giving her blessing to the relationship, when, in reality, she was feeling the opposite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Teenagers are not children.  They are closer to being adults than children.  They are fully reproductive mammals.  Our culture keeps teens from growing up by keeping them locked away, in a holding pattern.  Some of that was intentional to keep younger people out of the work force longer.  It really wasn&#39;t that long ago that teens got married and had children and there are still cultures around the world that do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>sorry, but they are, indeed, children.  many girls aged 13 and 14 (teenagers) have not even begun menstruating. Seriously?!?!?! It would be okay with you if a 13 year old teenager was having a sexual relationship with an adult in their 20&#39;s?  You really believe they are physically and mentally ready for that? I know 20 year olds who aren&#39;t ready for it. Yes, in times past teens got married and had children and in other cultures still do, however, that was done because the life expectancy rate was/is not that long. You were a geezer in your 40&#39;s so it made sense to begin breeding at 12, 13, 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Are you suggesting that if a parent tells their teenage son not to date an older woman and why, that he will learn his lessons on dating and life?  That&#39;s a pretty typical way in which parents try to raise teens, tell them what to do and find ways to make them do what you tell them so that they will learn the proper ways in which to conduct their own lives when they turn the magic age of 18.  It flies in the face of reality!  Teens do what they want to do and find ways to get around their parent&#39;s rules by lying and being sneaky.  The desire to be independent is very intense in teen years, and I really believe that it&#39;s that way for a reason!   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>no, i&#39;m suggesting that when the teenage son lives a few years on his own, supporting himself and finding out who he really is, then he will learn life lessons on dating and so forth. The parent cannot do this. My whole argument is this: time. time is the essential teacher.  Only when you realize you don&#39;t know anything, then you are starting to learn.  To let a person who has virtual no independant life experience take upon a relationship that will be far beyond his years and has potential life-changing consequences (i.e. a child produced from the union) with your blessing, is irresponsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t   <br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLauren found her dream laptop.

Albeit, he was an extremely mature and bright seventeen year old, but he was still 17 years old.  When she became pregnant, he stood up and met his responsibilities.

Seems she was just a control freak who was looking for a sperm donor and he has now lived a nightmare the last seven years,  fighting to be a part of his daughter&#39;s life. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The moral of that story, is don&#39;t have unprotected sex, discuss birth control with your partner and all the what if scenarios of an accidental pregnancy.  The very same thing could&#39;ve happened to that 17 yr old with another 17 yr old.  Some women would do that even with someone closer to their own age, be controlling and look for a sperm donor.  While it may seem strange for an older woman to be interested in a much younger man, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that she is looking for someone to make babies with.  Just for the record, my dad was 17, time wise, he would&#39;ve been newly 17, not close to 18, when he got married to my mother who is 6 yrs older than he is, they had me a year later and they are still married. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m not saying that the same situation couldn&#39;t happen with a woman his own age, but, generally speaking I find it odd that a grown woman would be romantically interested in, essentially, a child.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Teenagers are not children.  They are closer to being adults than children.  They are fully reproductive mammals.  Our culture keeps teens from growing up by keeping them locked away, in a holding pattern.  Some of that was intentional to keep younger people out of the work force longer.  It really wasn&#39;t that long ago that teens got married and had children and there are still cultures around the world that do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I also don&#39;t believe that a teenager has the emotional maturity or foresight to detect when someone is using them or has ulterior motives.  And personally, I don&#39;t believe &quot;schooling&quot; or &quot;unschooling&quot; has anything to do with this situation; it is about wisdom gained through lessons learned that do not present themselves early in life.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Are you suggesting that if a parent tells their teenage son not to date an older woman and why, that he will learn his lessons on dating and life?  That&#39;s a pretty typical way in which parents try to raise teens, tell them what to do and find ways to make them do what you tell them so that they will learn the proper ways in which to conduct their own lives when they turn the magic age of 18.  It flies in the face of reality!  Teens do what they want to do and find ways to get around their parent&#39;s rules by lying and being sneaky.  The desire to be independent is very intense in teen years, and I really believe that it&#39;s that way for a reason!   <br/>\n<br/>\nThat hasn&#39;t happened at my house at all.  I don&#39;t tell my daughter what to do or how to conduct her life.  We talk about what she could do or should do and why, but ultimately the decision is hers.  She&#39;s learning everyday about how to behave in this world, she&#39;s gaining wisdom through living her life, and she&#39;s young still.  The wisdom and lessons are presenting themselves right now, early in life!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] couples of dissimilar ages","postDate":"1253404753","msgId":47389,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUwN0UxNEVDLTVDRDItNDVDNi1CMzkwLTRCMzQyNTkyN0I1N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFNOVDEwMS1XMzc4QTY1MDc2RjYzOUJDRTQ1N0E1OUVEREYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PDIxODNCNUEwLURFMDEtNEY5Mi1CQTlDLTE2MjEyQjc4NjU4QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPFNOVDEwMS1XMzc4QTY1MDc2RjYzOUJDRTQ1N0E1OUVEREYwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":47388,"nextInTopic":47390,"prevInTime":47388,"nextInTime":47390,"topicId":47384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=  And personally, I don t believe schooling or unschooling has anything to do with this situation; it is about wisdom gained through lessons learned that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2026401816\">-=  And personally, I don&#39;t believe &quot;schooling&quot; or &quot;unschooling&quot; has  <br/>\nanything to do with this situation; it is about wisdom gained through  <br/>\nlessons learned that do not present themselves early in life.=-<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything on this list has to do with unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the current &quot;wisdom&quot; has to do with high school, which is why  <br/>\nI was asking for particular ideas and real experiences.

Maybe she&#39;s great.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I would do.  I think that many parents are wary of their kids meeting people in real life that they&#39;ve met online.  Chamille has met several of her friends online first.  Her boyfriend is one of them, who she met through his best friend, which she&#39;d talked with online for about a year before ever meeting him in person.  Right now, at this very moment she is hanging out with 5 other kids, 3 of whom she initially met online.  They all know each other now.<br/>\nShe had met an older guy online and then in person.  I met him when she met him along with one of her friends.  He was a nice guy and they did a lot of group activities like the movies or out to eat or hanging out at the mall.  She was 14 and he was 20.  She wasn&#39;t interested in dating him and made that clear.  I had to let go of my own discomfort on that one.  Afterall, Chamille is no school girl!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Unschooled kids are more mature in many caes than others around them....   <br/>\n </span></blockquote> ....But her interpersonal <br/>\nabilities are beyond most school kids&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nThis is very true for Chamille too.  Not that she&#39;s mature about everything or in every circumstance, but in general her interpersonal skills are beyond most school kids.  Her relationship with her boyfriend fascinates me on many levels.  They deal with things in a more mature fashion than a lot of adults I know.  He&#39;s a year and a half younger than she is.  His parents don&#39;t like that at all, they view him as a little kid, and he so isn&#39;t.  They were very concerned with the age difference, even though, if she were in school, they&#39;d only be a grade apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;School has given us a false picture and a false situation about <br/>\n </span></blockquote>marriage ages.  It makes no sense. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nNot just marriages, any relationship!  It seems strange to me how parents treat teens in this regard, as if they aren&#39;t capable of having real relationships with a significant other.  I do see many teens that can&#39;t, who treat all relationships in superficial ways, they play games with each other.  Chamille was friends with a kid for a while, she really liked him in lots of ways, but found out that he was a gossip and played weird head games.  She won&#39;t have anything to do with him anymore, she gave him 2 chances to stop what he was doing, then dumped him.  He wasn&#39;t a boyfriend, he&#39;s gay and liked her boyfriend, which didn&#39;t go over well.<br/>\nIt makes more sense to me to be discriminating about who to hang out with or not, based on other things than age.     <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":232129128,"authorName":"Cynthia Hartley","from":"Cynthia Hartley &lt;hartley_31@...&gt;","profile":"jjgalt2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] couples of dissimilar ages","postDate":"1253396321","msgId":47388,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFNOVDEwMS1XMzc4QTY1MDc2RjYzOUJDRTQ1N0E1OUVEREYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxODNCNUEwLURFMDEtNEY5Mi1CQTlDLTE2MjEyQjc4NjU4QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDIxODNCNUEwLURFMDEtNEY5Mi1CQTlDLTE2MjEyQjc4NjU4QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":47387,"nextInTopic":47389,"prevInTime":47387,"nextInTime":47389,"topicId":47384,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If I were the mother of that boy, I would not let him date a woman in her late 20 s.
