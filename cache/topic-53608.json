In the meantime, he can always ask me if he&#39;s not sure about a word and if it&#39;s not perfect, who cares -- his &quot;readers&quot; (dad, me, grandparents) can figure it out. If he chooses to fix it, he can (and I&#39;m always happy to help out). I&#39;ve also told him I&#39;m happy to write down anything he&#39;d like me to as scribing is an excellent way to ease the internal pressure. Writing is also frustrating for kids because there&#39;s no way their fine motor skills can get down their ideas as fast as they can think them... another good reason to scribe for as long as they want it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Rebecca</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Writing question","postDate":"1272591148","msgId":53625,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1NTIzLjc2Mzc1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA1Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhyY2Y3aStpYXBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhyY2Y3aStpYXBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53618,"nextInTopic":53629,"prevInTime":53624,"nextInTime":53626,"topicId":53608,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1240329061\">&lt;&lt;&lt;My 6-year-old can write the letters of the alphabet, 3-letter-words, and<br/>\n&quot;I love you&quot;.
