If someone can<br/>\ncreate, maintain and experience peace in normal circumstances, THAT is<br/>\nreally<br/>\nuseful.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been looking up quotes on breathing and meditation a lot lately,<br/>\nin preparation for the conference. One of the sentiments I came<br/>\nacross, that I really love is to never see the daily tasks-wiping<br/>\nnoses, comforting bruises, preparing food, cleaning up-as something to<br/>\nget through in order to do the important stuff. It IS the important<br/>\nstuff. It IS the practice.<br/>\nHow well we navigate these &quot;mundane&quot; tasks, is really the crux of LIFE. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a picture of a Swami, the caption underneath says something<br/>\nlike;&quot;You can&#39;t avoid the waves in life, but you can learn to surf&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace isn&#39;t the absence of conflict, it is remaining a calm pool<br/>\namidst the storm.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23076,"nextTopicId":23079}}
