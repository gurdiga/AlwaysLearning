AND I know I am ignorant of many things that were supposedly taught to me in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college organic chemistry, first term I got a B.  This was really scary, because I did not get it at all.  It was graded on a curve.  Second term, I got a D, because I was already lost going into it from first term.  The D still earned me &quot;credit&quot; for the course, which enabled me to move on to organic chemistry where I was clueless from the get go.  Managed to eke through with another B and D though.  That all seems really dumb to me!  Even with those two D&#39;s my final grade point was 3.7 or something like that.
