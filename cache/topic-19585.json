This <br/>\nWednesday, May 19th, Homeschool.com will be interviewing Christopher Paolini, <br/>\nauthor of Eragon.  Although he is only in his early twenties, his book is #1 <br/>\non the New York Times bestseller list, he has made guest appearances on both <br/>\nthe David Letterman and Jay Leno shows, and he has sold the movie rights to his <br/>\nbook. Christopher attributes his success to the fact that he was <br/>\nhomeschooled. You can read more about Christopher in Homeschool.com&#39;s April newsletter at <br/>\nHomeschool.com.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChristopher is an inspiration to homeschooled teens everywhere and we invite <br/>\nboth you and your older children to listen in as we interview Christopher and <br/>\nfind out: <br/>\n<br/>\n  a.. What type of homeschooling did Christopher do? Unschooling? <br/>\nSchool-at-Home? <br/>\n<br/>\n  b.. Did he follow a particular curriculum? <br/>\n<br/>\n  c.. Is his household TV-free? <br/>\n<br/>\n  d.. How did his parents encourage him? What can we learn from that? <br/>\n<br/>\n  e.. What advice does he have for other aspiring writers? <br/>\n<br/>\n  f.. Can he give us a sneak preview on what will happen in Part Two? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWant to listen in on the interview? Maybe even ask your own question? <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how it works:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) This Wednesday, May 19th<br/>\n<br/>\n    12:00 (Pacific time)<br/>\n<br/>\n      1:00 (Mountain Time)<br/>\n<br/>\n      2:00 (Central Time)<br/>\n<br/>\n      3:00 (Eastern Time)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Dial (507) 726-3270 and then enter the passcode: 55095#<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You will automatically be patched into a giant conference call (Lots of <br/>\nenergy and very exciting).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you happen to miss the live interview, you can still listen to the <br/>\nrecorded interview at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.homeschool.com/articles/Camp2004\">http://www.homeschool.com/articles/Camp2004</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
