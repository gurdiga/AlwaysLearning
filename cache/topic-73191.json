I apologize for sounding argumentative. It wasn&#39;t my intention but I see that was the result. I do appreciate that folks are willing to take the time to offer their thoughts and ideas. I was stuck and looking for someone to give me &quot;the&quot; answer to that issue. And I realized it&#39;s about fear. I struggled with sleep problems for a very long time (undiagnosed medical issues, night-owl tendencies and day person life as a child, other things). Also my son has reached an age where I was already working and trying to leave home (ran away a few times), life was very tumultuous for me then with worry about things as basic as food, shelter and personal safety. I worry I have not given him tools to care for himself when I watch some things he does. More fear and crazy\n overblown connections.</span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span><br></span></div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span>I think knowing we are moving near my husband&#39;s family when we&#39;ve been pretty out of sight for many years has brought insecurities and doubts to the surface I hadn&#39;t really realized were still lurking. We&#39;ve had years to adjust our ideas, principles and expectations. We&#39;ve never really talked much with his family about our choices. <br><br>As to the practical part of the question I asked, I think for the time being he&#39;s let go of trying to be up early to game with the one friend. I did make a list of all the ideas people\n offered, even ones that were the same or very close to things we&#39;ve talked about or tried. I left it on the table while I was doing some other things, and he saw it. We talked about some of the ideas and about other things. He asked me to hang onto the list, so I tucked it in my calendar book where either of us can find it again and use it or add to it. <br><br>Thanks again. I&#39;m going to go read some more then go join my son so he can catch me up on things he was working on last night. He came down while I was working on this and said once he finishes a skype call with a friend back east he wants to show me some stuff. I&#39;m grateful he wants to share what he&#39;s been up to with me. <br><br>LisaR<br></span></div><div style=\"display:block;\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-937944567ygrps-yiv-379495820yahoo_quoted\"> <br><div

Wouldn&#39;t adding in other stuff now send a message we think he should be doing something different if he didn&#39;t ask for it? Coincidentally, in a conversation totally unrelated to Parkour over the weekend, he asked about getting a hula hoop so I&#39;m going to find one when I&#39;m out shopping tomorrow.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>A few months ago I did tell him we&#39;d be happy to take him twice a week if he wanted to do that.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>Also I don&#39;t know if it makes a difference with the opinion to stop invitinging or not but the invites to go walking or to the gym have been offered since long before any of us even knew what Parkour was. Since he became able to stay home if he didn&#39;t want to go some where with us, we usually invite him to join us whether it&#39;s going out of the house to go to the store, to a movie, to a museum, to visit someone, go on walk or bike ride or whatever. So since he often will say no to those other activities, would the recommendation be to stop offering those as well? Wouldn&#39;t continuing to invite for those &quot;non exercise&quot; things but discontinuing walking or gym visit invites potentially send a negative/confusing message? He doesn&#39;t seem upset in any way when we offer, usually he says something along the lines of &quot;thanks, I&#39;m good here&quot; or something like that. I realized the &quot;always says no&quot; to walks/gym was a misstatement by me as I remembered, while talking with my husband, there have been times my son went on walks with me when I went in the evenings- up until this past summer when he stopped because the weather got too hot for comfort and he just hasn&#39;t taken me up on any since then.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>He chose not to go to Parkour today. When he told me I simply said okay and that I would let them know at the facility his class is held at.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>Someone asked about finding other groups, more locally and such. I sometimes check online, by calling around to other gyms/fitness centers, and asking other people I know are interested. I&#39;ve checked a couple of the local colleges and libraries for bulletin boards where things get posted. If you have other ideas on places to check, I&#39;m all ears. So far none have shown up other than college kids &quot;that are focused more on doing tricks than on doing Parkour&quot; according to my son. My son doesn&#39;t do backflips, but were he able to and wanting to practice, I certainly would set up a space for him to do that. My idea was that if a group of home educated kids were interested, we could have set up a class during the day, during the week if it helped with gaming times and sleeping patterns for him. Plus I thought he might enjoy having a class with kids he knows better- he thought it was a cool idea when I asked him if any of his friends had expressed interest in going a few months ago.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>Maybe this in an internal struggle about what he wants to do as was suggested. I think we were clear with him when he started that we&#39;re happy to take him as long as he wants to go and that we&#39;ll support him as well if he decides he wants to stop. So I hope he&#39;d tell us if he didn&#39;t want to go anymore.<br><br>Either way things will all be changing in a few months when we move.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br><br>I&#39;m still reading and contemplating but those are some thoughts I had.<span class=\"ygrps-yiv-137647324Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><br></p></div></span></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Teen with conflicting motivations/desires","postDate":"1390001454","msgId":73343,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxiY2VmZSsxMjhsZmZvQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PERFOTUyOTg5LTk3NzEtNDZGNC1CRjhDLUFFRkZFMzVCM0RBNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzODkxNTgzNDkuNTQ1MDMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2NDUwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxGMkNEMzY4MC1GQTNELTQ3NjctOTFCOC0wQTgzMzYwMTdBN0JAYmlncG9uZC5jb20+IDwxMzg5MjI2NTczLjQxODE0LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxNjQ1MDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0U3Qzc4NzUtOTkxQy00MDMzLUE5NkQtNTM5RjFDQzFENDgyQGJpZ3BvbmQuY29tPiA8MDk3RUU1RTYtOTdBNC00REJGLTgzNjUtNTRFOTY4ODQ1RjdEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bGI1NGthK2Fhc241bkBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxERTk1Mjk4OS05NzcxLTQ2RjQtQkY4Qy1BRUZGRTM1QjNEQTVAdmVyaXpvbi5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":73328,"nextInTopic":73348,"prevInTime":73342,"nextInTime":73344,"topicId":73191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It helps me to step back and think about how *I* learn new things, particularly new skills. I like learning new skills, so it&#39;s a familiar process. If it&#39;s something challenging, then after the first rush of &quot;hey, I think I can do this&quot; I get to what I call The Frustration Plateau (in my mind, it has capital letters, just like that, but it&#39;s in a bold, scary font). When I get to the Frustration Plateau I feel like I&#39;m all thumbs, like I can&#39;t possibly hold enough new information in my mind and my muscles to be able to succeed.Because learning new things is something I&#39;ve done many times, it doesn&#39;t take me too long to notice I&#39;m there - and when I notice, I relax a bit. I won&#39;t get through the Frustration Plateau by grinding my teeth and fretting harder, I&#39;ll get through it with repetition and practice. I try to make choices with that in mind. But it absolutely won&#39;t help for someone else to say &quot;oh, you just need to practice&quot; - that will only get me more frustrated ;)<br><br>With that in mind, it&#39;s easier for me to see when Mo gets to &quot;frustration plateaus&quot; of her own. Sometimes she decides whatever she&#39;s working on isn&#39;t worth it at that point. Sometimes she storms away in tears. Sometimes she flutters around in a state of indecision, unable to do exactly what she wants the way she wants yet, but not interested in anything else. I&#39;ve learned to commiserate and not offer too many ideas and options - just one or two to see if that&#39;s what she needs, and then I drop it. During calm, social moments, I tell her about my own frustrations and how I get through them. Sometimes she commiserates with me and tells me her strategies to get through when she&#39;s stuck. &nbsp;</span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: Teen with conflicting motivations/desires","postDate":"1389793692","msgId":73328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERFOTUyOTg5LTk3NzEtNDZGNC1CRjhDLUFFRkZFMzVCM0RBNUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxiNTRrYSthYXNuNW5AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzODkxNTgzNDkuNTQ1MDMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2NDUwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDxGMkNEMzY4MC1GQTNELTQ3NjctOTFCOC0wQTgzMzYwMTdBN0JAYmlncG9uZC5jb20+IDwxMzg5MjI2NTczLjQxODE0LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxNjQ1MDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8Q0U3Qzc4NzUtOTkxQy00MDMzLUE5NkQtNTM5RjFDQzFENDgyQGJpZ3BvbmQuY29tPiA8MDk3RUU1RTYtOTdBNC00REJGLTgzNjUtNTRFOTY4ODQ1RjdEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bGI1NGthK2Fhc241bkBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73327,"nextInTopic":73343,"prevInTime":73327,"nextInTime":73329,"topicId":73191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

What you&#39;re *really* asking is how you can fix him so he can do what he says he wants to. (People reveal a whole lot more than they realize by how they write about something.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to unschool, the answer is to empower his choices. Create an environment where he has options that he can -- as much as possible -- do without relying on someone else AND the freedom from feeling pushed in a particular direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he needs more than a deluge of ideas to do things the &quot;right&quot; way is an understanding and sympathetic ear to his struggles as he tries to figure out what he really wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nLend him your power and your greater experience with the world. Let him tap into it. Offer ideas but don&#39;t attach yourself to him making the choice you believe is right  for what he says he wants to do. Open doors for him but don&#39;t stand next to the ones you think he should choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A few months ago I did tell him we&#39;d be happy to take<br/>\n&gt; him twice a week if he wanted to do that. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Describing why an idea won&#39;t work *feels* clarifying (to the teller). But to the people offering ideas it&#39;s discouraging and often shuts down the flow of ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s true in life, not just here.

They&#39;re principles that help unschooling flourish and ideas about what those principles might look like when put into action. This forum isn&#39;t for offering plug and play ideas. It&#39;s to help people understand the principles so they can figure out how to make those principles work in their own families.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; So since he often will say no to those other activities, would the recommendation be to stop offering those as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re looking for rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your post *you* tied the offers to walk with increasing his stamina. If the walks are just something that&#39;s always been in his life then he&#39;s not going to feel pressured. Unless *you&#39;re* focused on ways for him to increase his stamina. Then he&#39;s going to feel the pressure whether you say it in words or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ideas that will move closer to unschooling will empower him to make his own choices. Even if you think those choices won&#39;t help or aren&#39;t the best.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Someone asked about finding other groups, more locally and such...<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do put in effort to provide him with information and the power to make his choices happen. But recognize that *he* will put the effort into making something happen when it&#39;s important to him. Important enough to do rather than just think about doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd

Perhaps you see the solution as something that will result in your son building up his stamina and continuing to make progress with parkour.  If your son was really keen on taking parkour further than he does now, he has options to do so, but he&#39;s not choosing them.  There&#39;s no magic solution for you to find.  He has options.  He&#39;s making choices.  Supporting those, will be relationship-building and healing.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t need to know, but if something is triggering history within the mom, it will help her to know that and look at it as clearly as she can.

His unwillingness to do the extra is probably not because he doesn&#39;t understand the link between those things- but because he&#39;s grappling with whether or not he&#39;s really willing to do it).

I have searched for years to find a physical activity that I truly enjoy and will do whether I&#39;m tired or it&#39;s hard work. I ran regularly for a few months, dieted, lost two stone, got bored, put most of it back on again. I enjoyed it at first because the challenge was fun. The challenge of being able to run for two minutes, then five, then fifteen etc. Once I&#39;d achieved that it became boring. I tried swimming. Boring. I tried tennis. Boring. I tried home exercise videos. &nbsp;Boring. Then I stopped looking. I did a Gangnam Style parody dance at a home ed camp in the summer and enjoyed it so much I wanted to do more dancing. Now I do tango once a week (sometimes twice if I&#39;m going to a milonga - a tango party) and salsa once a week too. I get tired but I love it. There is no way you would get me running to build my stamina for dancing however much I love dancing. I would, however, dance every evening if I could, which would build my stamina naturally as I wouldn&#39;t be doing it for that reason.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1018041092Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;\"><br></span></div><div><span class=\"ygrps-yiv-1018041092Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;\">My dad&#39;s a personal trainer and he&#39;s very hot on people not forcing themselves to do exercise they don&#39;t enjoy.

We have done all of these activities, none of them with a prerequisite for additional exercise.  Currently, my son (11 years), is in a rock climbing program.  He has taken it twice before...last year I believe.  He loves it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust today the woman who was belaying him (holding and keeping the rope attached to his harness taught so that he could climb higher) told me that she felt he is doing the best he&#39;s ever done.  He did have difficulties with some of the climbs last time, and he was a bit frustrated.  I listened, encouraged, asked if he wanted to continue.  He didn&#39;t at the time, but requested it again just recently.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he decides it is something that he has a deep passion for, I have no doubt he will find a way to excel at it.  I could ruin any hope of him finding that passion if I offered too much advice that wasn&#39;t invited.  It&#39;s a fine balance.

Start a gaming club, either virtually or in real life.   Play with him yourself during the day.  Watch gaming videos with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor parkour...Take him to his parkour classes.  Give him room to explore it the way he wants to.  If he wants to perform better, find ways to help him do that at home.  It seems (from what you&#39;ve shared) that he prefers home.  Get a chin up bar.  They&#39;re inexpensive.  Get a miniature trampoline.  You can find them second hand and put it anywhere he spends a lot of time.  Get a yoga ball.  Get a jump rope, a hula hoop.  Make a parkour course down the hall or through the living room.  See if you can pick up an exercise mat second hand so he can practice his drops and rolls.  Pick up an inexpensive set of hand weights or pulleys. <br/>\n<br/>\nGet creative with him!

We have read many articles about dental hygiene in the past, from which they have formulated their own believes. Because they seem to believe that the germs will (&quot;get bigger&quot;) is that they choose not to have their sweets. <br>\n\nI am not a scientist,  nor a dentist to know exactly what it is that happens,  and I don&#39;t want to change their thinking,  I am okay with how they feel about it because that is their own informed decision/thought. If they chose to have the sweet and not brush their teeth that night (which has happened) I am okay with that choice as well, because it is one that the have made. <br>\n\nAs far as the toothbrush having lots of germs, well... I agree, and that is why we keep our toothbrushes inside a disinfectant container. We have actually looked at our toothbrushes under the microscope for fun, and yes, there were times in which we did see some movement, but for the most part, they are pretty clean. However,  because not everyone has the device,  I can understand what you are saying. <br>\n\nPerhaps not the best advice for someone who wouldn&#39;t have their toothbrushes disinfected...<br>\nFor the most part the children choose if they brush their teeth or not.

The\nencouragement to consider choosing to add in some activity between classes from\nmy or his dad has been probably a handful of times total, when our son has come\nto us to express his unhappiness about his level of ability. We mentioned how\nwhen he gets a new game, it takes practice to learn all the moves and to be\nable to do multiple combinations of keys or buttons quickly and efficiently and\nthat it’s the same sort of thing with developing his ability with PK. His coach\noccasionally suggests activities that would help him become proficient in tasks\nhe struggles to complete during classes.<br>\n<br>\nWe invited him to join activities we are doing that he expressed interest in\njoining and asked us to let him know when we’re doing them. It’s his decision\nto join us or not as it has been since he was able to stay home alone. Just as\nit is when we go to the store, or to a movie, or on a hike, or to a museum or\nwhatever else we come up with to do that he’s free to join us or not. As I\nmentioned in another post, it’s not a constant thing either, it’s been sometimes\nwhen I or my husband are heading to bed and we let him know we plan to do\nwhatever is happening the next day. I’ve actually <span style=\"\">&nbsp;</span>asked him (today) if he wants me to stop\nletting him know when I’m going walking since I don’t want to appear to be\npressuring him to do things differently. He said he wants me to keep letting\nhim know when I’m going because when he figures out what to do about his\nsleeping patterns he wants to go with me. I’m pretty sure he understands this\nis much like any other event or activity that we mention to him that falls into\nthe optional category- if he wants to join us, he is welcome. If he wishes not\nto join us, he is welcome to do that as well. </div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\"><br style=\"\">\n<br style=\"\">\n</div>\n\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&gt; I have invited him to walk with me</div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&gt; His dad has invited him to go to the gym with him</div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&gt; We&#39;ve offered to help him find a workout buddy</div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&gt;&gt;&gt;These invitations coupled with all the\n </div></span></blockquote>encouragement, give an implication that the people around him think he should\nbe doing things differently. &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\"><br>\nIf he hadn’t asked us to let him know when we were doing those things, I could\nsee that being the case. “All the encouragement” sounds like a lot. In the year\nhe’s been going to PK classes, the encouragement to add in other activity has\ncome from his father or me a handful of times. We know the coaches talk about\nthat stuff, so we tried to just let him know we are available to help if he\nwants, and if we saw something we thought might interest him we passed it on. That’s\nwhy I brought it to the list, to hopefully find some new ideas on things we\ncould try and not keep going on a tack that isn’t seeming to help. Should is\nalso a word that is rare in our house and has been for a long time. We’ve had\nlots of conversations about “should” and the difference between being\ninvited/offered something and being “should-ed” into doing things. <span style=\"\">&nbsp;</span>I’m fairly confident at this point, he knows\ninvitations are just that. Free to be accepted or rejected as he feels works\nfor him. </div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&gt;&gt;&gt;...I like to garden.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>And I like to do it without using\n </div></span></blockquote>insecticides.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>I know that insecticides\nare an option that lots of gardeners use, and I know that they may result in\nbigger crops, but even so, I choose not to use them.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>If several of my friends &quot;all\nencouraged&quot; me to spray insecticide to get rid of the bugs, and then my\nclosest friend invited me to share her insecticide, another close friend\ninvited me to go to a garden centre where I could buy insecticide, and together\nthey offered to find someone who would spray with me, I would feel\nmisunderstood, unsupported, disrespected.<span style=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</span>They could say that my garden won&#39;t work if I don&#39;t spray, and that they\nare only wanting to help me grow a great garden and point to the fact that I&#39;ve\nsaid I like to garden.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>But my focus is\nnot on a great garden.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>My focus is the\njoy I gain from gardening the way I do. \n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">I like to watch the fruits and vegetables germinate and\ngrow, the interplay of bugs and the seasons and the weather and the birds and the\nvarieties of plants.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>I like to explore\nand experiment and learn.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>It may not\nlook like the best way to garden, but I wouldn&#39;t enjoy gardening as much if I\ntook on a &#39;maximum harvest&#39; approach.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>I\nlike my approach.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>And I&#39;m grateful for\nfamily and friends who rejoice in my way because it works for me, regardless of\nthe productivity of my garden.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>\n<br>\nThe difference in your scenario is that you didn’t tell your friends that you\nare unhappy, frustrated or looking for ideas to do your chosen activity better,\nfaster, with more strength/stamina. My son expressed a wish for our help, more\nthan once. I’m not concerned with him being great at PK, I’m concerned with his\nexpression that he’s not finding joy in it because of the limits that come from\nonly doing it once a week. He wants to continue doing PK and I want him to\ncontinue to enjoy it. I want to help him find ideas for things he can try to\nimprove his enjoyment of it. What if you expressed an interest in getting help\nfor a problem that the way you garden hadn’t addressed yet because you were\ninexperienced and people you asked for help offered ideas and a bit of\nencouragement here and there, but you still hadn’t hit on the solution that\nworked for you so they just stopped talking about it or trying to find new\nideas? Would you take their inability to find that solution without going to\nothers for new, fresh ideas as an implication that you aren’t a good enough\ngardener or would you appreciate that your friends wanted you to succeed in\ngardening so much that they were willing to seek out new ideas/resources that\nmight be helpful to you (or feel something else totally)? Would you want them\nto just stop trying to find a way to help and to tell you they believed you\nwere a capable gardener even though you are struggling with being the gardener\nyou expressed a desire to be? Would it help you trust them to help you when you\nasked for help? <br>\n<br style=\"\">\n<br style=\"\">\n</div>\n\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&gt;&gt;&gt;Debbie&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>\n<br>\n </div></span></blockquote>I appreciate your response and questions to think about. \n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">Lisa</div>\n\n<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1144213775MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Teen with conflicting motivations/desires","postDate":"1389221810","msgId":73209,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1Rjg4RjdGLThDRUYtNDUxQi05RkYxLUFCMTNGNjc5RTVCOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxhazVoMCtjbmJmajhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEzODkxNTgzNDkuNTQ1MDMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2NDUwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDwyREE3M0ZDMS01QTg1LTRBNkUtQjlDNi00MDA5NTc3NkQyMjhAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxsYWs1aDArY25iZmo4QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73207,"nextInTopic":73213,"prevInTime":73208,"nextInTime":73210,"topicId":73191,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I object to over tired.

This is just a shift. For many years, supporting my son in sleeping by his own rhythms of wakefulness and sleepiness has worked very well for us. We&#39;ve just hit a little snag with conflicting intentions my son has for himeself and I just want to find a way to support him better. :-) <br><br>My 15 year old son usually stays up until the wee hours of the morning. It&#39;s not a negative thing except that it seems to conflict with other intentions he states he has. I&#39;ve tried a number of different ways to help him, and I&#39;m stumped. I try to keep things flexible so he can sleep as he wants/needs to and I watch what&#39;s going on in games when I can if he invites me in or if I pop my head in and he wants my company, (I\n get woozy feeling if I watch some games too long) and I listen to him talk about whatever he&#39;s doing, bring snacks, take away dirty dishes, whatever seems helpful or is asked for. I go try to get to bed by 10/11pm because I find I&#39;ve shifted into feeling better when I sleep earlier. <br><br>A couple months ago, he met a new friend who is a morning person but seemed interested in being included in the game play. So my son said he would get up in the early morning hours to play with her. This lasted a very short time and happens very intermittently now because he will sleep right through his alarm. I&#39;ve offered to wake him, and have tried to do so, always gently, yet he will roll over and go back to sleep but then be upset I didn&#39;t get him awake. If I try to be more insistent about waking him, still gently, he also tends to be frustrated and grumpy, I&#39;m guessing because he is short on rest. When he does get up, he will often fall asleep pretty much as\n soon as we start driving somewhere, or if we sit and watch a movie or tv show, and just generally he seems over tired. <br><br>Some of his motivation for staying up so late is around friends who are currently not allowed to get online to play games until school (homeschool) and chores are done, often not getting online until midnight. Some of it is that he tells me after his friends get off, or if they aren&#39;t even able to get on, he just gets distracted with all he wants to do and before he knows it, it&#39;s very late. In a few months we will be moving back to the eastern part of the US which will put us 2-3 hours ahead of Arizona time, that&#39;s going to be interesting. If he&#39;s staying up until 2 or 3 to even begin playing with the other kids, planning anything during the daytime will be even more complicated. <br></div><div style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br>I&#39;ve asked the other mums if they would consider &quot;scheduling&quot; time in for the boys to play. I&#39;ve heard them say they would like their own children to go to bed earlier as well. I pointed out that if the motivation for staying up late (gaming/connection) was offered at an earlier time, the motivation to stay up so late might shift. I haven&#39;t received a response so far. I know both their houses have little folks in the house and I don&#39;t believe the other kids have ownership of computers they play on so that may be a stumbling block to an early morning time. But I suggested and early time- maybe even before their little ones are up and at it- depending on what time they get up, I&#39;m not sure of their exact routines. But anyway, my son was the one who suggested the early time to me, so he&#39;s willing to make the shift. But if it means losing out on his gaming time with his friends, he doesn&#39;t want to do\n it. I certainly understand that. <br><br>Another thing that is related but different and affected by the sleeping issues, is that he takes Parkour classes. Parkour, for those who don&#39;t know, is the art of learning to move efficiently and safely, under, over, and around obstacles. If you&#39;ve seen a Jackie Chan movie, you&#39;ve seen some Parkour ideas in play. Parkour is very physically demanding. The coaches, his dad and I have all encouraged my son to have additional times during the week in between classes where he is doing exercise or activity to help increase his stamina as he makes frequent comments about how tired or out of breath, or such similar things during the class. I have invited him to walk with me in the morning (I prefer) or even in the evenings though it makes it harder for me to sleep by doing that. His dad has invited him to go to the gym with him on his non PT days (he&#39;s in the military and has required physical training 3 days a week)\n either in the mornings or in the evenings after he&#39;s done with work. We&#39;ve offered to help him find a workout buddy if he doesn&#39;t want to exercise with us. We just invite, without comment even though he always says no. He wants to do Parkour but he doesn&#39;t seem inclined to put the extra effort into building his stamina that doing Parkour requires. Tonight was the first night back after the holiday break. 20 minutes into it, he was out of breath to the point his lungs were burning and he felt like he might fall over. He said it was more than the usual tired he gets during the class and he wanted to leave. We let the coach know my son wasn&#39;t feeling well and we were going to go. The coach was cool about it and gently reminded him to remember to do what he can to rebuild his stamina after he heals up from whatever is going on. <br><br>I&#39;m just wondering what thoughts you have, what you might suggest if it were your own kids or if you can point out\n something I can try to help him meet his desire to have lots of gaming time and his desire to be able to do Parkour. <br><br>Thanks. <br>LisaR<br></div></div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73377,"nextTopicId":73416}}
