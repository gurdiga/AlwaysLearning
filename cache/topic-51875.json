Maybe it&#39;s all part of a thesis...___<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, one of the ways I learned unschooling was to put time into<br/>\ngetting the right answers and writing some of the repetitive stuff on<br/>\nunschooling lists in answer to people&#39;s questions-- questions which came as<br/>\npredictably as clockwork. All this Q & A was immensely helpful to me. It was<br/>\na little like learning to sing a song, and after a while I got the tune well<br/>\nenough to sing it along. But if more in depth questions came up, I left<br/>\nthose to others unless I thought I could contribute a little from personal<br/>\nexperience as a sort of addendum, a little comment, or an additional example<br/>\nin the same theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got things wrong sometimes and totally appreciate any correction which<br/>\ncame not just from Sandra but others on the list too. Which is exactly what<br/>\nI am looking for. I&#39;m the kind of person who really wants to know how to<br/>\nunschool &quot;in my head&quot; before I actually put it into practice &quot;whole hog&quot;<br/>\nbecause I&#39;ve seen how unschooling works well for Karl, by what I&#39;ve done<br/>\nwith him so far. I&#39;d rather mess up my words and concepts on the lists than<br/>\nto mess them more than I absolutely have to with Karl (but I have messed up<br/>\nsome with him to and I can tell by his reaction where I need fine tuning).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how it will play out in later years when he reaches 12 because<br/>\nhe&#39;s 6 now. Plenty that I haven&#39;t unschooled yet will be by then, and those<br/>\nare things I can&#39;t say &quot;I get it&quot; about until I get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople who are still unconvinced of portions in the wholelife aspects of<br/>\nradical unschooling may know only parts of the &quot;tune,&quot; the parts they&#39;ve put<br/>\ninto practice in daily life long enough to try it out and see how it WORKS,<br/>\nbecause trying it out only to see how it does NOT work isn&#39;t a good trial<br/>\nsince it&#39;s certainly possible to do it wrong (<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/screwitup)\">http://sandradodd.com/screwitup)</a>. And any time questions are asked, people<br/>\nare only be able to sing the parts they know. Everything else about<br/>\nunschooling beyond that point is theoretical for those people.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are only a few broad things one can learn about unschooling theory:<br/>\nwhy, how/what to do.

My oldest is 15 soon to be 16, I&#39;ve been at it for over 10 yrs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quality of information that I keep seeing arise on the internet has gone down, except for a few select places.  There are far more sites on unschooling these days.  Folks can pick and choose where they want to get their information from.  The couple of places that I write at, are the ones that I&#39;ve chosen to put time into.  When there were only a handful of places to get information, the quality was greater because the concentration of the really good writers were focused in those places.  That just isn&#39;t the case anymore, except for the few places those wonderful writers have invested time in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI keep stumbling upon vague and/or bad unschooling advice and information.  Similar to the kind of parenting advice that one might get from a more mainstream advice forum, with pats on the back and folks telling other folks to &quot;keep up the wonderful work&quot; based on odd assumptions that everyone is unschooling wonderfully, when for all they know, the person on the other side of the screen still yells at their children.  I&#39;ve been a bit pampered over the years with the really good stuff, that the newer stuff that I&#39;m seeing is glaring in it&#39;s sub-quality!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is, if you have a 5 yr old, even if you have been parenting in such a way that makes unschooling successful, it makes you new-ish.  There have been really wonderful people that have young children that have written wonderful things, whose children are destined to have wonderful unschooling lives because the parents &quot;got it&quot; early on.  That&#39;s really cool, and I am seeing more of that.  Give it a couple of years and the writing comes with real experience.  I&#39;ve seen that with LOTS of people, including myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI, personally, have far less patience with new comer questions than Sandra.  I&#39;m way more inclined to put up links to either Sandra or Joyce&#39;s sites.  I&#39;m AMAZED all the time with Joyce&#39;s ability to answer new comer question eloquently over and over and over again!  It&#39;s an amazing skill.  What Sandra does that impresses me, is gets right to the core of a question, condenses thoughts and just goes straight to it.  Pam says things that really make sense, the way she takes ideas and turns them inside out and then puts them in writing has helped me enormously to rethink things.  Schuyler has a great way of bringing science into ideas (there&#39;s lots of other things that are wonderful about her too), and Deb creates humor and logic, back in the day when I saw Anne writing more, she brought in the gentle touch combined with personal accounts.  There are many writers that I could acknowledge, but these are the ones that have helped me the most.  Some more than<br/>\n others at various times and stages of growth.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with all that, if there were no distinctions between who is new with new person thoughts, it would deny the fact that there clearly ARE people who aren&#39;t.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with being new to an idea and asking questions.  All of us were at one time or another.  All those people that have been unschooling for years and write about it, at one time had 5 yr olds, just starting &quot;school&quot; age, who were coming to or came to understand unschooling and how to get it working well.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128237955,"authorName":"Beth Danicke","from":"&quot;Beth Danicke&quot; &lt;saremca@...&gt;","profile":"saremca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Is there any such thing as a &quot;newcomer&quot; question?","postDate":"1268266999","msgId":51876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3M0Y0OTM0MEYxQjQxMzk4QzBDQkMxRTdENzIyOUZCQEZBTUlMWVJPT00+","inReplyToHeader":"PDVDNDE4QUY0LTI5NDYtNEY1Ni1CODRELUY5ODYzNjVFMzc3RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVDNDE4QUY0LTI5NDYtNEY1Ni1CODRELUY5ODYzNjVFMzc3RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51875,"nextInTopic":51877,"prevInTime":51875,"nextInTime":51877,"topicId":51875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" That one actually made me laugh out loud.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-684423409\">&lt;&lt;Just - not - really - open - to - dialogue - ? ? ?<br/>\nSeriously?<br/>\nIs THAT a beginner-to-this-list question or WHAT?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat one actually made me laugh out loud.  I understand that unschooling can<br/>\nbe scary and unfamiliar for those who are new to it.  I well remember<br/>\njoining the Unschooling Discussion list 10+ years ago and feeling like I had<br/>\nstumbled into some alternate universe.  Everything seemed upside down<br/>\nbecause of the way I&#39;d been raised and schooled and what I&#39;d been taught to<br/>\nbelieve.  Deschooling takes time.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStep back and read and absorb and get familiar with this new thing and WHY<br/>\nit works as opposed to jumping in and challenging ideas and butting heads<br/>\nwith people who already KNOW why it works and are willing to share the<br/>\nsecret with you.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be frustrating to have people come in with negative attitudes (and<br/>\nmany of them seem to think that we&#39;ve never heard their particular &quot;why this<br/>\nwon&#39;t work&quot; ideas before) telling us we are wrong and that they know a<br/>\nbetter way, when it states very clearly in the &quot;welcome to the list&quot; email<br/>\nthat it&#39;s best to read and not post for a few weeks to get the feel of the<br/>\nlist.   I know it&#39;s probably unavoidable, but sometimes the whinging and<br/>\ncomplaining muddle up the really good, helpful discussion.  Those are the<br/>\ntimes that I appreciate the moderation of messages the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn happier news, my youngest is reading.  For real.  For fun.  Totally on<br/>\nhis own.  He&#39;s been sight reading for a while now, but I don&#39;t consider that<br/>\nreading for real.  I got up last night at 3 am and found him in his room<br/>\nwith his light on, reading manga.  I cannot remember who recommended the<br/>\nLegend of Zelda manga, but thank you to whoever it was.   Caleb will be 12<br/>\nin May.  My girls read much earlier, at 7 and 9, and sometimes it was hard<br/>\nto trust, but I printed out most of the late reader stories on Sandra&#39;s site<br/>\nand read through them whenever I started to doubt that he would read when he<br/>\nwas good and ready.  And now he is.  He read to me today for a good 15<br/>\nminutes.  It was really cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth D</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Is there any such thing as a &quot;newcomer&quot; question?","postDate":"1268263399","msgId":51875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDNDE4QUY0LTI5NDYtNEY1Ni1CODRELUY5ODYzNjVFMzc3RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":51876,"prevInTime":51874,"nextInTime":51876,"topicId":51875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It s been a tiring week for me, with people writing to me on the side trying to persuade me to be and to think differently, to give them what they want, to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-493872685\">It&#39;s been a tiring week for me, with people writing to me on the side  <br/>\ntrying to persuade me to be and to think differently, to give them  <br/>\nwhat they want, to live my life another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s what I do for fun volunteer work:<br/>\n<br/>\nthis list<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/unschooling<br/>\nhttp://lyricsgame/blogspot.com<br/>\nhttp://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com<br/>\nand some other things like those.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t WANT to do a whole bunch of other things.<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to do those things differently.<br/>\nI know I can&#39;t make everyone in the world happy.<br/>\nI never tried to make everyone in the world happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve declared and described what I&#39;m interested in doing, and what I&#39;m  <br/>\nwilling to do, and where.
