My three year old has been eating nothing but junk food all <br/>\nday.  Today he ate...a few breadsticks in the morning.  Nothing but <br/>\nsoda to drink all day.  A few bites of pizza for lunch, a pack of <br/>\ncupcakes.  Supper, a few bites of noodles and one bite of carrot.  <br/>\nHe&#39;ll probably want cookies tonight.  I don&#39;t know, it just doesn&#39;t <br/>\nseem healthy enough.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t work in a day or a week or a month.  It works when it&#39;s longterm <br/>\nand people around are modelling good choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSchool used to say every  meal should be balanced, and that itself was news <br/>\nand political correctness to try to get people into mainstream eating and <br/>\naway from the beans and tortillas or cornbread and beans (to speak for my own <br/>\nneighborhood&#39;s traditional non-meat dinners when I was a kid), to stress the <br/>\nimportance of protein and to encourage people to eat fruit and vegetables <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my mom was a kid they got oranges at Christmas only.  When my <br/>\ngrandmother was a kid they only ate what they could grow or trade with the <br/>\nneighbors.  Our worldwide variety of out-of-season-here (or Never will grow <br/>\nhere, wherever &quot;here&quot; might be) is recent and unnatural.  So for us to expect <br/>\nthat &quot;a balanced diet&quot; fifth-grade-health-book style is crucial to daily <br/>\nsurvival is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we balance out over a few days it&#39;s fine.  Some people need more protein <br/>\nthan others for their own personal blood-sugar/biochemical/metabolic <br/>\npurposes.  I get a headache if I go too long without protein.  Kirby does <br/>\ntoo. Marty and Keith never do.<br/>\nSome people crave juice (Keith) or carbohydrates (Holly, the skinniest person <br/>\nin our family).  By pre-deciding what people will eat, moms don&#39;t allow for <br/>\nindividual needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with TV or decisions about what to wear or other freedoms, a sudden <br/>\nchange from control to choice will result in a kind of shadow-show of what <br/>\nchoices really weren&#39;t allowed before.   If the choice-giving is new, kids <br/>\nWILL watch &quot;too much&quot; TV, or play video games an extremely long time, but <br/>\nit&#39;s either celebration or a frantic grab because of fear that the privilege <br/>\nwill be withdrawn.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;a few breadsticks in the morning.  Nothing but <br/>\nsoda to drink all day.  A few bites of pizza for lunch, a pack of <br/>\ncupcakes.  Supper, a few bites of noodles and one bite of carrot.  <br/>\nHe&#39;ll probably want cookies tonight. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like a lot of food.  Does he have the option to get more between meals <br/>\nif he&#39;s hungry?  If he&#39;s NOT hungry, compare his haul of yesterday to what <br/>\nsome of the other kids in the world had access to or were privileged to eat <br/>\nyesterday.  I bet if you counted the calories he was well within a healthy <br/>\nrange of intake.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was news about water consumption lately.  I&#39;ll put that in a different <br/>\npost.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8415,"nextTopicId":8435}}
