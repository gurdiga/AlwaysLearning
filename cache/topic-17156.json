What my kids don&#39;t usually consider is that the kids DON&#39;T just sit around playing with it whenever and however they please.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are reading The Meanest Doll in the World.  It is the sequel to The Doll People, which we really enjoyed.  I am reading it to the girls at bedtime and I am CENSORING as I read!  In this book, the two dolls become stowaways and end up spending a day in school.  They are so impressed by everything they have been *missing*.  I have actually been skipping sentences that refer to how glorious school is.  It just reeks of that &quot;school is so wonderful aren&#39;t you lucky to go&quot; attitude.   In case anyone wonders,  I do not recommend this book, although I do still recommend the Doll People.  It is a fun story.  We first listened to it on audio tape, but the book has nice illustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":163750020,"authorName":"tuckervill2@aol.com","from":"tuckervill2@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] TWO scary Halloween things","postDate":"1067869920","msgId":17206,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFjMi4xMTE5MjM1Yi4yY2Q3YzBlMEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17187,"nextInTopic":17215,"prevInTime":17205,"nextInTime":17207,"topicId":17156,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/1/2003 10:05:17 PM Central Standard Time, SandraDodd@aol.com writes: I don t think she ll want to go, and I think if she does go she","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-713466682\">In a message dated 11/1/2003 10:05:17 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> writes:<br/>\nI don&#39;t think she&#39;ll want to go, and I think if she does go she won&#39;t stay <br/>\nlong, but sheesh!!!

(&quot;My&quot; classroom -- shudder.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I left, I explained my reasons for doing so as clearly as possible to my students.  This is what one former homeschooler, new to schooling, wrote to me:<br/>\n&quot;I enjoyed having you as a teacher so much!  You are the first person that trusted me to make my own decisions for myself w/o really being accountable for everything.  I will always rember your philosophies, and may even use them a mom someday!  Thank-you for sharing!  Good luck on your future.

Of course, it was with a bunch of (christain) homeschoolers <br/>\nwho pickedo n her cause she was the only black kid with glasses they&#39;d <br/>\never seen (I only heard this afterwards!) and there was a great deal of <br/>\nmisbehaving and very little learning, oh wait--that is a real school <br/>\nexperience, she just had it one day a week for a semester instead of <br/>\nfive days a week. <br/>\n<br/>\nLexie went trickor treating as a gymnist.  Janene as Tinkerbell.  This <br/>\nis the very first year both my girls went as relatively female <br/>\ncharacters.  Last year Lexie was a dictionary and Janene was Dobby.  The <br/>\nyear before Janene was a pirate and Lexie was something else masculine.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
