I&#39;m really curious about why people wouldn&#39;t <br/>\neven want the question asked, since we&#39;re dealing with real kids in the real <br/>\nworld.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people took her the wrong way.  She was simply asking a question, and <br/>\nI think some of the members took it as she was accusing them of being part of <br/>\nsome child pornography thing or something.  But outside of this group, the <br/>\nones that I have belonged to on unschooling have really seemed to be a bunch of <br/>\npeople that flame others with different opinions or understandings of <br/>\nunschooling.  It seemed like TV was the big thing, there were so many differing views <br/>\non TV, and I saw quite a few all out wars this summer regarding TV and <br/>\nunschooling on some groups.  It got to the point where I was rethinking my decision <br/>\nto unschool based on the way some of these so called adults acted.  Every <br/>\nhousehold is different and every household has things that work and things that <br/>\ndon&#39;t work, and like in homeschooling, there are a million ways to do things, it <br/>\nseems that in unschooling, there are a million ways to do things, it&#39;s all in <br/>\nwhat works in your individual families. I appreciate that this group seems to <br/>\nbe able to ask questions and state opinions without being harassed by people <br/>\nwith differing views.  I hope that all made sense.
