He loved it and the instructor,  but the instructor lost her place.  He has asked since then about lessons.  About once a year he&#39;ll bring it up and we&#39;ll try to find a place, but we could never find a place close enough to do this long term.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  he asked last week about it.  I found out through contacts that the lady he connected with so well is doing lessons again fairly close to us.  We talked to her today.  He will have his first lesson next Tuesday.  She wants to do a few private lessons to get a feel for what he remembers, she remembers that he took to the saddle really well, and then move him into a group.  I think this will work out great as a group experience for him.  He will have to follow the group rules due to safety, respect for the other riders and the horse, waiting his turn, etc.  But he will also be very active.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is not the same as sitting through something and having to be silent and waiting his turn but hopefully this will meet his needs - where he is now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s expensive too!  ; )<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is very excited - talking about owning his own horse some day, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: summer camps & classes","postDate":"1184600630","msgId":29924,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkyNDg4MEQyLTI2RUUtNDhEOC04RkVGLThEMEE0RkUzRTA0OUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwOGEwMWM3YzdhYSQ0MWM5Y2IyMCQ3OTBhMWU0MUB1c2VyZTM4NWNiM2FkMD4=","referencesHeader":"PGY3ZXA3OSs2NnQ5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NjMzRTkxMDUtQ0Q1Ni00QjU0LThEMDAtQTU0RDBDMDMyQ0Q1QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+IDwwMDhhMDFjN2M3YWEkNDFjOWNiMjAkNzkwYTFlNDFAdXNlcmUzODVjYjNhZDA+"},"prevInTopic":29923,"nextInTopic":30011,"prevInTime":29923,"nextInTime":29925,"topicId":29816,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-When we first got it last month he walked around playing with it for about a week - he took it everywhere he went.

It&#39;s  <br/>\nnot an Asperger&#39;s situation--he&#39;s extremely high on the  <br/>\ninterpersonals business, can read people like magic, but he&#39;s not the  <br/>\nquietest or most tactful or patient of people.  Holly and I were  <br/>\ndiscussing taking him with us to a formal in-costume discussion in  <br/>\nanother state.  (SCA context, so SCA costume.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly suggested that if we put him in a costume, and he sees all the  <br/>\nother costumes, he wouldn&#39;t be able to sit still and be calm and  <br/>\nquiet for two or three hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said then we make sure he has paper and pencils.  Holly agreed, and  <br/>\nsaid he needs to be sitting at a table.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis friend of ours draws.  He does pencil drawings while he&#39;s  <br/>\ntalking, while he&#39;s eating, while he&#39;s on the phone.  He&#39;s working  <br/>\nfor a dancing-tree logo for my website.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t draw, but I do fully and physically understand the value of  <br/>\ndoodling to keep my hyperactive tendencies under my own control.  In  <br/>\nchurch, I was able to sit still for an hour because there were songs  <br/>\nto sing sometimes, but during sermons (which I DID listen to and  <br/>\nunderstand, and often looked up the passage to find how HORRIBLY out  <br/>\nof context the preacher was taking it, or to find something he so  <br/>\nTOTALLY could have tied in but he had missed it)...  During sermons I  <br/>\nwould write on the program.  I would mark parts of words out to make  <br/>\nit say other things, or count the times &quot;the&quot; was used or color in  <br/>\nthe &quot;o&quot;s or circle some words and number them and then put a code to  <br/>\ngo from word to word and pass it to my friend Martha who, if she  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t playing the piano or organ that day, would trade programs and  <br/>\nI&#39;d see what she&#39;d done to hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could do it very unobtrusively and we didn&#39;t disrupt the service.   <br/>\nWe were two of the best kids at church--helpful, dedicated, but  <br/>\nwithout the ability to chill to a standstill.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if our friend goes with us to Denver we will provide him a good  <br/>\nplace to sit where he can draw, and we&#39;ll debrief him all he wants  <br/>\nlater and on the drive home, and explain the things that were too  <br/>\nforeign for him to get.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly&#39;s right, though, that if we just dressed him up and put him in  <br/>\na candlelit environment with a bunch of strangers it wouldn&#39;t calm  <br/>\nhim, it would excite him and he&#39;d likely say things and act ways we&#39;d  <br/>\nwish to undo.   He&#39;ll be happier if we help him hear the stuff  <br/>\nwithout disrupting it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t even have invited him, because he&#39;s not in the SCA, but he  <br/>\nsaid on Saturday that he&#39;s sorry he missed last winter&#39;s philosophy  <br/>\ndiscussions and he would love to be in a discussion about honor and  <br/>\nvirtue.

That&#39;s where I&#39;m getting the idea that there&#39;s a lot <br/>\nof &quot;coaching&quot; going on in a lot of different environments. Coaching <br/>\nhas its use, but if a parent is frequently trying to tell a child <br/>\nhow to behave or what the expectations are, that&#39;s going beyond <br/>\nsituational coaching. That&#39;s problematical. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We have had many talks about being your true authentic self in <br/>\n&gt;various ways for various situations. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why &quot;many talks&quot;?

Maybe you&#39;re <br/>\nputting him in situations where he has to wait longer than he&#39;s <br/>\nreally capable of waiting. That&#39;s not the sort of thing where <br/>\nsomething needs to be explained to him - he needs to be in different <br/>\nsituations that meet his needs better. That&#39;s part of what I meant <br/>\nin another post when I talked about facilitating successful <br/>\ninteractions. One way to do that is to look for ways to put kids in <br/>\nsituations that they can really handle - not ideally handle or <br/>\neven &quot;reasonably&quot; handle by some external standard. If your guy <br/>\nfeels like he &quot;never&quot; gets a turn, look for ways for him to get a <br/>\nturn more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I sometimes wonder if he does not read other&#39;s body language cues -<br/>\n&gt; so we&#39;ve been working on pointing out other&#39;s cues to him. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Does that seem to help him understand? I&#39;ve seen people use this <br/>\nstrategy, but I&#39;ve never been able to tell if the child in question <br/>\nactually understood more as a result or just got the hint to chill <br/>\nout. It didn&#39;t seem to do more than frustrate Ray the few times I <br/>\ntried it when he was younger. It may be that it is exactly the right <br/>\nhelp for certain kids, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf he doesn&#39;t seem to be understanding more about body language <br/>\ndespite having it pointed out to him, I&#39;d drop the matter and look <br/>\nat reasons *why* he might not be seeming to understand body <br/>\nlanguage.

My son went to a developmental school  up <br/>\nthrough 3rd grade, I pulled him out last year (after the teacher  yelled at <br/>\nhim one to many times). So we&#39;ve spent the last year  deschooling. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe asked me if he could take some classes this summer, and reluctantly, I  <br/>\nenrolled him (after talking to the person in charge who assured me that these  <br/>\nclasses were just for fun...no pressure classes). So he was signed up to  take <br/>\ncomputers and arts and crafts. He came home after 2 days  crying that the <br/>\ncomputer class was going to fast for him and he felt that he  couldn&#39;t keep up. I <br/>\nspoke to the teacher and explained my son&#39;s  situation and he basically said <br/>\nthat if my son would pay attention he&#39;d  be able to keep up!  UGH! A simple <br/>\nreminder to both of  us why were aren&#39;t in school anymore!<br/>\n <br/>\nSo now he&#39;s taking a science class. I spoke to the teacher beforehand and  <br/>\nshe assured me that there was no writing in class and that they were going  to <br/>\nspend mornings making paper airplanes and slime. So far so  good. (Although the <br/>\narts and crafts teacher wasn&#39;t too happy when my son  quoted Austin Powers <br/>\nwhen they were discussing volcanoes...).<br/>\n <br/>\nHe also just spent a week away at camp in the mountains. I noticed in his  <br/>\nthings there were some writing assignments...just simple fill in stuff and he  <br/>\ntold me he had no problems with it, and his spelling and writing are still very <br/>\n inventive. He was so happy to be at camp, that I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t even <br/>\nremember  having to write at all. It was no big deal.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy son is also very social and he&#39;s very athletic too, so there are a  lot of <br/>\nsituations where we&#39;re with schooled kids and it can be difficult.  Usually <br/>\nmy husband or I are with him, so we can discuss things with him  afterwards.<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I would talk to the person in  <br/>\ncharge and ask about the &quot;academic&quot; part of the camp (if there is one). If  <br/>\nthere&#39;s a lot of schoolish like stuff, I&#39;d opt out (unless your son really wants  <br/>\nit).

My question is, how do you address the schoolishness ?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to set my son up for a situation where he is ridiculed by other children or adults about his level of writing - or even his own feelings of being inadequate - self comparison - been there done that with public school until mid 3rd grade. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlus - Our son is very social and very, very talkative.  He will monopolize a conversation if he can, especially with the adult (he really picks their brains) and he will talk to adults like an equal.  There was an incident last winter where the group activity leader initiated all the other children in the group to take a vote:   for Zac to have to be silent the rest of the group time.  arrrrrrrrr  - that was a homeschool group activity where hubby was present.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to offer some of the camps that are available around here - we have camps available at science city, zoo, etc. that I think our son might be interested in except that he will not write & cannot spell. (he spelled sorry &quot;sre&quot; yesterday - if you say the letter sounds s-r-e it sounds like sorry; not all his spelling is this way but some of it is)  In fact he is just beginning to write a bit this summer all spontaneously on his own and I&#39;d hate to inadvertently crush that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I offer these camps to our son and let him choose?   Do I not offer in order to &quot;protect&quot; him - staying open to the possibility of these activities later on ? <br/>\n<br/>\n We have been homeschooling / unschooling for 4.5 years - went straight from public school to unschooling.  He just turned 13.  - we don&#39;t want to have to begin deschooling all over ; )  But I don&#39;t want to over protect either. I don&#39;t tend to speak up for what our needs are (I dislike confrontations), I tend to withdraw to where we are happiest, path of least resistance. <br/>\n<br/>\n We have attend many &quot;classes&quot; where one or both of us were available to go along and sit beside our son and write for him & work along side of him but those are usually classes designed for parents to be involved so there were always a few other parents in attendance also (it did not stick out that he was the only one with a parent beside him)  We have also attended many activities where we sat in the back, available for assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he did chose to attend how could we help him and should we have a discussion with the people running the activity ?<br/>\n<br/>\nDo those of you that have children that attend these types of classes and camps ask the leaders before hand about how much schoolishness there will be. (not in those words of course - but details about requirements for reading, writing, sitting still & mute, etc.)   - then present all that information to your child - and then of course they choose what they want to do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be essential to go over with the instructors and your child?<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30065,"nextTopicId":30080}}
