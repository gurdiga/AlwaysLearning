I&#39;ve talked to him about different ideas on how different people handle the subject - prayer, meditation, Law of Attraction. I&#39;ve been modeling these things to him in my actions. (I don&#39;t mention the word &quot;depression&quot; or &quot;pessimism&quot; because I don&#39;t want him locked into a label.) But many days he is still stuck in this unhappy rut.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually it starts when he&#39;s tired (a whole &#39;nother topic - I&#39;ll post that one too) or when things aren&#39;t happening the way he would prefer. He says things like &quot;My life is horrible&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m going to have another bad day today!&quot; &quot;Everyone hates me.&quot; &quot;Nothing good ever happens.&quot; &quot;I hate myself/I&#39;m stupid/etc&quot;. He&#39;s even gone so far as to say he wishes he would die or he wants to kill himself. An 8 year old!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I try to talk to him about what I do to, he doesn&#39;t want to hear it. If I dare mention that being happy is a choice, that you can choose to look at the good things or the bad things, etc he tells me that he can&#39;t choose to be happy because life sucks too much. I&quot;m trying not to become frustrated because I know that where he is at, that will only feel like abandonment. But I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end. I thought that this was mostly residual stuff from a crappy school experience (life really did suck back then) but after over a year and no school in sight, I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s more than that and I&#39;m wondering if I should take him to a naturopath/homepath. This isn&#39;t something we dealt with before school, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only personality (how some people tend to see the glass half empty). But I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s habit or if it&#39;s more serious thn that either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions or ideas?<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nTara<br/>\nOur Unschooling Blog:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://heartschooling.blogspot.com\">http://heartschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nWorried about the environment?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://SustainableSundays.blogspot.com\">http://SustainableSundays.blogspot.com</a> <br/>\nWorried about the economy?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=0EZeNulOz9E\">http://youtube.com/watch?v=0EZeNulOz9E</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnijgIbm1qc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnijgIbm1qc</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and <br/>\nknow-it-all with Yahoo!
