But you<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t need a set of fun boxes - you need a home with cool stuff in it.<br/>\n&gt; There is something too pre-planned about this. Like a kid has to pull<br/>\n&gt; out a box and now it is &quot;countries of the world&quot; time. What if they are<br/>\n&gt; into sewing as part of making the costume and decide to sew a stuffed<br/>\n&gt; animal panda and you look online for a pattern and find a live webcam on<br/>\n&gt; the panda&#39;s at the zoo in China and decide to name the Panda a Chinese<br/>\n&gt; name so you start looking for Chinese names and what they mean and that<br/>\n&gt; leads to a discussion about superstitions and you start thinking of<br/>\n&gt; superstitious sayings you&#39;ve heard and you decide to play &quot;Wise and<br/>\n&gt; Otherwise&quot; (board game based on sayings from countries all over the<br/>\n&gt; world and ......&quot; that is how unschooling works. You&#39;re boxing up the<br/>\n&gt; fun into separate categories - the storage of things in boxes won&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; hurt, but thinking about learning in this categorical way  will slow<br/>\n&gt; down the deschooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Some comments - maybe will hep you broaden your thinking on this:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; sports (jiu jitsu)  --- how does this fit into a box? Do they go to a<br/>\n&gt; jiu jitsu studio or watch a video or ? We call it doing a sport, not<br/>\n&gt; using a funbox.<br/>\n&gt; games - again, how can they fit into a box, most unschoolers have a<br/>\n&gt; games cupboard (or an entire games closet or games all over the house).<br/>\n&gt; Again, we call it playing a game.<br/>\n&gt; crafts (dalek costume) - we all probably have crafts materials in the<br/>\n&gt; house, stored in boxes or somehow. They are our crafts boxes. And<br/>\n&gt; keeping a box for all the stuff being used on that one costume seems<br/>\n&gt; useful. The Dalek costume box.<br/>\n&gt; music (guitar) - we have a lot of music - it is in different places in<br/>\n&gt; the house depending on where it gets used. But we have a big basket full<br/>\n&gt; of music called &quot;the basket of music.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; writing - paper? pens? stationary? notebooks? Don&#39;t most houses have<br/>\n&gt; this kind of stuff - in desks or drawers? Why in a &quot;funbox?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; Knitting - I keep my knitting supplies in tote bags. My daughter keeps<br/>\n&gt; hers in boxes.

I think it&#39;s probably because most of you have very different things in your homes than we have.***<br/>\n<br/>\nHmmm, the reactions don&#39;t seem negative to me.  It seems clear to me that you guys are in the midst of deschooling.  That was my initial reaction even BEFORE I read that you&#39;d only been at this for 4 months.  There&#39;s something to the idea that fun should come in boxes that are categorized that is very schoolish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of a funbox sounds cool at first glance.  It&#39;s like a treasure box or a treasure hunt maybe?  However, when you really think about the whole concept of a funbox filled with categorized items, it brings up some underlying problems that won&#39;t mesh with unschooling.  Take one funbox idea... a box full of Costa Rica for instance; how long will it take to compile such a box?  What will go into it?  Who decides?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have one or two kids that are interested in learning about Costa Rica, why not spend that time learning about Costa Rica?  Why put it in a box?  Once it&#39;s in a box, it&#39;s there, the idea all tied up in a little box, but really learning about Costa Rica is so much more than what could ever fit into a box.  I could see a kid wanting to put Costa Rica treasures into a box as they learn about neat things and print out pictures and such. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy oldest did that when she was wanting a dog, before we had one, she spent many hours learning about dogs, compiling a picture album of dogs, naming them and creating stories around them.  It wasn&#39;t something I facilitated other than to get her a binder and make sure she had printer paper and a working computer.  I never suggested that she do this thing, it was all her idea that came from a real need to categorize all these dogs/potential pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not that funboxes aren&#39;t or couldn&#39;t be fun.  They just seem a bit contrived.  When you are really in the deschooling process, it&#39;s probably better to not do things that are not contrived.  Spend time together, get out and do things, explore the world away from categories and boxes and subjects, step away from schoolish ways of doing things and thinking about things.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160276266,"authorName":"Amanda&#39;s Shoebox","from":"&quot;Amanda&#39;s Shoebox&quot; &lt;amandasshoebox@...&gt;","profile":"amandasshoebox","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Funboxes & Mild Math Freakout","postDate":"1277237363","msgId":55204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh2cjU5aittdGFiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2cjRoYytnOG5vQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55202,"nextInTopic":55205,"prevInTime":55203,"nextInTime":55205,"topicId":55140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They are fun boxes filled with things they would like to have in the house to do... filled with supplies for projects they&#39;ve been wanting to do (like my 13 year old&#39;s dalek costume). And I&#39;m not structuring their time at all in any way. They can use the things in the boxes or not. There is no requirement to use anything from the boxes at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have to look at the result of the funboxes, which is their excitement to have some things they&#39;ve been wanting to do for a while available for them. The thing about my girls is, they rarely ask for anything. It&#39;s difficult for me to get them to fill out &quot;Christmas wishlists&quot; and the like. I have to ask them what they want in order to be able to provide those things to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Amanda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":160276266,"authorName":"Amanda&#39;s Shoebox","from":"&quot;Amanda&#39;s Shoebox&quot; &lt;amandasshoebox@...&gt;","profile":"amandasshoebox","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Funboxes & Mild Math Freakout","postDate":"1277234050","msgId":55196,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh2cjIyMitudjVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENFNTk0RTIyLTRFM0QtNDY3My05RDU4LTlCRjREMDREOTlCNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":55192,"nextInTopic":55201,"prevInTime":55195,"nextInTime":55197,"topicId":55140,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s just that, as I read that, I pictured a box labeled &quot;Math&quot; filled with workbooks and I just found it funny, because it seems pretty ridiculous for unschoolers to have a box like that (unless they have a child who would enjoy something like that of course). I wasn&#39;t laughing at you, but at the image in my head. I have a weird sense of humor I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been trying to figure out why I&#39;ve been receiving such a negative reaction. I think it&#39;s probably because most of you have very different things in your homes than we have. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor reasons I won&#39;t bore you with, before we moved into the house we currently live in a few months ago, we got rid of most of our things. We only kept what could fit in one of those storage pods. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe haven&#39;t really had many interesting things for the kids to do here except for books they don&#39;t want to read again, 4 or 5 boardgames, cards, very few craft supplies (cardboard, paper, markers, crayons, colored pencils, some googly eyes and pipe cleaners), the pool and their laptops.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, we had been participating in activities with our homeschooling group 2 or 3 times a week, but that&#39;s stopped because they don&#39;t do much during the summer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it may have appeared that the funboxes were a result of my mild math freakout (which wasn&#39;t really a freakout, but more like an hour of self doubt that was mostly resolved by reading, thinking and talking about the what and why of our reasons for unschooling), when in reality, the self doubt came after I was looking for things to fill their funboxes with. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if I had called them toy boxes, what I was trying to accomplish (providing a variety of interesting things for my kids to do), wouldn&#39;t have gotten such a negative reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding what you all are trying to say to me?<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciated the deschooling link.
