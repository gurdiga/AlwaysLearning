We&#39;ve got the dual LNB ( <br/>\nthe oval3 dish) and after a lot of bumbling about with the remote, figured <br/>\nout how to switch between the two tuners.  I think I also figured out how <br/>\nto tape the shows (not just do the 30 minute delay thing), but we&#39;ll know <br/>\nfor sure later today.  I found out yesterday that we&#39;d pay the same monthly <br/>\nrate for what we have (a tivo and a separate receiver) as we would for two <br/>\ntivo receivers!  Argh!  I wish I&#39;d known earlier!  I could have had them <br/>\nrun lines for two tivos&#39;!  Ah well.  Live and learn and she seems very <br/>\nhappy with her plain old receiver.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boy&#39;s been on the TV all day with his new gamecube and Zelda, so I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t really had much chance to play with the Tivo.  He&#39;s been gracious <br/>\nenough to give me an hour or two now and then during the day!  (big <br/>\ngrin)  He&#39;s so excited, but I think we&#39;re going to have to find a decent <br/>\nused TV so we can free up the TV in the front room.<br/>\nThanks for the advice!<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;wow, 130,000 troops on the ground, nearly 500 deaths and over a billion <br/>\ndollars a day, but they caught a guy living in a hole. am i supposed to be <br/>\ndazzled?&quot;<br/>\nEmail sent by an SPC in the US Army who wishes to remain anonymous.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17707,"nextTopicId":17660}}
