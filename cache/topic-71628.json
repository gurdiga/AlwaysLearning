A nice summary! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo strapping a curriculum on and feeding it through a tube on the sly isn&#39;t quite as good?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m asking facetiously because in a couple of recent conversations I&#39;ve found that some people have avoided &quot;subject matter&quot; because it might be too-schoolish to discuss it, but I didn&#39;t, when my kids were little.  If I could easily work it into a conversation and I was aware for some reason that they didn&#39;t know it, and I was pretty sure that someday they might want to, if something similar came up, I would mention it.  I still do that.  I do that with my husband and my friends, sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that come up naturally in everyday life that are also discussed and presented at school.  How voting works.  Quotation marks.   Metallic elements and alloys.  The difference between an amphibian and a reptile.  If it&#39;s right there and can be brought up conversationally, I don&#39;t stop  myself with the thought that the information is also on the school curriculum.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo about whether a La Leche League leader is being manipulative by asking questions that will lead a mom to a thoughtful conclusionï¿½it doesn&#39;t seem so to me.

So if it&#39;s a kind of manipulation, it still doesn&#39;t seem evil or cruel to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a discussion such as this one, though, we have no reason to dodge or demur.  It&#39;s not about making money.  There are no memberships.  We&#39;re not in danger of giving advice that pediatricians would dispute.

Reading on a list like this might be difficult and draining for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they don&#39;t have the ability to &quot;read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot; Maybe they have super high expectations for themselves and are comparing themselves to an imagined perfect unschooling mom who seems to have it all together all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they reach too far, too fast and aren&#39;t able to gracefully pick themselves up when it doesn&#39;t work out for them. Perhaps it makes them feel extra vulnerable and sensitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they think everyone is like this and needs to be rescued from the continual stretching and growth that a list like Always Learning encourages you to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don&#39;t think that is true for everyone. For me the list is a source of inspiration. When I hit a roadblock, I don&#39;t get in a bad mood and think I&#39;m a terrible person. I&#39;m pretty lighthearted about it. I pick myself up and try to do better the next time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t really look to other mothers for validation on how I&#39;m doing as a parent. I look to my children and my husband. If they are generally happy, relaxed, comfortable and engaged, I feel pretty good about how I&#39;m doing. If they are often stressed, frustrated, uneasy and distant, it wouldn&#39;t matter if every mother in the world voted me to be the best mom in the universe. I would still know that I was letting down my own family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is one of ways the unschooling discussions on this list help me. If I see signs of frustration or stress or uneasiness in my family, there are alarm bells going off inside me telling me I need to be kinder, pay extra close attention, have more ideas, and offer more options. <br/>\n<br/>\nRippy <br/>\n(Gianluca 8, Gisele 6)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":301108410,"authorName":"Marina DeLuca-Howard","from":"Marina DeLuca-Howard &lt;delucahoward@...&gt;","profile":"matedgirl","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Odd philosophical questions","postDate":"1371738022","msgId":71647,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUENTNkFVUGRnblpUNTg1RDl0OHp4RWQrQjNnNWZOdUFMN3RMVGRTQVNaTkd4YzFzd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJDQzQzRUZDLTQxNTktNDA5RC05MUZGLTgzQzJGRjUwMEJCREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVGOTQyQ0EzLTFGOTctNDA2NC04MTEyLTg0RTY2MDNCNzJBRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGtwc3Fubis3NmE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FQQ1M2QVZoMUxORz0wSzkyaTlGLVBCbT1uK0VXd210NExPaV9HcGFXT1U5Yi1hbmtRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8QkNDNDNFRkMtNDE1OS00MDlELTkxRkYtODNDMkZGNTAwQkJEQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71646,"nextInTopic":71649,"prevInTime":71646,"nextInTime":71648,"topicId":71628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra wrote, -=- LL prides itself on the art of not giving advice and supporting any breastfeeding is good stances.-=- You re put not giving advice in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-125289232\">Sandra wrote,<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- LL prides itself on the art of &quot;not giving advice&quot; and supporting any<br/>\n&quot;breastfeeding&quot; is good stances.-=-<br/>\nYou&#39;re put &quot;not giving advice&quot; in quotes, and that must have a hidden<br/>\nmeaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, yes.

I remember I had trouble with this though<br/>\nbecause I was being told to manipulate people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIE I felt dishonest telling a mother who was pregnant and going to deliver<br/>\nand planning a two week Mexican holiday some vague answers. She planned on<br/>\nexpressing her milk and sending it via courier. I remember thinking this<br/>\nwas silly, unworkable and wanting to ask &quot;why&quot; she was not bringing the<br/>\nbaby. Instead I gave her information and suggested sources. As the mother<br/>\nof three from my experience, from books, and from anything I had ever<br/>\nunderstood about having a baby, let alone breastfeeding taking a vacation<br/>\nwithout the newborn seemed the most ridiculous thing.  Even if you aren&#39;t<br/>\nplanning to breastfeed who leaves a week or two postpartum? Who leaves a<br/>\none or two week baby to go on vacation with her husband?  But I was able to<br/>\nfollow the La Leche Code and make bland comments--I told her about nipple<br/>\nconfusion, plugged ducts and the logistics of getting milk in cold storage<br/>\nand shipped back to Canada. I did venture to ask &quot;have you considered<br/>\nbringing a nanny and taking the baby&quot; so you can avoid the messiness of<br/>\npumping milk and sending it home.  I did mention the caregiver would<br/>\nprobably need to supplement with formula, which she was concerned about.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe actually had leaders meetings where I brought this particular case<br/>\nup...but the consensus was you can only answer questions and give out<br/>\ninformation and try to be non-judgemental. Yes, mention engorgement,<br/>\nbonding, nipple confusion, supplementing, and the unwieldy plan of shipping<br/>\nmilk back.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever, I ran into trouble I would adjourn the meeting though and then it<br/>\nstopped being a La Leche Meeting and was then a free meeting.  We were told<br/>\nto spout, &quot;La Leche believes&quot; but not to contradict nurses, midwifes,<br/>\ndoctors, or professionals although we could recommend those books you<br/>\nmentioned in the vetted library written by professionals who did just that<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were &quot;breastfeeding mothers&quot; who showed up at meeting who were using<br/>\nassisted nursing with taping tubes to their bodies and using formula.<br/>\nThere were adoptive mothers who really wanted to breastfeed but didn&#39;t<br/>\nproduce milk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, when people hit unschooling they find it jarring that only unschooling<br/>\nis considered unschooling :) IE you have a child at home of school age and<br/>\npartner with them to build a safe nest for them in a family home to have a<br/>\nhappy life and to follow their natural inclinations which lead to learning<br/>\nand acquiring skills along the way which lead to independence one day.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n-- <br/>\nWhen will our consciences grow so tender that we will act to prevent human<br/>\nmisery rather than avenge it?

Many people seem to want to use unschooling as a tool to challenge the establishment, and to rebel against a lifetime of real and/or perceived enforced contraints.  They seem to see unschooling as an opportunity to finally hold on to something, define it for themselves, and claim it as their own.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, if the goal of unschooling is to help our children learn to be contributing, successful, and hopefully happy members of our existing society, then there are definitely better ways in which we, as parents, can help our children potentially achieve this.  It means, however, that we need to be willing to listen to those who have gone before us, who have a few/many stories, ideas, and clarifications worth sharing.  It also means we need to walk away from the ideas of unschooling as freedom, of unschooling as rebellion, of unschooling as asserting our uniqueness and individualism.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it was Issac Newton who said that his own success in furthering the collective understanding in physics and math came from standing on the shoulders of giants.  In my opinion, people that reject discussions on what defines and makes unschooling more successful, not only harm themselves, but they also risk lessening the foundation upon which an even greater understanding of unschooling can be built. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Odd philosophical questions","postDate":"1371495921","msgId":71636,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzE0OTU5MjEuNDIzMzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGtwbmkxayt0cDFyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtwbmJqcCs2Y25nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8a3BuaTFrK3RwMXJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":71635,"nextInTopic":71637,"prevInTime":71635,"nextInTime":71637,"topicId":71628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Â  On top of that, some people want to be... elders or wise women or teachers or gurus - or just plain helpful.

It seems to me that some people care more about calling themselves unschoolers and impressing others with their anti-establishment views, than about children having awesome lives.  It&#39;s uncomfortable to those people, to see others caring about getting to the heart of what helps and hinders children.  It&#39;s a lot easier if accuracy and truth don&#39;t matter, or at least aren&#39;t brought up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have also found that those people often refer to the people who do care about getting to the heart of what works, as being obsessed with rules or some such.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;...&quot;radical unschooling,&quot; and its related rules...&quot; was mentioned in the quote.  I think &quot;rules&quot; here is used in a pejorative sense.  It seems to me that the true objection is to clarity about what works rather than about rules, because there are no unschooling &quot;rules&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works, requires something from them that they&#39;re unwilling to bring - presence, humility, compassion, kindness...   In order to feel better about doing what feels comfortable for them while calling it unschooling, they frequently refer to the care required for unschooling to work, as &quot;rules&quot;.   They seem to find comfort and confidence in people agreeing with them, rather than in knowledge.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people know how to make really awesome cakes.  They may get together with other passionate cake-makers.  They can share what they know about it, all the little things that come together to make the difference between just a cake and a great cake.  They will be building a body of knowledge full of gems about cake-making.  They are not making rules about how to make a great cake - they are sharing what works.  It&#39;s information - not rules.  To call it &#39;rules&#39; is a put-down used by those who don&#39;t care to take any extra effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nDebbie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Odd philosophical questions","postDate":"1371488100","msgId":71630,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVDNDBFQjZBLTZGQ0YtNEM4QS05Rjk1LTJCRTYyODU4Mzg2NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtwbmJqcCs2Y25nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtwbmJqcCs2Y25nQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71629,"nextInTopic":71631,"prevInTime":71629,"nextInTime":71631,"topicId":71628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think the ones who get upset believe that the experienced unschoolers are cliquey or fundamentalist and try to exclude people.
