Having let him make choices, you need to let the natural  <br/>\nconsequences play out for him.  That&#39;s how he&#39;ll learn when and how  <br/>\nto dress in ways of his choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nFriends for years doesn&#39;t guarantee friends for life, in any case,  <br/>\nwith anyone.  If he made his choices just to keep that friend it  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be any healthier than making his choices to keep his  <br/>\ngirlfriend happy.   Maybe help him consider the reasons for choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be wrong to condemn your friend for her attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve lost friends over the years.  In a discussion just a couple of  <br/>\nweeks ago about someone who&#39;s a friend of several people I know, I  <br/>\nmentioned that she has never warmed up to me because she was unhappy  <br/>\nI had homeschooled.  She&#39;s still waiting for me to send Kirby to  <br/>\nschool so she can be my friend again, I said.   And it&#39;s funny, since  <br/>\nhe&#39;s 21, but that&#39;s basically the deal.  She was kinda playing freeze- <br/>\nout with  me, and I chose Kirby over her.

If he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t need to fight for control in his own life, letting others  <br/>\nhave control of their own worlds, won&#39;t feel like a loss of control  <br/>\nto him.

DS usually doesn&#39;t say anything when she does that and<br/>\nhas said that&#39;s just her opinion and it doesn&#39;t get to him, but my guess is<br/>\non this particular occasion he stood up for himself.  She reasoned that is<br/>\nwas October after all and the month to play dress up and she let it ride.<br/>\nShe said on subsequent visits he was nicer and seemed more like himself. Now<br/>\nds has his girlfriend coming to visit for a week (who also likes to dress up<br/>\ngoth for some fun ---) and she really wants to meet friends dd.
