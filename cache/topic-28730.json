About two things--Florence is a great town, I loved living in a town on the river--lots of history there, and the Frank Lloyd Wright home is a must see (also known in that area as the Rosenbaum home).  It has been totally restored to its original beauty.  If you&#39;re ever in the Florence area again, be sure to find Fame recording studios (actually this is in Muscle Shoals right across the river from Florence) because everyone from Aretha Franklin to Elvis Presley to Jimmy Buffet to yes, Lynyrd Skynyrd has recorded music there (too many artists to list).  Oh, and Ivy Green, the home of Helen Keller is in this area and is a must see. Every summer they have a live production of the Miracle Worker on the grounds of her home, which is in Tuscumbia.  All of these cities are extremely close to one another, which is why they are referred to as the tri-cities.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Melody :-)<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kbcdlovejo@...\">kbcdlovejo@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When I finished the story I asked my son if he<br/>\n </span></blockquote>wanted to know what silkworms had to do with Florence, Alabama.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOHOHOH!
