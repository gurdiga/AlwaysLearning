Except on Fridays.  On<br/>\nfridays you can have doritos and ice cream for breakfast.  You can eat<br/>\nwhatever you want whenever you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be doritos and ice cream all day long on Fridays and then mom<br/>\nwill say &quot;See!

My<br/>\nkid will only eat junk all day long.&quot; and then will go back to<br/>\ncontrolling food 7 days a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the kid sees that coming, maybe they can figure out to eat a small<br/>\nenough amount so that mom doesn&#39;t freak... but that will only be<br/>\nbecause the threat is there.  It isn&#39;t the same thing as not being<br/>\ncontrolling about food.  It&#39;s just not not not the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that this stuff will work in general if it is done part<br/>\nway. I have heard people telling stories about backing off one area<br/>\n(e.g. &quot;we are unschooling writing&quot;) ended up helping, but I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink it is the same as actually unschooling and I think that the<br/>\nstories about how great things can be don&#39;t really apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe for this kid, backing off one day a week is a huge improvement<br/>\nand a great thing to do.  It could be really good for the child and<br/>\ntheir relationship. It isn&#39;t unschooling, though, and there will be<br/>\nvery big differences in a child that is actually unschooled and a<br/>\nchild whose mom backs off one day a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Tue, Jan 27, 2009 at 9:41 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Jan 27, 2009, at 9:23 AM, elwazani wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; so is that like becoming spiritually dissatisfied with say ....being<br/>\n&gt;&gt; Christian and so one day a week practicing...Islam?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; No, no.
