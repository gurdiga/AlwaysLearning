Maybe that&#39;s why they give so much homework, to make it total 40 hours. :-)  But these same young teens who aren&#39;t legally able to work in factories or even ice cream parlors, SHOULD they be doing anything &quot;full time?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo...<br/>\n<br/>\nI said 20.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a survey—the answers go into a pile as data to tumble around.  But what will &quot;20&quot; mean to them?  I had a BA in English at 20, because I finished high school at 16.  As races go, I &quot;won—not much, but just that... the oddity of being out &quot;young.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was 29, my husband got a BS in computer science (with a minor in theatre, when he was planning on a math degree—they &quot;graduated him&quot; to get him to stop living there at undergrad rates; I think he was messing up their stats and they hoped he would continue at the more expensive grad school fees, but he didn&#39;t).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some years in there when my husband wasn&#39;t enrolled at the university at all, and some when it was part-time.  So...  would he say 29 on an Apple survey?    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about Kirby who has never yet been in &quot;full-time education&quot;?  Unless unschooling would be considered that.  And if so... still, what would his response be?  18 when it wasn&#39;t state-mandated?  I never registered him after he was 8.  Would he say....  0?  Never started &quot;full-time education&quot;?  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72422,"nextTopicId":72502}}
