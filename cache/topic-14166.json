They do not hold the fears that I learned <br/>\nin school, and my mother was the person who kept me grounded and created that <br/>\nfor me too. It&#39;s funny how attending such a rigid porochial institution <br/>\nactually helped mold the person I am now also. In this life that school was <br/>\ninstrumental in my developing my own thoughts, something not acceptable in <br/>\ntheir view. I&#39;m sure most of you are wondering why I went at all since it was <br/>\nnot based on religion, I went because they were considered a top notch school <br/>\nwith entrance exams regardless of age. My parents wanted me to go somewhere <br/>\nthat had the ability to provide what I required.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have good memories of the school itself, but rather the bond I shared <br/>\nwith my parents as they strived to undo many of things I was taught on <br/>\nChristian principles. I used to get in trouble for things such as reading <br/>\nhoroscopes and telling people about their other lives, something <br/>\ncategorically deniable in the church. I think the school prayed everyday that <br/>\nI would fail at something so they could have foundation to expel my butt. I <br/>\nattended until 8th grade graduation and then chose to attend public school.  <br/>\nMy parents weren&#39;t happy in my choice, but let me make it. I wish I&#39;d know <br/>\nabout unschooling back then, It would have fit me as a person from the get <br/>\ngo. I often tell my girls that what I learned in school was what kind of <br/>\nperson I never wanted to be. I was self directed then and always allowed to <br/>\nwork on my own through the schools curriculum. This square peg never fit <br/>\ntheir round hole. However, I think it was at least kind of them to allow me <br/>\nto work that way. I guess it was better for them (teachers) too. The less <br/>\nthey had to address with me in class the better for them.LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy the book Holly, and remember to never judge a book by it&#39;s cover or <br/>\ntitle for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":132859234,"authorName":"Paula Sjogerman","from":"Paula Sjogerman &lt;sjogy@...&gt;","profile":"psjogy","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Judy Blume was: Funny Holly report","postDate":"1052497021","msgId":14174,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBRTEzRUFDLjFCNzMlc2pvZ3lAc2JjZ2xvYmFsLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNy4xZjViMTZkYS4yYmVkMjliZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14172,"nextInTopic":14175,"prevInTime":14173,"nextInTime":14175,"topicId":14166,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I went to a private <br/>\nChristian School most of my life and Judy Blume was censured. Any person <br/>\ncaught reading or discussing her books was up for, your gonna love this, <br/>\ncorporal punishment. That&#39;s right, the paddle. Of course I had parents who <br/>\nrefused to ever sign over the consent for anyone to ever strike me, besides <br/>\nwhich they have never done in my entire life, even when I was a <br/>\ncocky-know-it-all-teenager and more than likely deserved a pop in the mouth. <br/>\nThat was the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s and the school forgot that Scholastic <br/>\nbooks sold Judy Blume books just as they still do. My mom always let me order <br/>\nhowever many books I wanted because reading was a really big thing to me then <br/>\nas it is now. I told her I really, really wanted to read this book and she <br/>\nallowed me to order it. I explained that I would get in trouble for such a <br/>\nthing as to order a Judy Blume book. So what did my mom do? She ordered every <br/>\nJudy Blume book on the Scholastic form. I didn&#39;t even want the others, but <br/>\nshe insisted that there must be something great in these books if the school <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want me reading them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI turned in my order with everyone else and my mom received a phone call, at <br/>\nwork, no less, to say the school would not turn in my form. Bad choice in <br/>\ncalling my mother bear; for she said that was fine, she would contact <br/>\nScholastic and order direct and explain that the school was refusing books to <br/>\nher child. I think I was 10. This is one of my most vivid memories of my mom <br/>\ngoing to bat for me and all the other children for the sake of principle <br/>\nalone. She could have easily backed down and taken me to the bookstore <br/>\ninstead, but her point to the school was that they received benefit by having <br/>\na relationship with Scholastic Books and then to censure their catalog was <br/>\nethically inappropriate and that the decision as to what a child should/could <br/>\nread is between parent and child, not child and school. The school backed <br/>\ndown and sent in my order.<br/>\n<br/>\n I&#39;ll never forget the day the order arrived. The teacher called me up to the <br/>\nfront and said here&#39;s your order Rhonda, don&#39;t open it until you get home. I <br/>\nwas 10 and everyone else was tearing their orders open. So when I got to my <br/>\ndesk, tada, the Scholastic faeries ripped open my order. It was like in the <br/>\nmovies when everything is exaggerated, but I kid you not everyone gasped and <br/>\nsaid look at all those Judy Blumes.....oooooh, you&#39;re gonna get the paddle. I <br/>\nlaughed at them and said, don&#39;t be silly my mom and dad would never let <br/>\nanyone hit me. They turned their gasps to jaw drops and I sat down to look at <br/>\nmy books. When my mom picked me up, I told her what happened and we laughed <br/>\nthe whole way home. She said I&#39;d be really pushing it to try and take the <br/>\nbook back to school for &quot;free reading time&quot;, so that was translated in my <br/>\nbrain as, &quot;Sure take it to school I dare them to call me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, my luck is, Kass & Kree could care less about reading right now.  <br/>\nI often read these books still, not just because I am sitting on the hopes <br/>\nthat the girls will want to read them too, but because they bring back good <br/>\nmemories of my childhood and my relationship with my own mother. I never had <br/>\nto worry if my mom would go to bat for me, I&#39;m 33 now and she still has the <br/>\nsame mother bear tendancies, even worse sometimes with Kass & Kree the only <br/>\ngrandchildren. Luckily, although she doesn&#39;t quite get &quot;Unschooling&quot;, she <br/>\nreserves my right to do it and trusts my decisions. I remind her that she is <br/>\nthe one who molded who I am and that she should be proud to say I stand up <br/>\nfor myself and my children, just as she did for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, I&#39;m gonna start blubbering now, and I know I am rambling, but it just <br/>\noccured to me how lucky I was and I can only hope my children love and <br/>\nappreciate me one tenth of the amount I do my mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Mother&#39;s day to all of you...<br/>\nRhonda<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are dads here too, but Father&#39;s Day is next month, so don&#39;t get <br/>\nyour panties in a bunch.
