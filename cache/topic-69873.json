I was out with some friends having fun, but I wanted to leave early. People wanted me to stay. I explained that I wanted to get back before baby Gianluca woke up from his nap. I was excited to go home and see his little sleepy face and wanted to be there when he woke up. I loved that every time he woke up, I was always there. One of the women said something like, &#39;Oh - you&#39;re such a martyr&#39; with an unkind edge. She didn&#39;t understand why I would rush back home and leave the fun, when Graham was home and perfectly capable of taking care of our baby.

I remember when I was a new mom there was often a ritual of &#39;let&#39;s go around the circle and see who has the most difficult baby&#39; when moms got together. The only acceptable alternative to this was if someone sacrificed their husband instead of their baby for the ritual. There was a visceral appetite for negative stories and an expectation for everyone to share. <br/>\n<br/>\nI got a lot more selective about the company I kept by the time Gianluca was a toddler. I am especially attracted to parents that make better choices than me. Parents that are compassionate and kind in situations where I might struggle. Parents that raise my average.  I *love* being in their company and learning from their shining examples. <br/>\n<br/>\nEarlier this year we went on holiday with a couple of families and one of the toddlers was ill for the majority of the holiday. His mom was super sweet and attentive the entire five days of the holiday, with minimal sleep. She was patient, relaxed and nice to everyone. I&#39;m not sure I could have been that lovely. At one point during the holiday I got irritated with Gianluca because he was having a difficult time sharing a game. It was only a couple of minutes, but it was such a sharp contrast with the way my friend was with her child while he was struggling. I left the holiday a better parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think some people feel less than in the company of parents that may have a better set of tools than they currently possess.

This was the first thing I thought of when I read the original post.

Whether it&#39;s an alcoholic spouse or a large busy family or an unwell elderly parent it can be tempting to soak up the attention.  However, in the process it can cause a lot of harm to a family, because the focus is basically selfish.  It is something that takes a lot of work, a lot of self-awareness, to overcome.  Maybe this type of martyrdom is triggered by a basic unhappiness with your life combined with the lack of power to change it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people I think of as genuine martyrs, people who have endangered their lives for another person or for a principle, with no thought of benefit to themselves, but it seems to me it is very rare.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;â¦a martyr&quot;","postDate":"1356218200","msgId":69930,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtiNWYwbytuYW5wQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwMjBDOTM1MTQ1NzRGQ0NBMDUxQ0U4Q0VGNkRCNEM0QENocmlzdGluZUhQPg=="},"prevInTopic":69926,"nextInTopic":69936,"prevInTime":69929,"nextInTime":69931,"topicId":69873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My mom rebelled hard against the idea of being a martyr mom - she saw her mom that way and saw her martyrdom as coming from an inability or disinclination","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-236131249\">My mom rebelled hard against the idea of being a &quot;martyr mom&quot; - she saw her mom that way and saw her &quot;martyrdom&quot; as coming from an inability or disinclination to stand up against the men in her life. Grandma was a martyr to the patriarchy. My mom&#39;s rebellious motto was &quot;better a bitch than a doormat&quot; - a martyr, to my mom, was a doormat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a false dichotomy, though. There&#39;s a whole wide world of options in between passivity and being the hand that cracks the whip. <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth ends of that particular spectrum are held down by &quot;have tos&quot; - and to some extent the Same &quot;have tos&quot;.

My mom fought against being a perfect sacrifice to the point of being rather cold - strident in her emphasis that her coldness was out of love, but &quot;better a bitch than a doormat&quot;. I was glad to discover I didn&#39;t have to be a perfect anything - not a perfect bitch or perfect sacrifice or even a perfect person.

Not at all for the sake of what people thought of her, she did it all quietly and never complained that I can remember. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child, this seemed wonderful.

All I remember now is that at the time it meant very little to me, I could take more and more of whatever she gave me, as I tried to fill a hole that really couldn’t be filled that way. I felt bad that she wasn’t going to get her coat, but I had a huge need inside of me, and maybe that money might fix it. And she gave ever more and more, trying to make things right I think.

She travelled up and down the country to look after troubled cousins, she took in the drunk uncle when his wife threw him out, she did her mum’s laundry and shopping, bathed her, she made all my dance costumes and ones for all the other mums that couldn’t sew, well, I could go on at length. Running around her whole life, trying to look after everyone. We all thought she was amazing (she was), but I wish she had taken care of her own needs. She didn’t know how, and she was raised to always put others before herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecoming a mother myself gave me a little insight....I think my Mum was aware that she was unable to give me what I really needed, and she tried so very hard to make up for that by running herself ragged, giving me and the rest of our family all of her time. Which reading back sounds kind of wonderful, that she gave me so much time, and in many ways it was. But I wish she had taken that time for herself, more often. I might have felt the same lack, but she would have lived longer, and I would not have had the huge burden of guilt that I had. She did not soak up any appreciation or revel in any satisfaction that she was doing so much – she was genuinely worn out and stressed by her life. But she was unable to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in my mum’s case at least, the martyrdom was not ‘fake’, or done to get credit, but I do think it was an attempt at meeting her own needs. Perhaps to assuage guilt, perhaps to find a way to feel good about herself, perhaps an attempt to be a ‘good’ mother/wife/daughter/aunt/sister etc. I do know people that grumble about how much they do when in fact they are doing very little, but that is not the only type of ‘mother as martyr’. I’m sure my mum was not unique in genuinely sacrificing her own needs to try and do the right thing. She was generous, she was loving, but not to herself, and I think that was not healthy for her, or for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this isn’t too garbled, I have tried to write very carefully to describe my mum and a type of martyr I’ve not yet seen described.<br/>\n<br/>\nChristine <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130276955,"authorName":"Juliet Kemp","from":"Juliet Kemp &lt;juliet@...&gt;","profile":"julietkemp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: &quot;.a martyr&quot;","postDate":"1356206703","msgId":69922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMTIxMjIyMjAwNTAzLkdTMTkzMjhAdGhlLmVhcnRoLmxpPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwOEQyNTlDLUI1QkQtNDJEMS04OEYwLTI5MUZGODE0QkFGOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQwOEQyNTlDLUI1QkQtNDJEMS04OEYwLTI5MUZGODE0QkFGOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69918,"nextInTopic":69923,"prevInTime":69921,"nextInTime":69923,"topicId":69873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I too have felt a bit<br/>\nput on the spot occasionally. (my stock phrase is &quot;well, it works well<br/>\nfor us&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut an interesting thing I also thought is that there is a way of<br/>\nexpressing nearly-similar experiences in a positive way. I saw friends<br/>\nyesterday/today whose 6 mth old has a bad cold & will only sleep propped<br/>\nup on a sitting-up parent; my nearly-10 mth old is going through a<br/>\nsuper-frequent night-feeding patch; so all 3 of us were pretty tired!<br/>\nAnd we made a few jokes about it and commiserated a bit, and we played<br/>\nwith the kids and had a couple of lovely meals, and all that. But none<br/>\nof us (I think!) were doing the &#39;martyr&#39; thing & none of us were<br/>\ncomplaining or moaning or suggesting that we were &quot;sacrificing&quot;<br/>\nourselves. This are the things that are happening right now, and that&#39;s<br/>\nall fine. Soon enough it&#39;ll be something else happening, after all :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome bits of parenting are tough, sometimes, and saying &quot;wow, I&#39;m kind<br/>\nof knackered today&quot; to someone who has also been there can be helpful.<br/>\nBut turning it into the martyred &quot;poor me I am such a slaving<br/>\nself-sacrificing parent&quot; &quot;oh this is awful&quot; - yeah, I think that makes it<br/>\ntougher, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nA side-note: I wrote &quot;commiserated&quot; and then wondered if that was the<br/>\nright word if not expressing complaint, so I looked it up (thanks to<br/>\nSandra for suggesting this by example!). The OED has &quot; To sympathize or<br/>\nexpress sympathy with.&quot; (and a couple of obsolete uses including &quot;to<br/>\nbewail&quot; and &quot;to express compassion for&quot;) and Merriam-Webster has<br/>\n&quot;Express or feel sympathy or pity; sympathize.&quot;.  Sympathy perhaps does<br/>\nsuggest a wrong or hurt to be sympathised with; perhaps I am looking<br/>\nmore for a word which suggests empathising with, but I can&#39;t think of<br/>\none right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor me (UK English speaker), &#39;martyr&#39; definitely has negative<br/>\nconnotations. Actually, someone in this discussion suggested that their<br/>\nUK-English dictionary & their American-English dictionary had slightly<br/>\ndifferent definitions. The OED has a bunch of definitions associated<br/>\nwith undergoing death or sufferng for a faith/belief/cause; but also a<br/>\n&#39;hyperbolic or humorous&#39; usage:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; 4. Hyperbolically or humorously.<br/>\n <br/>\n a. A person who suffers, or behaves as if suffering, acute or extended<br/>\npain, unhappiness, emotional torment, etc.; a constant sufferer (to an<br/>\nailment, etc.). Also in extended use.<br/>\n<br/>\n b. to make a martyr of : to subject to hardship or inconvenience; to<br/>\nsacrifice (someone) in a cause; to make a martyr of oneself : to make a<br/>\nreal or pretended sacrifice of one&#39;s inclinations in order to gain<br/>\ncredit.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think when thinking about the &quot;mum as martyr&quot; idea, it&#39;s this last<br/>\nnotion of &quot;sacrificing to gain credit&quot; that is in my head. The sacrifice<br/>\nmay be real rather than pretended, but it doesn&#39;t always seem to be<br/>\n*necessary*. (Or the way they think about it isn&#39;t necessary.) Credit<br/>\nwith whom? Probably not their kids. (And dads don&#39;t seem to be described<br/>\nas &#39;martyrs&#39; or to use that notion of themselves, either, very often.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJuliet</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;.a martyr&quot;","postDate":"1356204493","msgId":69918,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkzNTBBMTZBLUVBMkQtNEZBQi1BM0FGLTYwOUM2NzUzNzk1NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwOEQyNTlDLUI1QkQtNDJEMS04OEYwLTI5MUZGODE0QkFGOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQwOEQyNTlDLUI1QkQtNDJEMS04OEYwLTI5MUZGODE0QkFGOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69917,"nextInTopic":69922,"prevInTime":69917,"nextInTime":69919,"topicId":69873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Hope this is of use to your dialogue, Sandra.

So not only to people seem to talk about their self-sacrificing parenting choices in order to impress each other, it is also viewed as a way of being humble, and if you don&#39;t join in, you&#39;re full of yourself. It&#39;s an interesting angle. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Keith and I went to a potluck dinner with mostly childless couples.  I think maybe all childless couples, though one of the dads has two boys grown, from an earlier marriage (I knew them and their mom, too, 25 years ago).   We didn&#39;t talk about our kids much.  When I mentioned that Holly had turned 21, our host (whom I&#39;ve known for over 30 years) asked &quot;Did you change the locks?&quot;  I said no, and looked disapprovingly at him, and he said oh, right; Martin&#39;s still home too, huh... and he said (a story I had never heard before) that for high school graduation his mother gave him luggage, and within a year she had put the drawers from his dresser, with the clothes in them, out in the front yard.    He ended up going across the country for college, and being drafted to Viet Nam.     That&#39;s another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people there were almost all from the Society for Creative Anachronism, and some of the conversation was about that (though much was about birds of prey, and rendering lard, and cooking, and post-and-beam construction, wild animal sightings in the southern Manzanos....  GOOD stuff).   Only once was I briefly draw into a conversation about the SCA, and it was bout how terrible the current newsletter editor is and how crappy the local webpage is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was involved in the club from 1976 to a few years ago.  I know a LOT about newsletter production and the needs of our local group.  I have some resentments woven in with what I know.  I was stirred, a bit, before I extricated myself and went to eat grapes and talk about the wooden candle-driven nativity machine (what are those called?? we didn&#39;t know).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning Keith and I talked about how interested he still is in the doings of the group (Marty is very active too), and how irritable I can get so easily when people press me to respond. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I told Keith was that it was like the kids at school who used to give me a flood of criticism about getting good grades, being nice to new kids, helping teachers, being friendly with the people in the office, the administrators, the counselor, about helping after school, about finishing my homework all the time...   rag, rag, rag about how I shouldn&#39;t be that way, and that I was making the rest of them look bad, and I didn&#39;t &quot;HAVE&quot; to do those things and that i was stupid to do those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone a year or so ago went off on me about my unschooling writing/speaking, and said &quot;we&quot; (speaking of her and her friends, or of her and all unschoolers the world over, or her and her tapeworms, not sure) had hoped that when my kids were grown I would stop and let other people do it, but no, I was still around (making her miserable, or her and her friends, or her and all unschoolers the world over).  The message was that I didn&#39;t have to, should NOT, was being stupid, and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in a group where there is a stated purpose about medieval studies and re-creations, when I mentioned that a song from the 15th century was better than a song from the 18th century, people would whine and complain and say I was too picky and uptight.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just that I was unwilling to invest that much of my time and knowledge and energy in people who didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about the difference between the 1700s and the 1500&#39;s.   And for some of you, that will make perfect sense (not to care, I mean, because old is old).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with parenting, if we will stoop and aim for average or below average, we will be doing a kindness to those who don&#39;t even aspire to do their best, who do not intend to sacrifice the least little BIT, who believe &quot;compromise&quot; means everyone else giving them their way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI get tired of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd being a good parent is not martyrdom.  It&#39;s this:  Being (in essence, in life, in thought, in action) a good (not bad, not average, but quality/careful/positive) parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":530860768,"authorName":"Amanda Peck","from":"Amanda Peck &lt;ama.cherie@...&gt;","profile":"pumkin_rabbit_foot","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;.a martyr&quot;","postDate":"1356196918","msgId":69916,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwOEQyNTlDLUI1QkQtNDJEMS04OEYwLTI5MUZGODE0QkFGOUBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69912,"nextInTopic":69917,"prevInTime":69915,"nextInTime":69917,"topicId":69873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, I find this thread very thought-provoking.

I have thought a lot about this in the last year that I&#39;ve been a mom (our son is almost a year already!), and your thread gives me the opportunity to coalesce all my thoughts into a cohesive statement (okay it might be more rambling than cohesive, but bear with me).<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, when I was growing up, I had a mother who reminded me frequently of how much she was self-sacrificing for me and my brother. I don&#39;t specifically remember her using the term &quot;martyr,&quot; but I also remember always associating this word with her in a negative context even as a child, as in &quot;mom thinks she&#39;s such a martyr.&quot; I remember that I picked up the term from a very oppressive Sunday School that I absolutely hated going to, as the prevailing tone was that kids were evil and bad and I must learn how to be better from the &quot;good&quot; teachers. Martyrdom was taught as a good term to describe saints, and yet I still always associate a negative context with it for some reason. I don&#39;t quite know what exactly caused me to take this view at such an early age, but I&#39;m sure it was a combination of things. I didn&#39;t exactly &quot;learn&quot; a lot about being good from the Sunday School teachers, so I instead built up negative feelings surrounding any of the &quot;lessons&quot; they scolded into me. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo go back to my mother, she formed a habit of describing how much all the things she did for me were a sacrifice on her part. If she cooked a good dinner that took longer than usual, she would remind us all throughout dinner how she got nothing else done that day, she had spent so much money on the meal, she was dead tired from slaving away in the kitchen all day, and finally she would ask everyone with baited expectation in her voice, &quot;now does everyone appreciate the meal I spent so much of my precious time and energy on?&quot; This tirade would inevitably cause the dinner, or gift, or anything else to lose its flavor or sparkle. I would end up feeling guilty that I didn&#39;t appreciate all the things she did for me, but I couldn&#39;t ever really feel joy about the gifts or good food if I was constantly told &quot;you never appreciate the sacrifices I make for you.&quot; So it was self-fulfilling terminology that my mother used to tell me that I wasn&#39;t appreciative, after which I would end up feeling guilty and like I was &quot;bad,&quot; and my mother would feel justified that she was right all along, yet she would feel down because she still thought all her efforts were self-sacrificing and unappreciated. It was a vicious cycle. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince putting a few hundred miles between us, I must say I was able to slowly pull myself out of the centrifugal force of that vicious cycle of martyrdom and guilt with my mother. However, after having a son of my own, these thoughts have resurfaced, and I have started to really confront them. I have thought that of course I wouldn&#39;t fall into the same pattern my mother had, but I&#39;m still running into deeply-ingrained thought processes that I think stem from language choices. For instance, the statements one of the other posters mentioned that are all-too-common in mothering circles today: &quot;I never get a second to myself,&quot; &quot;All I do is wipe butts and feed babies,&quot; &quot;I never get to have &#39;me-time.&#39;&quot; All those thoughts (I wouldn&#39;t say these are things I said out loud as much as caught myself thinking) really stifled any feelings of kindness and openness, and I could tell that once I started with one thought about my &quot;self-sacrificing,&quot; I would get stuck in a vicious cycle of negativity and self-fulfilling drudgery! Everything feels harder when I am in a negative frame of mind, and I get stuck focusing on what I wasn&#39;t getting or what I &quot;had&quot; to do. (I have read your page on &quot;have to&quot; and breaking away from that constricting way of thinking, Sandra, which is very helpful.) Once I realized that I was viewing myself as a &quot;martyr,&quot; or my concept of a martyr in the context of my self-bemoaning &quot;self-sacrificing&quot; mother, and snapped myself out of it, it was amazing how much my load lifted and both me, my son, and my husband all get in better moods. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I should mention is when I get around other conventional parents of the same age, who speak mainly in the terms Colleen was talking about: &quot;my kids are my world,&quot; and &quot;relaxing, what&#39;s that?&quot; etc., there is an expectation of contributing to this same dialogue. Those blanket martyr-like statements turn into statements pointed at myself and my son, or even direct questions like &quot;do you get any time to yourself if you&#39;re always carrying and sleeping with him?&quot; The statements or questions are always phrased in a way that the only acceptable answer seems to be a martyr-like complaint that we can moan over together! When I say something positive or disarming like &quot;I enjoy it, and he&#39;ll be running around in no time,&quot; it ends up shutting down the conversation, like I&#39;m someone who the other mom wanted to share a juicy tidbit of gossip with me and I had said something very condescending about how I do not gossip, thank you. I end up feeling like the other moms view me as condescending and better-than-thou because I don&#39;t complain about how horrible my life is and how I don&#39;t get a second to myself now that I&#39;m a mom.

So not only to people seem to talk about their self-sacrificing parenting choices in order to impress each other, it is also viewed as a way of being humble, and if you don&#39;t join in, you&#39;re full of yourself. It&#39;s an interesting angle. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last year I have realized the importance of surrounding myself with like-minded and positive parents, and not letting those negative-thinking parents get me down! It is easy to fall into that trap, even without other people to bring you down. It&#39;s so pervasive in our culture, to think once you have a child, &quot;you&#39;ll never have time to yourself or enough sleep for the next 18 years!&quot; I got very tired of people (even strangers) telling me when I was nearing the end of my pregnancy, &quot;sleep now, you won&#39;t be getting any of that soon!&quot; I think all these off-handed remarks add up to a very difficult cycle of thought to break free of. Our language certainly forms our thoughts, and I wish more people would challenge negative parenting cliches more as you do, Sandra, and all others on this wonderful list. If we stop the martyr-like mothering statements to each other and to ourselves, it opens up the possibility for change and the freedom to enjoy our new lives and partnerships with our children. Our relationships with our children can be on an equal level instead of always self-sacrificing and guilt-inducing as is the norm. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is of use to your dialogue, Sandra.

To some people it&#39;s so important that people on the outside &#39;see&#39; how incredibly caring and self-sacrificing they are, that it&#39;s not important at all whether they are actually caring or even act so. I remember so many times as a child feeling utterly humiliated as my mother told family/friends/strangers in front of me of her latest selfless act that had put my needs over hers, that was never actually true; it was either a complete fabrication or was something designed not to meet my wants/needs but to look self-sacrificing. My friends would always say to me, &quot;Your mum is sooo nice!&quot;, and she loved that, but it was what she showed them: this veneer of self sacrifice for what her children wanted, that wasn&#39;t real. When we left home, my grandmother moved in, and was used in the same way that we had been. This facet of how she wants people to see her is so important to her that she will actively avoid things that would make situations easier for her, because then it would limit the opportunities for martyrdom. If it can seem that the self-sacrifice has made her ill, even better.<br/>\nBut people who don&#39;t know her always tell her how lovely she is for the things she &#39;does&#39;, and that makes her happy.<br/>\nSo to me, the overriding sense of the word martyr is the way a person manipulates emotion through the illusion of self sacrifice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":229401449,"authorName":"kshamasati","from":"&quot;kshamasati&quot; &lt;kshamasati@...&gt;","profile":"kshamasati","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: &quot;a martyr&quot;","postDate":"1356126212","msgId":69901,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtiMmw2NCt1bGhmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENCNUI4NTE5LTNFRjktNDQ1RS1CMUJDLTUzOEU0MzA1RTIxRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69890,"nextInTopic":69904,"prevInTime":69900,"nextInTime":69902,"topicId":69873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am not a first language English speaker & the first thing that came to my mind when I read Sandra s exploration of the word martyr was WAR .

In the context of war, a martyr would be a person who lays down his own life &quot;selflessly&quot; to be able to save the lives of many others like a soldier.. Or maybe someone who might end the lives of others (selfless???)& themselves in the process of holding up an ideal or a vision of what *they* think is ideal, like a terrorist. Either way, When the person chooses to be a soldier or terrorist, he/she signs up to be a martyr too....<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow it is difficult to reconcile the image of war & death with a loving parent-child relationship!<br/>\n<br/>\n Within the context of a mother-child relationship how would the word martyr fit? is this martyr-mom sacrificing herself &quot;selflessly&quot; so that her child may live better? Does that make sense? Does it not imply automatically when you have a child that you do your best to give them the life that is the best you can think of? Do you become a martyr for doing it? If Terrorists could also be martyrs, then shouldn&#39;t we call the mom who sacrifices her own happiness & that of her child, to the ideal of the &quot;perfect&quot; mom a martyr? So what is then the point in becoming a martyr? <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the difference is that in war & terrorism, you are really not around to enjoy being the martyr. But in motherhood, a martyr-mom is sympathized and empathized with. She receives appreciation for being a martyr and is around to soak it all up. In the end, sympathy & appreciation from others becomes the actual motivator to be the &quot;martyr&quot; rather than the life of the child or their happiness!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a &quot;martyr&quot; also seems to be closely associated with being selfless....I wonder what it really means to be selfish or selfless....<br/>\n<br/>\nKshama.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;.a martyr&quot;","postDate":"1356118121","msgId":69890,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQzNkU1RjZDLTRENzgtNDE1NC1BRkUzLURGODBCNTExMjc5REBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAzZDkwMWNkZGY5MyQwNTY1M2RjMCQxMDJmYjk0MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+","referencesHeader":"PENCNUI4NTE5LTNFRjktNDQ1RS1CMUJDLTUzOEU0MzA1RTIxRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDAzZDkwMWNkZGY5MyQwNTY1M2RjMCQxMDJmYjk0MCRAY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":69889,"nextInTopic":69901,"prevInTime":69889,"nextInTime":69891,"topicId":69873,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- The kids watch their mothers suffer (and complain) supposedly in an attempt to please and serve them, when in reality the kids don t seem to feel pleased","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-997552371\">-=- The kids watch their mothers<br/>\nsuffer (and complain) supposedly in an attempt to please and serve them,<br/>\nwhen in reality the kids don&#39;t seem to feel pleased or served at all :-)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI hadn&#39;t even thought of that.

Suffering is passive. The idea that suffering is noble encourages people to put up with bad situations rather than work to change them. Putting up with pain as you work to make something better is good. Putting up with pain so someone else doesn&#39;t suffer shouldn&#39;t be a first choice.
