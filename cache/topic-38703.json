Unschooling, no matter how natural  <br/>\nor not it is to you, is a constant leap of faith. It always comes  <br/>\nback to whether or not you’re going to trust yourself, your children,  <br/>\nand your family as a whole, to hold hands and jump. Unschooling is  <br/>\nabout constantly adapting to the understanding that although the  <br/>\nobvious, easy, mainstream answer is to say no, you&#39;re going to learn  <br/>\nto say yes, to say yes to deciding to trust your children’s ability  <br/>\nto decide on their own what they need, and when they need it, and how  <br/>\nthey are going to get it. The ability to let go of a well-trained  <br/>\nreaction to just say no doesn&#39;t come easy. You can jump of the first  <br/>\ncliff, but it&#39;s parenthood, and there&#39;re going to be ten dozen more  <br/>\neven scarier jumps than your first. If unschooling were a tree  <br/>\ndivided into parts trust would be the trunk. It holds everything  <br/>\nelse, all of your other ideals and wants and opinions of unschooling,  <br/>\nup. It is sturdy and un-swaying and most of all necessary. After all,  <br/>\nwithout a trunk there is no tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn Holt said, &quot;To trust children we must first learn to trust  <br/>\nourselves...and most of us were taught as children that we could not  <br/>\nbe trusted.&quot; You need to start reversing this curse; trust yourself  <br/>\nand show your children that they can be trusted!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might have noticed by now that unschooling is not the easy way  <br/>\nout. It just Can Not truly be done halfway or with except-fors like  <br/>\nmath or bedtimes or diet. I have many sane, nice friends who I call  <br/>\n&quot;except-fors&quot;. The big difference between my family as unschoolers,  <br/>\nand their family as &quot;unschoolers except for&quot;, is that none of them  <br/>\nhave anything like the relationship I have with my parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could express to you how much I want these parents to  <br/>\nrealize that they could all change that one small thing, that whole  <br/>\ntrusting thing, and there would be communication between these people  <br/>\nwho feel they are from and in different worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI think people who have asked recently what they can do to influence  <br/>\nrelatives who don&#39;t understand might find some great quotes from  <br/>\nthat, or might could print it out and pass it on.   I&#39;ll put it here,  <br/>\ntoo, for ease of printing out.<br/>\nhttp://sandradodd.com/teens/dagny<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a link to Rue&#39;s book on parenting, too, which would help  <br/>\nanyone here who&#39;s having any kind of difficulties understanding why  <br/>\nit would help to give children more freedom and how it would work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing.  At Rue&#39;s blog, which you should get to with the  <br/>\nlinks above, but if not here:<br/>\nhttp://another-roadside-attraction.blogspot.com/<br/>\nhas links to the boingboing discussion of John Holt, in case any of  <br/>\nyou  missed that.  There are comments now, and I personally fear to  <br/>\ngo.  I have too much on my list of things I&#39;ve forgotten to do lately  <br/>\nto get involved in that today, but some of you might have some time  <br/>\nand energy to spare.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38680,"nextTopicId":38705}}
