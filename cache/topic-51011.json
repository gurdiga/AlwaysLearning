There  <br/>\nare people who don&#39;t come to the chats because they don&#39;t type fast  <br/>\nenough to keep up.  I understand that.  If there was a weekly  <br/>\nunschooling water polo get-together I would not be there at all,  <br/>\nbecause I don&#39;t know which is worse--water?  or balls coming toward my  <br/>\nhead.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a project LOTS of people will see for years, though, photos of  <br/>\nunschooled kids are needed:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unschooling.info/photosneeded\">http://unschooling.info/photosneeded</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a link and some details.  News this morning is this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Any pictures are okay - doing stuff or close-ups - all fine...&quot;  and  <br/>\nit&#39;s okay for there to be more than one of each child.  Send as many  <br/>\nas you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re current.  I sent some from when the kids  <br/>\nwere little.  All that matters is that they&#39;re not stock photos, but  <br/>\nare real images of actual unschoolers.  It&#39;s for Unschooling: the  <br/>\nMovie, Lee Stranahan&#39;s project.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those who want to come to the chat, there&#39;s one later today.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular\">http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular</a><br/>\nand another one on Friday, for which I&#39;ll be in Fort Collins,  <br/>\nColorado, at Jill Parmer&#39;s house.  I&#39;ll look just the same in the  <br/>\nchat, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50959,"nextTopicId":51012}}
