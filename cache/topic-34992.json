During the event we were in the bleachers waiting for the main battle to start.  They came around selling drinks.  We asked for 3 Cokes but they only had two, so I said I&#39;d take a bottle of water. Later Zachariah got up and left.  We thought he&#39;d gone to the bathroom. He came back with another Coke and handed it to me.  He had wanted to get a new pocket knife he&#39;d seen in one of the seller&#39;s tents and had exactly enough money to purchase it - but he chose to spontaneously get me a Coke instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trust is there that we will get him what we can with joy and he returned that trust and faith by providing for me with joy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34995,"nextTopicId":34903}}
