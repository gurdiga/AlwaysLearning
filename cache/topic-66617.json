There&#39;s a difference between saying a statement is true/not true and saying it is interesting/not interesting.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t passed on by individual statements, though, but by sets of experiences, and  by ideas polished by discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s possible for someone to come to this discussion and say something very cool that nobody&#39;s ever thought before.  When it happens, they get praise and &quot;good idea!&quot;  And sometimes THAT validates the idea.   Sometimes others quote it, or it goes on a webpage, and that adds some validity (or accessibility and fans).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we&#39;re not in a test situation where answers are given by one person for the purpose of competition, the ideas go into a swirl and are used as a set.  Some people come and leave because their ideas were questioned or dismantled a bit.  They don&#39;t like that, and the leave.  But it&#39;s the examination of the ideas that sifts and sorts and leaves the best of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few statements from years ago that I WISH I had saved names for.  We had no idea there would be discussions and blogs and webpages fifteen years later and we would want citations.  But since then I&#39;ve kept names with quotes to prevent the snagging and claiming of quotes by people who didn&#39;t originate them.  (Most notably that happened with &quot;...like throwing marshmallows at their heads and calling it eating.&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past few years, I&#39;ve started adding dates and sometimes a link.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, for the purpose of what I do, it matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-The circumstances don&#39;t negate the validity of the statement but of course they can make it more interesting. There&#39;s a difference between saying a statement is true/not true and saying it is interesting/not interesting.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they don&#39;t negate the veracity of the statement.  Someone with a four year old daughter could be telling the god&#39;s-honest truth that her daughter did indeed state that when she grows up, she will unschool her child.  A four year old wouldn&#39;t say that, though.  And a four year old might end up in school at the age of five.  So the *validity* of the statement in a discussion such as this one is insignificant.  <br/>\n<br/>\nValid has value.  <br/>\nLots of things have value.  <br/>\nIt depends what use it&#39;s to be put to, though, whether it&#39;s sufficiently valuable within a context, and the purpose of this discussion is to deal in these issues:<br/>\n<br/>\n*******<br/>\nHow and why does unschooling work? What kind of parents and parenting does it take? What will help, and what will hinder? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling and attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based on the principles underlying unschooling.<br/>\n*******<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it helps to know whether the words are coming from someone who is living a life based on the principles of unschooling, and has examined that life. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it&#39;s okay that some people&#39;s writing is more valuable than others, and it can&#39;t be helped.  It&#39;s the way life is.  Some people write quickly and clearly.  Some write clearly but it takes a while.  Some don&#39;t write as well, but they have great ideas.  People have their favorite other authors, too, after a while.  It&#39;s normal and natural.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone came and refused to say whether she had kids or not, and said &quot;You should read my posts, though, because my ideas might be the best you&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t want to read her posts.  I only have so much time, and if someone&#39;s going to be irritating, it&#39;s not good for the peace and prosperity of this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat condition isn&#39;t true of the blogger about which this all started, though.  She&#39;s real and does say who her kids are; she&#39;s just obscuring personal details.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I bring a post anonymously.  When I do that, it&#39;s anonymous for the purposes of the list, and it gains validity because people trust that I know who wrote it and that it&#39;s being brought in that fashion for some good reason.  (And those are usually questions, not so much advice, though a time or two  there was a professional opinion brought that way  from a professional who didn&#39;t want to be on the record.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":464212763,"authorName":"Miliana Johnson","from":"&quot;Miliana Johnson&quot; &lt;milianajohnson@...&gt;","profile":"milianajohnson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Considerations about anonymity and &quot;screen names&quot;","postDate":"1334094072","msgId":66661,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGptMjlkbysxMGNvMkBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNWkp0R1V5Z1lTNnY1aDRENFM4QldmdzVacXN2LVRuSERxQ2FFK19ITjZTZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66660,"nextInTopic":66663,"prevInTime":66660,"nextInTime":66662,"topicId":66617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

A friend who has come several times to my home and knows me for years.<br/>\nShe can ask if my home is nice, peaceful or not. If my kids and I get along and much much more.<br/>\nSo it is bound to come out in the open who I am.<br/>\nI am far from being this great unschooling mom. I struggle. I try, I am getting better. I have my moments like today when <br/>\nI am sick again.<br/>\nBut if you know me you know I am the person I say I am.<br/>\nSchuyler also has been to my home. I have learned so much more since the last time she was here. I think I am better. I hope I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Schuyler writes I can totally trust what she writes because I have met her and I know her and her family. <br/>\nAnd they are even more wonderful than what they seem on posts.<br/>\nThey really are that awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend, a close friend in my town, that has met Sandra when she was here in Minnesota 5 years ago and unfortunately I did not get to see her.<br/>\nShe told me the same thing Schuyler told me. That watching Sandra with her children, ( with Holly here in MN) was amazing.<br/>\nThe amount of attention and connection she has with them. How she related to them was inspiring . My friend said she was<br/>\njust in awe and learned to much by just spending a few hours with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n So yes, going to a Conference and getting to meet people and watch them was /is fabulous.

I don&#39;t think of it in terms of fair or unfair -- I would be just as comfortable sharing the info without any sort of acknowledgement. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I wouldn&#39;t want someone taking my words and attaching their own name to them, so having my name (or screen name) attached is helpful in that respect. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll admit it was neat when you quoted something by me on Just Add Light & Stir, because it was something I didn&#39;t recall writing and I was impressed, now, by what I was able to articulate back then. I don&#39;t know that I would&#39;ve recognized myself as the writer if you hadn&#39;t identified me, but I still would&#39;ve enjoyed the writing regardless -- and I&#39;m happy for that quote to be shared regardless of whether it&#39;s credited to me or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===Any thoughts about me quoting it without the name?===<br/>\n<br/>\nI read a lot of things on your site and I don&#39;t often look to see who wrote them. But when I read your site I feel that you&#39;ve already vetted the content and that what I read there will fall in line with my own views of unschooling and parenting. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this particular example (of the blog post re: Minecraft), I don&#39;t find the information any less valuable or thought-provoking because of not having the author&#39;s name attached. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, because of the age of my child and the number of years we&#39;ve been unschooling, I&#39;m pretty comfortable reading something described as &quot;unschooling&quot; and determining if it&#39;s radical unschooling in the way discussed on this list. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were new to unschooling, it definitely helped having names attached to writings because it helped me figure out whose writing I wanted to read more of, which ties into your question about when and why it might be important to know people&#39;s names. That said, it wouldn&#39;t matter to me if it was that person&#39;s real name or a screen name, as long as it was what they consistently used in their writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Considerations about anonymity and &quot;screen names&quot;","postDate":"1333943238","msgId":66622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzM5NDMyMzguNTkxNjMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEIyNTAxMDBELUI0NjEtNDIwNC1BMUFDLUU3QzBERDJDMTY0NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEIyNTAxMDBELUI0NjEtNDIwNC1BMUFDLUU3QzBERDJDMTY0NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66621,"nextInTopic":66623,"prevInTime":66621,"nextInTime":66623,"topicId":66617,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sure Some people may say things that make sense and are great even if they themselves do not truly understand or even embrace them.
