(We were in the<br/>\nconstant question phase, and I couldn&#39;t understand the questions - very<br/>\nfrustrating for us both.)  The therapist wanted me to send him in alone.  I<br/>\ntold her that he could go alone if he wanted (I knew he wouldn&#39;t) but that<br/>\nshe could count on him not saying a word to them if he did.  He was very<br/>\nuncomfortable speaking with strangers (even people I knew) for years<br/>\n*except* in a sports situation.  The first time I took him to a sports group<br/>\n(age 5), he boogied right off to play.  I was surprised and mentioned it to<br/>\ndh, who said he was exactly the same as a kid, shy except for sports.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nHe gradually became more comfortable, but he still wouldn&#39;t call anyone on<br/>\nthe phone.  Even when friends called him, he&#39;d get on his bike and go over<br/>\nto their house rather than return the call.  Now he&#39;ll call friends, but not<br/>\nbusinesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy granddaughter will talk to anyone, and has for a long time.  She gets on<br/>\nthe phone to call and invite people she barely knows to performances she&#39;s<br/>\ngoing to be in, that kind of thing.  The other day, she insisted on going<br/>\ninto the bank *by herself* to do her banking.  She&#39;s 8.  Lars is 15 and<br/>\nstill wants me to come in with him, though I no longer have to go right up<br/>\nto the teller with him.  I think he&#39;s more concerned about filling out the<br/>\nslips correctly.  Kids vary so much.<br/>\nTia<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary<br/>\nsaftety deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;  Ben Franklin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13523,"nextTopicId":13514}}
