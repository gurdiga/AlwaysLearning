My niece has been very damaged by school and by the relationship issues that have ensued as a result of that damage with her mum, dad and step-dad. My sister has asked my advice and I have suggested helping my niece to do plenty of what she loves, at least for the first few weeks, and to focus on healing their relationship - building trust and connection.<br><br>I asked her what my niece loves doing the most at the moment, and she said &#39;music and drama&#39;.<br><br>So I wondered if anyone had any links and/or we could have a discussion of how music and drama can benefit someone&#39;s life and learning - a bit like Sandra&#39;s page of &#39;what can you learn from video games&#39;.
