What a great email for her to send to you.  That is such a great feeling when others can see the value and assets in our children that we see as their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Recently, the boys and I went with my parents up to Monterey Bay, CA. to scatter my grandmother&#39;s ashes.  While all the &quot;grown-ups&quot; were planning and visiting at my uncle&#39;s house, the boys and I were outside playing and exploring the small fish pond.  When the neighbor noticed my boys (at a house that has no children) she came over and invited them to play with her kids in their yard.  A couple of days after returning home my uncle&#39;s wife emailed me to tell me that the neighbor had come over and  complimented my boys on their thoughtfulness and politeness.  But what really made me proud was when she said, &quot;And they are so creative in their play!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Yay for unschooling and seeing the value of play!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Jen  :o)<br/>\n  Mom to Beck (8) and Dane (5)<br/>\n  Learning the natural way every day!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve already received this e-mail:<br/>\n<br/>\n  --------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  you all are AWESOME parents. your children are SO different from same aged <br/>\n  kids i encounter because you have allowed them to be PEOPLE.<br/>\n<br/>\n  i am very proud of your kids if that makes any sense to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n  i really meant it about taping, i&#39;ll be glad to do it. i did a soccer game <br/>\n  for katrina once, it came out pretty darned good.<br/>\n<br/>\n  ----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n  She&#39;s comparing them not only to the kids she teaches, but her granddaughters <br/>\n  and their friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Feels pretty good!!<br/>\n<br/>\n  Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n  Yahoo!

By our teens, we had virtually nothing in common, and rarely chose to spend time together.  I&#39;ve so enjoyed watching Andy & Dan become close, knowing that if Andy were in school, he&#39;d be much too &#39;big&#39; for his little brother.
