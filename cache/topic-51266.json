I was terrible at math.  I developed such a fear of it and the teachers that walking into class could make me feel sick.  I was clueless and confused and everything went too fast for me.  By the time I was finished with high school my inability to do math was such a part of my identity that I avoided whole career choices because of it.  I had &#39;anti&#39; math.  I eventually went back to school as an adult for a programming degree because I had experience with computers and coding and wanted the degree (I&#39;m 42 now, that degree is not as important as it was then).   There were math requirements, and I had to start at the very beginning (no credit remedial courses).  It was slow for me, but I filled the requirements.   I absolutely believe when you are ready to learn something and need to, that is when its possible.  I still have math anxiety, my mind goes blank when I&#39;m put on the spot.  I do not consider myself good at the math in those classes I took because I have no retention.  They were more like hoops to jump through to get the degree than actually useful to what I do.  My sons (14 & 10) who have never had a math class approach math naturally and fearlessly, without anxiety and white outs.

Maybe if they were first exposed to it in real life instead of in a math book, or maybe if they were older, or maybe if one of the moms wasn&#39;t standing over her daughter saying, &quot;OK, he gave you $5 and the box of cookies costs $3.50, so how much change does he get?&quot; or maybe if people who were buying cookies didn&#39;t keep saying, &quot;This is good math practice for you&quot;, they could have relaxed and figured it out.

Last Sunday we were selling girl scout cookies at Shop&#39;n&#39;Save with some other third grade brownies and moms.  When we arrived for our shift, one of the moms told me that the girls had struggled a little bit with making change.  So I stayed close by to help any of the girls in our group who might need it.  They all did.  The thing is, I know that each of these girls were &quot;taught&quot; (with lessons and homework) how to make change by counting up in math class earlier in the year.  And none of them could do it.  As a new unschooler, it&#39;s reassuring to know that I&#39;m not depriving my daughter of good learning opportunities by keeping her out of school.  But it was also sad and frustrating for me to see girls looking nervous and a little embarrassed that they couldn&#39;t make change.  In this case, all the school managed to teach them was math anxiety.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth C.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51340,"nextTopicId":51146}}
