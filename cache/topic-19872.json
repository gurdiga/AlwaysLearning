L (5) however, will not let A (2) into the den.   I try and say it&#39;s a sharing toy and that A must be allowed in too but L insists he is not allowed in and screams and screams and barricades the door with all his might  In the meantime A gets really upset and starts crying and screaming and bashing the den with toy guns and swords and has broken all 3 windows on it like this.  Its come to the point were I dread going in the garden and I usually sit in front of the shed door so no-one can get in  L is quite happy with this because it means A isn&#39;t in there but it still causes trouble cos A still wants to go in but is easier to handle if L isn&#39;t going in there either.  I wonder whether to just board it up for now till they get to a point were they can share it  it gets so stressful!!<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tA has a car, one that the kid can sit in and move with his feet.  It is his toy.  L likes playing in it too and sometimes A objects to L playing with it especially if he wants to play in it himself.  Now, when A has a toy of L&#39;s and L wants it back then we get A to give it back to L, even if A is upset about it cos if we don&#39;t L will start screaming and hurting A. <br/>\n<br/>\n However, when the shoe is on the other foot and A wants his car back it feels like this same logic should apply  it&#39;s A&#39;s toy and  he wants it back.  We say the same thing to L about it being A&#39;s toy and him wanting it back (like we do when it&#39;s the other way round) and you can see the confusion and upset on A&#39;s face when L doesn&#39;t give  his toy back and a battle ensues to get A his toy back. <br/>\n<br/>\n I could wrestle A off to another room kicking and screaming and attacking me and calm him down eventually with some other distraction but I wouldn&#39;t be doing this because A&#39;s need was less or because he was neccessarily more pacifiable, but, because he is younger he can, at present, `be&#39; wrestled away and because his screams and physical attacks are less painful than that of L&#39;s  and easier for me to deal with because he is physically smaller and weaker than L.  <br/>\n<br/>\n3.  This is a typical type of situation that happens a lot and it happened this morning.  L wants me to cuddle up and watch a film with him which I do while A is playing about with stuff i got out for him.  Then after a while A gets bored with having no attention and comes and takes my hand and tries to drag me up of the chair to come watch him play drums in the kitchen (which are in there so the noise doesn&#39;t disturb L tv watching).  L then clings onto me and wont let me leave.  A is getting distressed and I feel really stuck  L wont let me get up at all even to find some new toys for A to play with.  In the end I tell A no i am watching tv with lewis and he is still upset but sits on my knee and watches the film with us for a bit.  I feel really guilty and crap.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sharing","postDate":"1284232953","msgId":57243,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDOEJENkY5LjkwMkBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2Z2k3NCtob2o3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2Z2k3NCtob2o3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57240,"nextInTopic":57321,"prevInTime":57242,"nextInTime":57244,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

At best, you&#39;ll feel self righteous. That&#39;s not better or kinder, its a setup for a lot of garbage and unhappiness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve sooooo been there, with the kid who gets &quot;it all&quot; - the lion&#39;s share of the attention, the food, the conversation. Its not better to put his needs on the back burner, it only makes them bigger, setting him up to clamor more and lash out more. That isn&#39;t better for Anyone. Its hard to make the mental shift to &quot;more for this child is more fair&quot;. At first I needed to see it as a weighing of lesser evils - hard on one or hard on everyone? But over time that shifted to something much more positive... and hard to express. If you start out from &quot;life isn&#39;t fair&quot; that sounds hard-but-true. But there&#39;s a positive side to &quot;life isn&#39;t fair&quot; and its that there is abundance in the world. One of you kids has an abundance of feeling and expression and needs a lot of help dealing with that right now. You could squash him down, make him &quot;fair&quot; by telling him his feelings are unimportant and his expression is unwelcome, or you can change the  way you see Him - to see his emotionality and expressiveness as part of what makes him wonderful and whole and himself. Do you really want to take those things away from him? <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Yes, A can be pacified and distracted from his wants and yes L screams<br/>\n&gt; louder and is more determined to get his own way, but does this make it<br/>\n&gt; right for A to constantly have his needs/wants compromised based on what L<br/>\n&gt; wants?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Part of the problem is you are overlaying adult expectations onto children. At 2 years old, A isn&#39;t calming down because he&#39;s spent decades learning to squash and ignore his emotions, which is why an adult would react the way he is - he&#39;s calming or being distracted because his feelings and reactions aren&#39;t as big as his brother&#39;s. If he can be distracted, then whatever it was didn&#39;t matter very much. If he can be pacified, then his feelings weren&#39;t so vast. Its not fair to him to hold him up to the standard of his brother - he Doesn&#39;t feel things that strongly, and that&#39;s okay, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;does this make it<br/>\n&gt; right...?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Its so easy to get stuck on that question! What&#39;s kinder in the moment? For one child to be melting down, upsetting you and anyone else in the house, or the other child to be distracted into feeling okay? Its Okay to go for that kinder solution. It won&#39;t make the older child a bully and the younger a victim, it will allow them both the chance to learn about empathy and kindness - yes, even L. He can&#39;t learn about those things when he&#39;s melting down, its not possible. He can only learn them when he&#39;s been shown so much empathy and kindness that he has enough to offer to others. My giant-needs stepson is almost 17. Not only is he not a bully, he&#39;s very kind and thoughtful. He&#39;s human, not a paragon, when he&#39;s spent a big chunk of time around folks who talk down to teenagers, he tends to be louder and more domineering, but only verbally - as in he talks over the tops of other people and expresses himself in strong, loaded language. Most of the time, though, he&#39;s a warm, giving person, someone who likes to help others. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 16 for another couple weeks)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sharing","postDate":"1284221699","msgId":57234,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2QkQ2QTNBLUE5MjktNDE2NS1BOURELUYwNDRBQzdBRDQ0MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM4QjEwNkE4LjY0ODUla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4=","referencesHeader":"PEM4QjEwNkE4LjY0ODUla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":57233,"nextInTopic":57240,"prevInTime":57233,"nextInTime":57235,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I can see the sense in the advice I’ve been given here but I cant impliment it with a great amount of assurance or confidence. -=- I m going to start a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-629895114\">-=-I can see the sense in the advice I�ve been given<br/>\nhere but I cant impliment it with a great amount of assurance or  <br/>\nconfidence. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to start a new topic with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Sharing","postDate":"1284221627","msgId":57233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGNDI3OTc1LTM2REQtNEFCQy1BOTk1LUFBNTMwNDYyNDhBRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM4QjEwNkE4LjY0ODUla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4=","referencesHeader":"PEM4QjEwNkE4LjY0ODUla2F6emFyYXRAYmx1ZXlvbmRlci5jby51az4="},"prevInTopic":57228,"nextInTopic":57234,"prevInTime":57232,"nextInTime":57234,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Yes, A can be pacified and distracted from his wants and yes L screams louder and is more determined to get his own way, but does this make it right for A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2131423822\">-=-Yes, A can be pacified and distracted from his wants and yes L  <br/>\nscreams<br/>\nlouder and is more determined to get his own way, but does this make it<br/>\nright for A to constantly have his needs/wants compromised based on  <br/>\nwhat L<br/>\nwants?

But as soon as this situation surfaced, suddenly it wasn&#39;t about<br/>\nbeing fair (as in attention equally applied to each child.. they had 3<br/>\nby then and in two years they would have another child). It was about<br/>\nbeing suddenly aware of something I didn&#39;t know to make them aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true of emotional needs too. Situations change, some children<br/>\nacclimate better than others, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo. Not only is fair not measurable. It isn&#39;t something to be equally<br/>\ndealt out to each child. Some children have greater need for some<br/>\nthings than others. One day your youngest will very likely have a need<br/>\nin another area that would never be a concern for your first child.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing fair isn&#39;t possible especially if it&#39;s being looked at as &quot;fair<br/>\nmeans equal.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Sharing","postDate":"1283989259","msgId":57166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk2OTZ1YitiZXJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2N29zYytwMWQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57164,"nextInTopic":57167,"prevInTime":57165,"nextInTime":57167,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** It might help to see things from the older child s perspective - your 5yo has had his whole world taken over by a toddler.

Its easy to be a big brother to a baby, not so easy when the baby starts to run around playing with all the toys. To A, the toys are just there, but to L, they have a history. Beyond that, taking back a toy is something L can control, to some extent. Having a toddler in the house means there are a lot of things he can&#39;t control, though - he&#39;s having to share space and parents and time, too. That can be pretty stressful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Occassionally A does object to L playing with one of his toys and then world war 3 ensues as i try to get L to give back A his toy in the same way that he expects A to give back his toys when the roles are reversed.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>\n<br/>\nCan A be distracted at all?

If his needs are bigger and louder than those of the 2yos, then they are - life doesn&#39;t give everyone the same personalities and temperaments and needs. It is kind to both your kids to make sure those bigger needs are being met - it helps make for a more peaceful life for the 2yo as much as the older child. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re thinking &quot;this is so unfair&quot; every time you&#39;re giving the older child attention, you&#39;ll end up communicating some of that to him - and that will add fuel to his neediness and jealosy. The more you can give to him wholeheartedly, the better he&#39;ll feel about himself and his relationship with you - and ultimately with his brother, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sharing","postDate":"1283979535","msgId":57164,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBDRDRFQTgyLUQxMzgtNEVBRC1CMUNDLTdFN0ZCNjdENDg5QUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk2N29zYytwMWQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGk2N29zYytwMWQ1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57163,"nextInTopic":57166,"prevInTime":57163,"nextInTime":57165,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I think the unfairness of the toy thing kinda reflects a wider unfairness i feel between the boys too in that i always feel like we are doing everything to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-948672562\">-=-I think the unfairness of the toy thing kinda reflects a wider  <br/>\nunfairness i feel between the boys too in that i always feel like we  <br/>\nare doing everything to pander to L&#39;s wants and wishes and A has to  <br/>\nlargely just fit in.

Our house is overflowing with toys and because the eldest, L, has been around longer a higher proportion of the toys are his - also, due to available space, we have slowed down the toy buying over the last year anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nL is sparodic in his claims over &#39;his&#39; toys - some toys he always objects to A playing with, others he sometimes objects and sometimes doesnt and others he on the whole doesnt mind A playing with them but will occassionally get possesive about them.  Also to be honest we have that many toys that half the time i&#39;m not really sure who they were bought for in the first place so its hard to seperate it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nL wants all his toys to be his and to be able to snatch them out of  A&#39;s hands if he so wishes, however, he wants all A&#39;s toys to be sharing toys.  This seems really unfair to me but it often works out the way L wishes because A is not so possessive over his toys.  Occassionally A does object to L playing with one of his toys and then world war 3 ensues as i try to get L to give back A his toy in the same way that he expects A to give back his toys when the roles are reversed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find this recurring situation extremely stressful and the only thing new i can come up with is to go out and buy A a load of new toys that are JUST for him to play with and not L to kind of re-dress the balance.  Although this will cause upset for L that he cant play with new toys of A&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWe already try and keep L&#39;s more special toys out of A&#39;s way, although he often leaves them out right were A is playing and then goes mad when A picks them up.  I dont enforce sharing but try to gently encourage it as best i can - usually with little success!!  I&#39;m also very present with them all the time - unless someone is here to play with them other than me, the only things i do other than play with them is get food for us and the basics of personal hygiene!!!  So its really not the case that it is little boys left to squabble on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the unfairness of the toy thing kinda reflects a wider unfairness i feel between the boys too in that i always feel like we are doing everything to pander to L&#39;s wants and wishes and A has to largely just fit in.  L has huge jealousy issues with A and says things like &#39;he&#39;s not my brother - he;s a bad baby&#39;, he really does not like him.  To help with this we do all the usual stuff - one on one time with L, letting him express his negative feelings about A to us, not making him be &#39;the big boy&#39; etc and by generally doing whatever he wants even though it sometimes feels like A&#39;s wants and desires are being trampled on.  This happens because i&#39;m so scared of making his feelings toward A worse by insisting on what A wants too often - i do my best to do what they both want but if its completely incompatible L usual gets his way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts appreciated...<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":157270430,"authorName":"Barbara Chase","from":"Barbara Chase &lt;barb@...&gt;","profile":"bc_avn","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sharing","postDate":"1087356934","msgId":19876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PHAwNjAxMDIzNmJjZjU2ZDc1MWUyZUBbMjA0LjE4OS4xMS40MV0+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjE1MjAyMTI0LjU0NjM1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjE1MjAyMTI0LjU0NjM1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19874,"nextInTopic":57163,"prevInTime":19875,"nextInTime":19877,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I don t try to teach sharing.

I don&#39;t share everything of mine with<br/>\neveryone, so I don&#39;t expect my daughter to do so.  But, I am generous and I<br/>\nlive my life with my daughter this way - so she sees what it&#39;s like.  In<br/>\nthe past we would put the really special things away when others came over,<br/>\nbut sometimes there was something left out and my dd felt very strongly<br/>\nabout not sharing it.  When this came up we didn&#39;t force her to share it,<br/>\ninstead I would find a solution that would work for everyone and I would<br/>\nmake a mental note not to leave out that particular toy next time.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s now 5.5 and is generous - so it&#39;s not as much of an issue.  And we<br/>\ndon&#39;t usually need to put special things away anymore because her friends<br/>\nalso have special things they don&#39;t want to share, so it&#39;s OK not to share<br/>\nsome things -- with all but one friend, who seems bent on only playing with<br/>\nthe one special thing that might be out and visible.  I have a feeling that<br/>\nshe is forced to share in her house and isn&#39;t allowed to have anything<br/>\nspecial.  What my daughter and I have come up with for this issue is to<br/>\nhave something special for this friend when she comes over, something that<br/>\nwill be just hers.  I hope this will work for her, because she can really<br/>\ndig in her heals and refuse to compromise or play with anything else but<br/>\nthe special toy.  Another thing I have done with arguments over toys that<br/>\nare out and available to anyone is to be the one who holds the space of<br/>\nneutrality or calm while everyone finds a workable solution - sort of like<br/>\nSandra&#39;s farmer in her pocket while making lunch, or having a time-out for<br/>\nthe toy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nciao<br/>\n--bc--</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171005601,"authorName":"Jonell Alvi","from":"Jonell Alvi &lt;jnjalvi@...&gt;","profile":"jnjalvi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Sharing","postDate":"1087330884","msgId":19874,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDQwNjE1MjAyMTI0LjU0NjM1LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxODA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMGUwMWM0NTJmYiRmNzAzMTVlMCQzOTAxYThjMEBkYXduPg=="},"prevInTopic":19872,"nextInTopic":19876,"prevInTime":19873,"nextInTime":19875,"topicId":19872,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, When ds Ben (age 4) has a friend over and is having trouble sharing, or is fighting with his friend over a toy, I try to help them work it out.
