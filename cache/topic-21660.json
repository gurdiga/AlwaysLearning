He&#39;s almost 4 (on the 24th!) and our only <br/>\ntotally unschooled child, having done some school at home with Andy, <br/>\nso he&#39;s the true unschooling testimonial.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning, I used the word &#39;himself&#39; in a sentence.  Dan <br/>\ncorrected me, saying &quot;HISself, Mama.&quot;  I answered, &quot;No, it&#39;s <br/>\nhimself.&quot;  He asked, &quot;Why?&quot;  I thought about it for a moment, then I <br/>\nsaw what had happened.  He&#39;s already figured out that my and him are <br/>\ndifferent kinds of pronoun forms!  He was right, too.  If we say <br/>\nmyself (with my being a possessive pronoun) it should be hisself <br/>\n(with his as the possessive pronoun).  The same is true of <br/>\nthemselves/theirselves.  Likewise, if himself and themselves is the <br/>\npreferred usage, it should be meself, since him, them and me are all <br/>\nreflexive (or is it prepositional?) pronouns.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI explained to him that I could see what he meant, but that what we <br/>\nsay is himself, and I&#39;m not sure why, just that it is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve known for a while that he&#39;s the budding grammar nazi, but I am <br/>\nconstantly amazed by how much he learns just listening to us talk!  <br/>\nIt is so cool to watch unschooling work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21661,"nextTopicId":21663}}
