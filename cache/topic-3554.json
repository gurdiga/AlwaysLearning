(bacitracin is used as lubrication to <br/>\nmake it easier for the needle & jewlery to go through the skin.)<br/>\n<br/>\n- cleanliness of the piercer. to be a &quot;pro with a gun&quot;, the<br/>\n&quot;piercer&quot;<br/>\nmust only know how to load the gun & aim straight. this does not<br/>\naccount for cross-contamination from touching other objects with<br/>\nlatex gloves on, nor does it cover the occasional spray of blood<br/>\nfrom a previous piercee, from which the gun cannot be properly<br/>\ncleansed. professional piercers are trained in how to prevent<br/>\ncross-contamination & the transmission of blood-borne pathogens<br/>\n& you&#39;ll see them changing their gloves every time they touch<br/>\nsomething non-autoclaved. the APP (the association of professional<br/>\npiercers) watches over procedures & if you&#39;re being pierced by an<br/>\nAPP-approved shop, you know the piercer has been through<br/>\nthe classes that teach him these things. the &quot;piercers&quot; that work<br/>\nin the mall & use guns have no such organization.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the stud itself. the gun can only hold a butterfly-back stud, & if<br/>\nyou&#39;ve ever seen one, you know that they&#39;re difficult to clean<br/>\nproperly. dried lymph fluids (& sometimes, initially, blood) get<br/>\ncaught in this backing & make it easier to contract infection.<br/>\ninitial &#39;needle-pierce&#39; jewelry is generally a ring, which makes<br/>\ncleaning much easier due to there being nowhere for discharge,<br/>\nhair, dirt, & bacteria to get stuck. studs also have a tendency to<br/>\nbecome wrapped with hair, which can imbed the hair in the<br/>\npiercing.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. trauma to the ear:<br/>\n<br/>\n- as previously stated, the gun can only hold one type of stud, the<br/>\ndimensions of which happen to be 18ga, approximately 1/4&quot; in<br/>\nlength. this small gauge is generally inappropriate for any area<br/>\nof cartilage (upper ear, nostrils) for two reasons. one, it&#39;s<br/>\ntougher to heal a small hole than it is a large one. a dermal<br/>\npunched (like a big hole punch) 2ga ear cartilage piercing will<br/>\nheal months faster than a 18ga gun OR needle pierce in the same<br/>\narea of tissue, on the same person, due to the surface area<br/>\ninvolved. the second reason concerns the initial hole size.<br/>\ncartilage should be pierced with a step larger needle than jewelry<br/>\n(14ga needle with 16ga jewelry, et cetera), as this gives the<br/>\ncartilage some room to grow in around the piercing. i&#39;ve proven<br/>\nthis on myself - the only cartilage piercings i&#39;m still having<br/>\ntrouble with were pierced with either the same size needle as<br/>\njewlery or a gun.<br/>\n<br/>\n- when a gun piercing is performed, the end of the stud is what<br/>\ncreates<br/>\nthe hole. this is much more traumatic for the ear, as the stud<br/>\nisn&#39;t nearly sharp enough to avoid compacting the tissue, leading<br/>\nto a longer healing period. a needle is razor-sharp & carves a<br/>\ncresent-shaped hole in the ear which is stretched round as the<br/>\nrest of the needle continues through the newly made hole. less<br/>\ncompacted tissue leads to quicker healing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the length of the stud, 1/4&quot;, is too short to allow for swelling.<br/>\nthe<br/>\npierce needs to be given room to swell so as to prevent pain &<br/>\npossible imbedding of the stud in the ear. rings used as initial<br/>\njewelry, which cannot be installed with a gun piercing, when sized<br/>\nproperly, give plenty of room to swell. rings are chosen based on<br/>\nthe size of the person&#39;s ear to be pierced (standard is 3/8&quot; to<br/>\n5/8&quot; in diameter). this cannot be done with a gun.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. pain:<br/>\n<br/>\n- a quick push with a razor-sharp needle is less painful than an<br/>\nequally<br/>\nquick click of a dull stud tearing a hole through tissue. a good<br/>\nprofessional piercer can move a needle just as fast as the gun<br/>\nmoves the stud.<br/>\n<br/>\n- the ear is less sensitive when it has proper room to swell. even<br/>\nmy<br/>\nlarge gauge ear piercings were MUCH less sore the next day than my<br/>\nregular gauge gunned earlobe piercings, even though the procedure<br/>\nof my larger ones (pierce at 12ga, tapered stretch immediately to<br/>\n6ga * ) was rather traumatic to the lobe tissues.<br/>\n( * initial stretching this quickly was improper. i had asked to<br/>\nbe pierced at 10ga, which would have prevented the slight tearing<br/>\ni experienced along the edges of the cresent cut by the needle.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwhy a gun piercing is superior to a needle piercing:<br/>\n<br/>\n- gun piercings generally run two for ten dollars. needle piercings,<br/>\nincluding the jewelry, are normally twenty for one, depending on<br/>\nthe chosen jewlery.<br/>\n<br/>\n- gun piercings look less scary than needle piercings. there are<br/>\nless<br/>\ntools involved & no inch & a half long needle. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nany body part other than an ear generally cannot be fit into a gun.<br/>\nthere<br/>\nhave been cases of nipple & navel pierces with a gun, but they can<br/>\neasily<br/>\nbe torn out with such a small gauge, & as well, there&#39;s no room for<br/>\nthe<br/>\nbody part to swell (& body piercings often swell much more than<br/>\nearlobes.)<br/>\ni&#39;ve covered the two major reasons cartilage shouldn&#39;t be pierced<br/>\nwith a<br/>\ngun, due to the stud itself, & that doesn&#39;t even get into<br/>\nsterilization.<br/>\nlobes can be pierced successfully at 18ga, although the stud still<br/>\nleaves<br/>\ninsufficient room for swelling, as well as the evil of the butterfly<br/>\nbacks.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2294225,"authorName":"freeform@juno.com","from":"freeform@...","profile":"freeform_ca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ear piercing","postDate":"1012494738","msgId":3579,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMTMxLjA5NDE1NS4tMzg4MzczLjEuZnJlZWZvcm1AanVuby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":3573,"nextInTopic":3588,"prevInTime":3578,"nextInTime":3580,"topicId":3554,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Thu, 31 Jan 2002 07:59:03 -0500 Pat Cald...  ...
