I knew I&#39;d get some mind-easing feedback from you<br/>\nguys.  I&#39;m in a hs group near me composed of some pretty decent people, but<br/>\nmost of the kids are &quot;classically&quot; educated.  The only unschoolers in the<br/>\ngroup are very young, so I have really nobody firsthand to talk to here.  As<br/>\nfor comparing my son to my daughter - I&#39;d say actually I&#39;m very good about<br/>\nnot doing that.. they&#39;ve been very different from each other always.  :)<br/>\nAnd I have an 18 year old daughter as well who&#39;s different still.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus my mom was very big (and still is) about &quot;comparing&quot; kids... making one<br/>\nfeel like less than wonderful because another has done something she feels<br/>\nis superior.  Supposedly, this is motivational.  I know how damaging this<br/>\ncan be.  First it was me and my younger sister (2 years younger than me),<br/>\nthen it was my oldest daughter and my youngest sister (a year older than my<br/>\ndaughter), now it&#39;s my son and my neice (who&#39;s a year younger than he is and<br/>\nof course a raging genious according to my mom.)  Luckily, I live very far<br/>\naway, so the torment is directed at me and only by phone on the rare<br/>\noccasions I talk to her.  I don&#39;t understand why she does this, but she<br/>\nalways has.  Needless to say I feel I can&#39;t go back &quot;home&quot; til my kids are<br/>\ngrown.  I love mom, but she&#39;s a terrible, ego-destroying influence.  And as<br/>\nyou may be able to guess, completely against this home schooling.  She&#39;d<br/>\nprobably charter a red-eye flight out here if she knew I was going so far as<br/>\nto &quot;unschool&quot;.  (Can you say - the gates of hell have opened?)  lol... so<br/>\nanyway... thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love to hear about the kinds of activities your son enjoys!  I&#39;m forever<br/>\nlooking for things to keep Jay entertained!  Thanks again.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Alyce</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11557,"nextTopicId":11572}}
