Of course, just when my life is at its most hectic, our toilet <br/>\noverflows upstairs and causes...$30,000 worth of damage!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI came home to find it &quot;raining&quot; in the kitchen (through the recessed <br/>\nlights). My daughter was downstairs in the basement and heard it, but <br/>\nfigured it was an outside sound. Both upstairs bathroom floors have to <br/>\nbe replaced, the wood floors downstairs have to be replaced (kitchen, <br/>\ndinette, halls, mudroom, half-bath, front entry). Our kitchen cupboards <br/>\nare in the garage (holes were punched in the walls to get to the <br/>\nmoisture behind them) and their contents are all over the living-room <br/>\nand art room (formerly diningroom). The kitchen center island is in the <br/>\ndinette. The dinette table and chairs are in the family room. We had <br/>\nindustrial fans going day and night for several days (like living with <br/>\nan airplane engine on all the time).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of all this, our oldest cat, Tiger, has just been diagnosed with <br/>\nhyperthyroidism and is failing fast. I&#39;m having to make a decision in <br/>\nthe next day or two about euthanizing him. It&#39;s not just the thyroid <br/>\nthing, but several other things that are unspecified. I&#39;ve already spent <br/>\na lot of money on tests and the vet says we need more to find out what&#39;s <br/>\ngoing on--and then we might not have happy options. He&#39;s not really <br/>\neating how and my daughter and I are supposed to be hydrating him every <br/>\nother day. (A needle in his back which introduces a lot of water <br/>\nsubcutaneously.) He HATED it the first time, although it made him feel <br/>\nbetter. He&#39;s so weak that it feels cruel to make him suffer through <br/>\nthat. I want an island of quiet time to deal with this--to hold him and, <br/>\nif we euthanize, to make a ceremony of it (the vet will come out). I&#39;ve <br/>\nput the workmen on hold for a week, but I can&#39;t stop the play or my <br/>\ninvolvement in it. Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is still in Australia and knows nothing about the house <br/>\ndamage--what can he do from 10,000 miles away except worry? He&#39;s very <br/>\nsad about Tiger, though, and says he thinks of him every day. It&#39;s so <br/>\nsad that Tiger likely won&#39;t be here when Eric gets back.<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Homeschool theater","postDate":"1018250129","msgId":6080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNDA4MDcxNTI5LjcwNTIwLnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzA4Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCODY0NEMwLTQ3REEtMTFENi04NzZDLTAwNTBFNDg1N0U0NkBhdHRiaS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":6018,"nextInTopic":6152,"prevInTime":6079,"nextInTime":6081,"topicId":6004,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Roy and I really really reallly enjoyed the video of Wizard of Oz!!
