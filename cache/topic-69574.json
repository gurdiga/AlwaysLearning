Very young children are most interested in very immediate choices. Somewhere between age 3 and 5 though, kids become much more interested in discovering how things get into the house in the first place - and they want to be involved in the decision making. It&#39;s part of how they learn about the world. Around that same time, children&#39;s taste in food often becomes very conservative and they develop strong preferences for sweet and mild foods. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194427255,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;jmarkoski@...&gt;","profile":"jmarkoski","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Candy was Re: TV/DVDs and under-2s","postDate":"1351833261","msgId":69577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs2dmtyZCtmaWFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQwNC1FQVMzMzdCN0M5RkUwQzVCMzE1OEI5NzE4MTlENjcwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":69575,"nextInTopic":69578,"prevInTime":69576,"nextInTime":69578,"topicId":69574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is obviously anecdotal, but my three kids (3, 5, and 7 years old) have full access to about the 3 pounds of Halloween candy collected and left over and it","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-918649812\">This is obviously anecdotal, but my three kids (3, 5, and 7 years old) have full access to about the 3 pounds of Halloween candy collected and left over and it is simply not special or overly tempting to them. My 3 yo daughter typically has a sweet tooth (loves Nerds, especially) but even she is eating very little of the booty. They have always had choice in what and when they eat and is probably why they enjoy this stuff in moderation.

Yesterday our 18mo daughter tasted candy for the first time. She was having a great time passing it out to the trick-or-treaters and then kept holding a piece while she watched tv with Grandma. When i looked, I noticed that she had something in her mouth. She had opened the Kit Kat and started eating some. It had gotten really crumbly and slimy from her eating it, so I asked for that one and opened a new one and gave a piece to her. (My gut reaction was to say no, take it away and say that candy isn&#39;t for Sparrow. However, that didn&#39;t feel kind at all. So I chose the kinder option.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This morning she spotted the orange pumpkin with the candy she collected last night and really wanted it. I realized that if I didn&#39;t want her to have it, it would have been better to put it away. Alas it was too late, so I said that i didn&#39;t want her eating candy first thing in the morning, put the candy out of sight (which made her very upset), and found an all fruit leather (which made her much happier), that is still pretty much all sugar, but fructose, so in my mind more appropriate for a little one.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; These are my challenges:<br/>\n&gt; 1) I want to offer choices from the start, but I&#39;m having a hard time including candy (and other super sugary foods like juice) in that because I still feel like 18 months is too young to be eating candy. She eats a variety of food and we pretty much only offer food we approve of, so it doesn&#39;t come up often. But I have no idea what arbitrary age I&#39;m setting that would make me say yes to as much candy as she chose to eat. <br/>\n&gt; 2) which leads to my second challenge of not trusting her to make all her own food choices yet because of my underlying fear of her getting unhealthy eating habits and becoming overweight later in life.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d love help getting a better perspective on this and hearing about what&#39;s worked with really little ones and candy/food.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you!<br/>\n&gt; love, sarah<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Candy was Re: TV/DVDs and under-2s","postDate":"1351817816","msgId":69575,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMyMTg5MUExLTAxNEItNEZCRC05REEwLTk2RjgwREFBNTY2QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBWTQwNC1FQVMzMzdCN0M5RkUwQzVCMzE1OEI5NzE4MTlENjcwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PEJBWTQwNC1FQVMzMzdCN0M5RkUwQzVCMzE1OEI5NzE4MTlENjcwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":69574,"nextInTopic":69577,"prevInTime":69574,"nextInTime":69576,"topicId":69574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Yesterday our 18mo daughter tasted candy for the first time. She was having a great time passing it out to the trick-or-treaters and then kept holding a piece while she watched tv with Grandma. When i looked, I noticed that she had something in her mouth. She had opened the Kit Kat and started eating some. It had gotten really crumbly and slimy from her eating it, so I asked for that one and opened a new one and gave a piece to her. (My gut reaction was to say no, take it away and say that candy isn&#39;t for Sparrow. However, that didn&#39;t feel kind at all. So I chose the kinder option.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning she spotted the orange pumpkin with the candy she collected last night and really wanted it. I realized that if I didn&#39;t want her to have it, it would have been better to put it away. Alas it was too late, so I said that i didn&#39;t want her eating candy first thing in the morning, put the candy out of sight (which made her very upset), and found an all fruit leather (which made her much happier), that is still pretty much all sugar, but fructose, so in my mind more appropriate for a little one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my challenges:<br/>\n1) I want to offer choices from the start, but I&#39;m having a hard time including candy (and other super sugary foods like juice) in that because I still feel like 18 months is too young to be eating candy. She eats a variety of food and we pretty much only offer food we approve of, so it doesn&#39;t come up often. But I have no idea what arbitrary age I&#39;m setting that would make me say yes to as much candy as she chose to eat. <br/>\n2) which leads to my second challenge of not trusting her to make all her own food choices yet because of my underlying fear of her getting unhealthy eating habits and becoming overweight later in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d love help getting a better perspective on this and hearing about what&#39;s worked with really little ones and candy/food.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!<br/>\nlove, sarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69700,"nextTopicId":69698}}
