And then I can say &quot;How&#39;s it <br/>\ngoing?&quot; and if she needs to vent to do a reality check moment, or run <br/>\nsomething by me, she can go back to the situation refreshed.

There&#39;s a boy (whose <br/>\nsister&#39;s Holly&#39;s friend) who bugs her and has for years.  We&#39;ve been asked to <br/>\ngive him and his sister a ride a couple of places, coming up--tomorrow and <br/>\nthen next Wednesday.  Both times, Holly&#39;s face just fell and she had the <br/>\n&quot;GOSH I should say yes, but...&quot; look.  So she went to check with her dad <br/>\n(who&#39;s driving to swimming) and while she was out of the room, I took the <br/>\nphone and told the mom Holly&#39;s having a problem with the boy.  We discussed <br/>\nit some.  It was news to the mom.  She threatened to have a long, strong talk <br/>\nwith him.  I said I thought he might just  need to be asked to be nicer, and <br/>\nI said he&#39;s been kinda yucky with me too, when his mom&#39;s not around.  <br/>\nPurposely difficult.  And I said Holly didn&#39;t want him to get in big trouble, <br/>\njust wanted the mom to be aware.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll see.  I felt bad saying that, but I felt bad letting Holly come to me <br/>\nrepeatedly and say &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do,&quot; and for all the suggestions and <br/>\nnew tactics to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I&#39;m off one side of the tightrope, and sometimes off the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll get older, that&#39;s for sure.

She doesn&#39;t want to feel<br/>\nthat way about her friends and about herself when it&#39;s all over.  And I&#39;d<br/>\nagree with you it probably has a lot to do with hormonal changes and the<br/>\nchanging dynamics of her friendships if some of the others are going<br/>\nthrough this too.  Being tired or hungry  or sick or hurting has a real<br/>\neffect on how we interact with each other so your right on to address<br/>\nthose things too.  <br/>\nMaybe the two of you could come up with something she could do to diffuse<br/>\nherself when she starts feeling anxious or stressed or frustrated.  <br/>\nMaybe there is a technique she could try to give herself some time to<br/>\ncalm.  A sort of counting to ten or like smokers do, snap a rubber band<br/>\non their wrist.  ( I don&#39;t really recommend the rubber band thing )  But<br/>\nsomething she thinks would be calming.  <br/>\nPart of escalating frustration is not knowing any other way.   <br/>\nI know one girl who breaths deeply and swoops her hair away and up like a<br/>\npony tail.  It&#39;s part physical action to redirect the adrenaline and part<br/>\nphysically cooling.<br/>\nRemember that this is a physical thing that&#39;s happening to her and a<br/>\nphysical action to counter it might be more effective.  People<br/>\ninstinctively know this which is why, sadly, lots of people who get to a<br/>\nhighly agitated state physically hurt themselves or someone else.  And in<br/>\nold movies when someone is hysterical the hero gives them a good slap. <br/>\nYour daughter&#39;s not hitting anyone else, so that&#39;s something!<br/>\nI used to have a huge problem with anger and I found the best way for me<br/>\nto diffuse it was with regular physical activity.  I run.  When I&#39;m mad I<br/>\nrun farther! = )<br/>\nMaybe this would help your daughter, if she likes swimming or dancing or<br/>\nsomething.  I don&#39;t know.  <br/>\nI think the most important thing is that you&#39;re not jumping all over her.<br/>\n I&#39;m sorry about that other mother, but you&#39;re right not to listen to<br/>\nher.  Nobody wants to feel this way!   Keep talking to her and telling<br/>\nher she&#39;s ok and that she&#39;ll find a more comfortable way to cope.

These are happening when <br/>\ntrying to work on things with some other kids. She&#39;s stamping her feet and <br/>\nraising her voice and saying, emotionally, &quot;I&#39;m so frustrated. You aren&#39;t <br/>\nLISTENING. I can&#39;t even WORK with you anymore. I GIVE UP.&quot;  Stuff like <br/>\nthat.... and then bursting into tears and stomping off. Other times it is <br/>\nthat she has hurt feelings - sometimes not even over what someone has said, <br/>\nbut just their tone of voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the other moms sees her outbursts as manipulative attempts to just get <br/>\nher own way and has told me that I should &quot;stop letting her get away with <br/>\nit.&quot;  I told her that my style is to be kind and understanding at the time <br/>\nand then, later, when she&#39;s totally over it - maybe in the car on the way <br/>\nhome - that that is the time I talk to her about what happened. This other <br/>\nmom says, &quot;If it was my kid I&#39;d nail her butt right when it is happening,&quot; <br/>\nand she says she thinks it isn&#39;t effective to wait until later to &quot;deal with <br/>\nit.&quot; Well - she also said, &quot;She needs to learn to use words,&quot; and I didn&#39;t <br/>\nthink to say it then, but she IS using words, of course, she isn&#39;t hitting <br/>\nanybody or anything like that -- she&#39;s using lots of words - usually starting <br/>\nout with, &quot;Listen - are you listening? You aren&#39;t listening.&quot; And then <br/>\nescalating into really loud angry emotional words. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow - naturally - I&#39;m spending some considerable time talking to her <br/>\nprivately about these outbursts. We talk about how she&#39;s feeling, what kinds <br/>\nof things are happening when she starts feeling so explosive, what she&#39;s <br/>\ndoing when she starts getting frustrated and what ELSE she might try and what <br/>\nhappens when she explodes and what effect it has on others and all kinds of <br/>\nstuff like that.  And I&#39;ve talked to her about being sure SHE is listening to <br/>\nthe other kids and not ONLY trying to get them to listen to her. And I&#39;ve <br/>\nmade more effort to get her enough sleep and in not letting her get hungry <br/>\nand stuff like that. She does seem to be going through a growth spurt - and <br/>\nthese periods of disequilibrium have always coincided with growth spurts for <br/>\nher. And she&#39;s starting to develop physically - and so are her friends, <br/>\nespecially one of the girls she has the most trouble with who also has <br/>\nsimilar kinds of screaming/crying meltdowns - so I&#39;m sure hormones are <br/>\ninvolved, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - how would you handle this?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4491,"nextTopicId":4510}}
