Fortunately, we had<br/>\nchosen a ped that allowed me to make choices for my child &lt;g&gt;.

I knew that thing in me could have been bad, and I wanted<br/>\nit gone.  Thankfully, my HMO physician felt the same way and we got my<br/>\nstudies done quickly and when the studies showed wait and see, he and I did<br/>\nnot feel comfortable with that.  He helped me to find a female surgeon who<br/>\nspecialized in the breast and we got the lump out.  No, wait and repeat as<br/>\nthe mammogram/radiology suggested - no &quot;no lump found&quot; as the ultrasound<br/>\nreported.  I saw my surgeon, she saw the lump on the ultrasound - she found<br/>\nit on palpation right away - she asked ME what I wanted to do.  I said I<br/>\nwanted it gone, it didn&#39;t need to be there and I didn&#39;t want to make friends<br/>\nwith it and watch its growth pattern for the next x months.  So, its gone,<br/>\nI&#39;m fine and went back to work when I felt ready.  No more watch and see,<br/>\njust do monthly self exams and mammo when 38.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t say any of this is related to unschooling as I have been very aware<br/>\nof my body since I can remember.
