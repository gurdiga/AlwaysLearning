There you are in your<br/>\nembroidered apron, finishing the last of the early-morning dishes,<br/>\nwith a beef roast and peeled potatoes already simmering in the slow<br/>\ncooker on a spotless countertop. &quot;I can sit here and help you all<br/>\nthe rest of the morning,&quot; you say, smiling, to your little<br/>\nangels. &quot;Let&#39;s start with that math test.&quot; Cheers erupt all around<br/>\nas your family begins yet another day of perfect homeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever fantasized about a homeschool situation like this? If<br/>\nso, you know that it only takes a few moments of daydreaming before<br/>\nreality sets in. Then you&#39;re back to unswept floors, scattered toys<br/>\nand clutter, a ten-foot-high pile of laundry, grumpy toddlers,<br/>\nhormonal teens . . . and the list goes on. But surely, somewhere,<br/>\nyou think, even if it seems all wrong for you, there must be<br/>\nhomeschoolers who are doing this right , homeschoolers who are<br/>\nperfect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAren&#39;t there?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer is no.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year, when I researched and wrote a book called Real-Life<br/>\nHomeschooling: The Stories of 21 Families Who Teach Their Children<br/>\nat Home , I never found a perfect homeschooler. True, some are<br/>\nbetter organized or more experienced than others. Some have children<br/>\nwith easygoing temperaments. A few are blessed with floors that<br/>\ndon&#39;t show dirt.

Yet<br/>\nhomeschoolers, in particular, seem to share a tendency to believe<br/>\nthat if they just work hard enough, they can produce the perfect<br/>\nhomeschool. We compare ourselves to others, and we often note how<br/>\nmuch better another family &quot;has it together,&quot; rather than<br/>\nunderstanding that they, like us, also struggle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe we need to remember four important points.<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) There is no perfect curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine who sells books at homeschool curriculum fairs<br/>\nreports that desperate mothers often come to her for advice on<br/>\nbuying the &quot;right&quot; curriculum. It&#39;s hard for these women to believe<br/>\nthat there is no right curriculum. I thought it amusing that some of<br/>\nthe families in my book recommended one particular math curriculum<br/>\nas one of their favorite resources, while other families found it<br/>\ntedious. Is that curriculum, then, a good or bad curriculum? It all<br/>\ndepends on your particular family&#39;s goals, methods, learning styles,<br/>\nand a dozen other considerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd how does one know whether a curriculum will work or not? Most<br/>\nhomeschoolers I interviewed said they simply chose something, jumped<br/>\nin and began using it, then made adjustments as they saw the need<br/>\narise. One family, for example, started with one and abandoned it<br/>\nwhen they discovered their children learned better through using a<br/>\nmore hands-on approach. Another family tried a different one, but<br/>\nfound their daughter was distracted by the colorful pictures on the<br/>\npages; they returned to their former program and have been perfectly<br/>\nsatisfied with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne interviewee, now a college student, told me he wished his well-<br/>\nmeaning mother had chosen one curriculum, however imperfect, and<br/>\nstayed with it, rather than jumping from program to program. In<br/>\nresponse, his mother explained that she always believed she could<br/>\nsolve all her problems by finding the perfect curriculum . . . and<br/>\nfinally had to admit that there was no such thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) There is no perfect method of teaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nI interviewed families who use a variety of teaching methods, such<br/>\nas traditional textbooks, unit studies, the Charlotte Mason method,<br/>\nand the classical approach. One woman utilizes a video school. Other<br/>\nfamilies &quot;unschool,&quot; encouraging their children to lead and<br/>\nstructure their own learning goals, with parents acting primarily as<br/>\nresources rather than teachers.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, many of the families I profiled started out &quot;rigid&quot;<br/>\nand &quot;school-like,&quot; as they described themselves and then relaxed<br/>\nconsiderably through the years. Those using textbooks, for example,<br/>\noften supplemented with other books and activities and sometimes<br/>\nmade a break with the program to discover other areas of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers found they needed more structure as their children grew.<br/>\nSusie, one of the parents I interviewed who formerly used an<br/>\neclectic, casual approach to homeschooling, wrote, &quot;We completely<br/>\nswitched gears and started using (a program that was organized for<br/>\nus), a big change but a major relief. I couldn&#39;t keep up with<br/>\nschooling and was getting very concerned about it.&quot; Susie says the<br/>\nfamily had &quot;no trouble at all switching from a very loose approach<br/>\nto a complete curriculum.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(3) There is no perfectly clean house, especially when homeschoolers<br/>\nlive there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my interviewees, Janice, observed that our houses are<br/>\nnaturally messy because so many of us live and interact there all<br/>\nday as well as all night. Families who work, school, and play away<br/>\nfrom home should find it much easier to keep their places clean and<br/>\ntidy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral mothers I interviewed have elaborate chore systems and<br/>\ncharts in place. Others (usually those with smaller families)<br/>\nsimply &quot;pick the kid who happens to be in the room at the time,&quot; as<br/>\nLynda said, &quot;and he&#39;s the one who gets to do the job.&quot; In Bobby and<br/>\nNina&#39;s family of eleven children, a child who complains that he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like a job has the &quot;opportunity&quot; to learn to like it by<br/>\ndoing extra duty until he stops complaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, as Angie lamented, &quot;My house is always messy, even though the<br/>\nchildren do have chores.&quot; One interviewee&#39;s husband often reminds<br/>\nhis wife that &quot;the house will be clean some day . . . after the kids<br/>\nhave all left home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n(4) There is no perfect family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome families do get up earlier than yours. Some may actually have<br/>\ndinner in the slow cooker by 9:00 A.M. And there really are some<br/>\ndays when a few homeschool moms have time to sit down with their<br/>\nkids all morning, helping with assignments. This doesn&#39;t mean the<br/>\nfamilies are perfect or even better than yours.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I wrote about twenty-one families&#39; lives, I found it difficult to<br/>\nconvey that each had struggles. Describing the good stuff was easy;<br/>\nin fact, when these homeschoolers&#39; accomplishments were listed on<br/>\npaper, the lists were truly impressive. It was much harder to convey<br/>\nthe frustrations, irritations, and occasional deep disappointments<br/>\nof daily living.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does one fully describe, for example, the effects of sleep<br/>\ndeprivation caused by a colicky newborn? The tiresomeness of dealing<br/>\nwith a child with ADHD? The feelings of vulnerability that come in<br/>\nthe midst of a financial crisis? When the inevitable pressures of<br/>\nlife are added to two full-time commitmentsparenting and<br/>\nhomeschoolingit&#39;s no wonder that we sometimes &quot;lose it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to laugh when Susie described a time when she was pregnant<br/>\nwith her fourth child: &quot;I was so tired and sick and grouchy, I found<br/>\nI was overreacting to everything,&quot; she says. &quot;A child would spell a<br/>\nword wrong and I&#39;d cry, feeling that he&#39;d never learn.&quot; I can<br/>\nremember going through times like that, and worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast year I got a Christmas letter from a friend, a homeschool<br/>\nmother of five, who now lives in another state. It was quite an<br/>\nimpressive letter.

As I finished reading<br/>\nthe letter, I couldn&#39;t help but compare my own homeschool with that<br/>\nof this supermom&#39;s. I wondered how she did it all. I also<br/>\nquestioned, a little, whether I was doing enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I received a letter from Fran in response to our family&#39;s<br/>\nChristmas letter. &quot;I get dizzy reading all you&#39;ve done,&quot; she said.<br/>\nIronically, that had been my reaction, exactly, to her letter. How<br/>\ntempting to compare ourselves to other homeschoolers, the ones who<br/>\nhave perfect curricula, teaching methods, families, and clean<br/>\nhouses!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again, perfect people don&#39;t exist.
