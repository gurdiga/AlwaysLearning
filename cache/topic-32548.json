As my daughter s friends started school they had little time","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2112330885\">Hi Marcia--<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice to you is to look for other unschoolers/homeschoolers and don&#39;t look back.  As <br/>\nmy daughter&#39;s friends started school they had little time for her.  There was some time in <br/>\nkindergarten, but on into 1st and 2nd grade they really disappeared.  Seek out new friends <br/>\nof like mind and build your tribe--sometimes it not easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nUntil we moved I was driving 1 1/2 hours each way to hook up with unschoolers.  I <br/>\nthought I&#39;d never do that, but my efforts to create a community where I lived just didn&#39;t <br/>\nwork.  We also started going to unschooling conferences, campouts, etc.  We really looked <br/>\nto create a different sort of life than the school people were leading.  I have to say the <br/>\npayoff for the whole family has been soooo worth it.  Neither of my children are feeling at <br/>\nall lacking for friends and we have a very grounding feeling of belonging to smaller <br/>\ncommunities within larger communities.  There is a feeling of rightness that permeates <br/>\nour lives, even when we are spending days on end at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not suggesting that you need to do what I did--but you may have to get out of your <br/>\ncomfort zone if that&#39;s what&#39;s called for.  Your lives will be so filled that your daughter <br/>\nwon&#39;t feel a lack.  I know my response wasn&#39;t quite what you asked, but I know enough <br/>\npeople whose problem was that their child then wanted to go to school because all of her <br/>\nfriends had gone off to school that I thought I&#39;d save you the trouble of typing up that <br/>\npost and just answer it.  :-) Good luck, Joanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;mdfisher23&quot; &lt;mfisher@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi,<br/>\n&gt; My dd (5)will not be attending kindergarten with friends that she has <br/>\n&gt; grown up around since birth.

Maybe the two of you could start  <br/>\na photography project,  maybe a blog of the fun things you do together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInvite her friends over sometimes and keep them all so busy with fun  <br/>\nstuff that they don&#39;t have time or need to talk about school.

Or take them all to an  <br/>\namusement park or Chuck E Cheese or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will cost money for you to go that direction, but a visit with a  <br/>\ncounsellor can be $80, $100 or more, and if this can prevent  <br/>\nunhappiness and problems, it&#39;s money well spent.
