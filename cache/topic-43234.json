I had  <br/>\nfood cooking and couldn&#39;t leave.  The store is very near, quick  <br/>\nwalking distance.  Usually when Keith gets home, his routine is to  <br/>\ncheck the mail and change his clothes.  I greeted him and thought...   <br/>\nHolly was on her way home, more or less, somewhere, and I could ask  <br/>\nher.  But the list was here, and I wasn&#39;t sure when Holly would call  <br/>\nme back.   Keith wasn&#39;t limping (his back&#39;s been hurting) and he  <br/>\nwalked like he was happy, so I asked him if he could go.  If he had  <br/>\nsaid no, I wouldn&#39;t have whined or pressed.  I&#39;d&#39;ve probably called  <br/>\nHolly again, or turned off the stove and gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s mom (my mother in law) had her arm amputated.  She&#39;s 90 or  <br/>\nso.  She has tumor on the bones and it just wasn&#39;t going to heal or  <br/>\naccept a pin or plate.    Kirby (my oldest, 22)  was moving from his  <br/>\napartment to a house that week, and then going to a conference.  He  <br/>\nwas really happy to hang out with Brett (Holly&#39;s boyfriend, and one of  <br/>\nKirby&#39;s best friends for years), and Rosie Sorooshian, and Holly  <br/>\n(Holly was third no matter which order the other two were in), and so  <br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell him about his grandmother.  I considered telling him on  <br/>\nthe way to the airport, but the mood was light and I know he didn&#39;t  <br/>\ntake his uncle&#39;s death in 2007 very well.  I didn&#39;t want him to think  <br/>\nabout it all the way to Austin, by himself.  I told him by phone a few  <br/>\ndays later, when he was home and recovered and in a calm mood.  We  <br/>\ntalked about it and he talked to his dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI predicted what he would need in terms of processing.  I didn&#39;t want  <br/>\nto take any time or energy or focus out of the conference and his  <br/>\nvisit with friends.  I didn&#39;t want to make him afraid or unhappy or  <br/>\nunsettled.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Bill (not his real name) was here talking about AA meetings  <br/>\na week ago.  I gave him a copy of Daily Affirmations, because half his  <br/>\nproblems are about parents, and stepparents, and alcohol, drugs,  <br/>\nirresponsibility.   Half his problem is his own drinking, and he had  <br/>\nbeen sober a week or ten days or something.  He got drunk Saturday  <br/>\nnight (not here, but where Marty was in another town).  Usually we  <br/>\ntalk every few days.  I know he had planned to come by here before he  <br/>\nwent on through Albuquerque to his own home elsewhere.   It&#39;s  <br/>\nThursday.  It&#39;s been a week since we talked.  Usually we talk more.  I  <br/>\ncould call him but he will take it as a &quot;visitation,&quot; as a checking  <br/>\nin, like a mom calling a bad kid or something.  So I&#39;m going to wait  <br/>\nuntil he figures out how he wants to discuss it, if he wants to  <br/>\ndiscuss it. I&#39;m not mad at him.  I just don&#39;t want to impose on what  <br/>\nis probably an unsettled and embarrassing set of thoughts for him.  By  <br/>\nthe time I talk to him he will have had a counselling session or two,  <br/>\ntalked with his wife, maybe gone to more AA meetings or thought about  <br/>\nwhy he doesn&#39;t want to, and I won&#39;t press him to share what he doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with my kids when they were young (as one of those was my child,  <br/>\nthough he&#39;s a man living in another state).  Same with any  <br/>\nconsiderations of whether it&#39;s a good time to say more or to be quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=Otherwise,- William dreams to become a pilot that travels through  <br/>\nspace and sea.

I figure even if what someone says isn&#39;t<br/>\nright, it&#39;s more ideas than I had before.  As a kid though... I agree it&#39;s<br/>\nbetter not to quash a child&#39;s wondering aloud or fact finding.

He puts things out there to test them and at times I<br/>\nwonder if he wants me to be part of that or not.  Most of the time, I think<br/>\nnot.  When I do that, I usually do want to know what others think.  Which<br/>\nexplains why I like lists and forums.  It helps that I don&#39;t take everything<br/>\nas fact though.  ;)  I hope others do the same because that&#39;s the truth.<br/>\nDon&#39;t believe everything you hear, read or think.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Is it necessary to correct?","postDate":"1237373365","msgId":43238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEQwMTg1QUU2LUY3MDItNDhERS05OUU1LTU5RjY0NkU1QkZGNkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDkwMzE3MTYxMGozYTIyNzIzMmtiOTkyOWY3NTQxOTY5NzlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDkwMzE3MTYxMGozYTIyNzIzMmtiOTkyOWY3NTQxOTY5NzlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43237,"nextInTopic":43239,"prevInTime":43237,"nextInTime":43239,"topicId":43234,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
