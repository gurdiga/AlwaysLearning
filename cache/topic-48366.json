I would say off the top of my head that 3 good places to start are Sandra Dodd&#39;s Website, Joyfully Rejoycing, and Anne Ohman - google these 3 and you will have enough to keep you busy for awhile.  The important thing though is to not spend all your time reading about it and just be with your kids :) I wish you well on your journey.  This list is also a great resource - it is an exchange of ideas rather than a place of &quot;support&quot; though.

I&#39;ve tried to find books on it but haven&#39;t found any real practical help. I&#39;m kind of a &quot;free spirit&quot; and am finding it difficult to be tied to workbooks all day when I&#39;d rather be baking or sewing or taking a walk with my kids but I&#39;m afraid that I don&#39;t know how to teach them all that they need to learn if I don&#39;t rely on a boring workbook.  I had an image of what my homeschool would look like and it&#39;s just not even close.  I want it to be joyful and fun. I&#39;m looking forward to learning from you all. Thanks for sharing.
