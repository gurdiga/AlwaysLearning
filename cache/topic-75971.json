Do you agree or disagree -=-<br/>\nBut the person accidentally replied instead of forwarding.  It happens fairly often, and it&#39;s interesting for me to see what people have written to a spouse, or sibling, or friend.  Usually it&#39;s positive (this is great, or you&#39;ll like this).<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I&#39;m sifting through a huge collection of writing, I wouldn&#39;t put anything up that&#39;s not already twice good—written, collected, saved, found again, chosen and shared.  I guess that&#39;s way more than &quot;twice good.&quot;   <br/>\n<br/>\nEmotional well-being, as many people know, can&#39;t be separated from physical well-being.  Worshipers of the King James Bible sometimes think the soul/spirit is separate from the body and that instincts.  Worshipers of &quot;nutrition&quot; think that bodies are built of molecules and unaffected by fear, shame or control, but anyone who&#39;s studied the least bit of child development knows that&#39;s not true.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen something is solid truth,  it just keeps getting truer, though. :-)  This month, a new discovery about the nervous system/brain and the lymph system is in the news.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://neurosciencenews.com/lymphatic-system-brain-neurobiology-2080/\">http://neurosciencenews.com/lymphatic-system-brain-neurobiology-2080/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo I suppose the thing about Jenny&#39;s statement that could be questioned is whether emotional health can be separated from physical health. :-)   It can, because the language and measurements are created by people, and they&#39;re measuring what they can see, and want to see, and have defined as important. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe link to the quote, with a larger context, is:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2015/06/emotional-well-being.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2015/06/emotional-well-being.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75900,"nextTopicId":75927}}
