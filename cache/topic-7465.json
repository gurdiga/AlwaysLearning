Who cares where I start my letters?!?&quot;&nbsp; So we are all back at home now.&nbsp; It&#39;s been cool to see how confident my daughters were in trying out a new situation and in walking away from it when it didn&#39;t feel right.&nbsp; I was able to partner with them to create the experience they were seeking without a bunch of fear and dogma getting in the way.&nbsp; I owe a lot to the things I&#39;ve read on this list over the years.&nbsp; I am a much more calm and confident mom because of it.&nbsp; Thanks, everyone!&nbsp;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"trying school","postDate":"1023210840","msgId":7465,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5NC43ZDgwNzI1LjJhMmU0ZjU4QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72825,"prevInTime":7464,"nextInTime":7466,"topicId":7465,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, One of the moms in my homeschooling group had a daughter that really wanted to try school.
