I&#39;m still hoping you&#39;ll look the book over for a little <br/>\nblurb on the back cover.  I seem to be way behind with my &quot;schedule&quot;.  I did do a <br/>\nhike on the Appalachian Trail, but then needed to come home early, <br/>\nunexpectedly, as my son Devin had a serious accident.  He&#39;s had surgery,and has re-hab.  <br/>\nThey are thinking he will re-gain the use of his right hand, but it will take <br/>\nmany months.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the Inn owner was shuttling me to the bus so that I could get home, he <br/>\nsaid my son should realize how lucky he was to have a mom that would cut her <br/>\nhike short, because he was hurt.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t say anything, but I can&#39;t imagine a mom who wouldn&#39;t need to get <br/>\nhome to an injured child.  I don&#39;t think hiking by myself for days with Devin on <br/>\nmy mind would have done anything but make me crazy!!<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16330,"nextTopicId":16355}}
