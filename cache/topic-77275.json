Split the difference? I&#39;ve been trying to find the post I made - either here or the Facebook group - about her suddenly reading something new aloud for the first time (and perfectly) and her choice of material being the user manual for the Alice computer graphics program. Seems like that would be a good pinpoint date - but I haven&#39;t found it yet.<div><br></div><div>It&#39;s interesting that her memory of how she started reading and my observations of her process are different. She doesn&#39;t really remember a time of not being able to read at least partly, and she recalls the period when she sounded out words from their letters very clearly. Whereas I recall the much longer period before that skill developed, of her recognizing whole words, and making good guesses at what words could be from the first letter and the context. Seems to me she always saw words in terms of whole syllables even when she was sounding out. It is really rare that she will pronounce a newly read word wrongly now (16).</div><div><br></div><div>Robyn C.</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":426714371,"authorName":"Niki Rose","from":"Niki Rose &lt;niki.l.rose@...&gt;","profile":"niki.rose@rocketmail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Reading age data","postDate":"1467764708","msgId":77285,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBK1dYZHl4NEhEWDROcC1KV0tyNlExWEZRSnFaVnNWRkxrXzBPUHlRcDJMVnQ9eUJ3d0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFZJMVBSMDcwMU1CMTkwMkJFNDcyNjNDOUYxNTZDQjY2Mjk5QjczOTBAVkkxUFIwNzAxTUIxOTAyLmV1cnByZDA3LnByb2Qub3V0bG9vay5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PFZJMVBSMDcwMU1CMTkwMkJFNDcyNjNDOUYxNTZDQjY2Mjk5QjczOTBAVkkxUFIwNzAxTUIxOTAyLmV1cnByZDA3LnByb2Qub3V0bG9vay5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":77283,"nextInTopic":77304,"prevInTime":77284,"nextInTime":77286,"topicId":77275,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sorry Jo if this is too late.
