We&#39;ve learned to communicate in brief snatches while the kids are around, and then we sometimes have a little bit of quiet time in the evening, but often my partner goes to bed not long after the kids - then I get my Always Learning time! If we have visitors over, my expectation is that I will still need to spend some time with the kids while my partner looks after our guests.  But honestly, we don&#39;t have people over all that often, and my partner and I rarely go out.  While the kids are still so young I&#39;d rather keep things simple.  Of course, I enjoy catching up with friends, but I do that during the week.
