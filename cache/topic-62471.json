Something I&#39;ve learned to do is to use my imagination to sort of &quot;psych myself out&quot; of my catastrophic imaginings - so when I get to worrying about, say, the house burning down, I push the envelope and imagine that the house is on fire because zombies are taking over the area and we all need to flee into the hills and set up a resistance movement. Pure silliness, but its something that helps me shift from feeling like I&#39;m at the mercy of my worries to being in control of them.

A","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1957440220\">Neo started worrying about a lot of things since around 8.  He comes up with these impossible scenarios and worries about how we would handle ourselves.  A year ago,  I would say things like that the dogs would bark if zombies appeared at our doorstep (this is a central theme in his concerns even though at the time he had never seen a zombie movie ). None of my assurances helped. Talking it out did a little.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThis past summer, he watched zombieland and resident evil, two pretty gruesome zombie flicks. He also started playing shooter games and sometimes the bad guys are zombies.  He also got some zombie story books, from scooby doo to what we are reading now- the undertakers. It may be a coincidence, but we have noticed a different perspective from him about his fears.  Before, he was worried we would most definitely be victims.  Now, he sounds more confident we could take anything that comes through that door.  Last night we watched 2012 and at the end he said, well, we have driving down, handling weapons, and negotiation- but<br/>\nwe should probably learn how fly a plane at least - it could come in handy.  And DH is going to look into flying lessons. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems to me, the movies, the role playing games, the shooter games and being allowed to talk about weapons etc have equipped him with valuable information that helps him envision our survival in the face of disaster.   So maybe some exposure to resolutions / plans/ procedure ICE would be helpful to your son. <br/>\n<br/>\nBurial<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Aug 24, 2011, at 6:36 PM, Jen Beeman &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:taxicrab@...\">taxicrab@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Someone else should spot me on this one, please, but there&#39;s a book and a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; board game called &quot;Worst Case Scenario,&quot; about what to do in emergencies,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and that might be useful.

Some more than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think it is good to dwell on it too much - give it too much <br/>\npower. I&#39;m not saying just dismiss it as if it doesn&#39;t matter - but it <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t take a lot of words or a lot of emotion to very calmly and <br/>\nsweetly say things like, &quot;Remember that you have a mommy and daddy to <br/>\ntake care of you,&quot; and &quot;Your mommy and daddy know what to do in <br/>\nemergencies.&quot; Things like that. I think kids who are extremely <br/>\nimaginative have a harder time with this dawning awareness that bad <br/>\nthings happen randomly. So I wouldn&#39;t fuel their imaginations with worst <br/>\ncase scenario stuff - I mean, poor kid may not have been worrying about <br/>\nsnake or spider bites, for example, so you wouldn&#39;t want to give him <br/>\nmore things to worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, remember that they are still quite egocentric at this age - and <br/>\nalthough it seems like they are worrying about their family, it is <br/>\nprobably more in relation to themselves that they are worried. So the <br/>\nreassuring thing is to tell them that their parents will be able to keep <br/>\ntaking care of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know a kid who started this at about 8 and then it got worse and worse <br/>\nuntil he seemed to be constantly afraid. I think his mom made too big a <br/>\ndeal out of it at the beginning. I remember her shushing other people, <br/>\nincluding other kids, when they would be talking or even playing pretend <br/>\nand something potentially scary would come up naturally. I specifically <br/>\nremember once a kid saying, &quot;Oh, like a volcano erupting,&quot; and the mom <br/>\nordering him in a very tense voice to &quot;Please do NOT talk about <br/>\nvolcanoes erupting. That is too scary.&quot;  I remember thinking that her <br/>\nkid was getting the message that he should be scared of things. Later, <br/>\nas he got older, HE would say things like that, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Child Worries","postDate":"1314205395","msgId":62476,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTQyMDUzOTUuNjcwNTYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEZGOURBNDkwLTdGMTktNDZFNS1BMUFBLUUxNjNEODRDQjgwOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGozMzA1cCthbTllQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RkY5REE0OTAtN0YxOS00NkU1LUExQUEtRTE2M0Q4NENCODA4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62475,"nextInTopic":62477,"prevInTime":62475,"nextInTime":62477,"topicId":62471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-552409059\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;Someone else should spot me on this one, please, but there&#39;s a book and a board game called &quot;Worst Case Scenario,&quot; about what to do in emergencies, and that might be useful.

Because that&#39;s about the time kids start to consider death and other big life changes and to try to figure them out.  It&#39;s a time when kids become afraid to go to sleep, even if they&#39;ve slept fine before, and might become afraid of car rides or dangerous rides or games.  Not all kids, but lots of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone else should spot me on this one, please, but there&#39;s a book and a board game called &quot;Worst Case Scenario,&quot; about what to do in emergencies, and that might be useful.  (BUT if someone who&#39;s familiar with those says it&#39;s a bad idea, that&#39;s important to note.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the old days when people relied on telephone books and there were government sections in the Yellow Pages (for those outside the US, small towns had white pages for residences and a second section on yellow paper for businesses and advertisements; cities had two separate books, with the Yellow Pages being twice as fat or so as the other)...  there would be emergency preparedness pages in there.  When I visited cities away from where I lived, I would always look in the Yellow Pages for three things:  I would look up churches and flip through to see what the proportions were of various kinds of churches, which for me gave a view of what kind of town it might be--and Synagogues and Mosques were listed under churches.  I would flip through to see what there was a big section of that I wasn&#39;t familiar with.  I was in Maryland once and there were PAGES and pages of dehumidifying equipment and professional companies.   But the emergency pages were the coolest.  In the Albuquerq book it talked about what to do if you were going hiking, or if you were stranded in the desert or the mountains and needed to make a signal (in a triangle, of mirrors or reflective objects, or of fires, depending when and where) so that airplanes would spot you and call emergency rescue.  In California it talked about earthquake kits--what to have in advance, and where to stand/lie/hide during an earthquake, if you were home or if you were in a public place.  To turn the gas off.   In Texas and Kansas I had seen tornado pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the particular eight year old, he might enjoy some disaster movies.  You could try a very unlikely one, maybe.  The Poseidon Adventure, or some Titantic movie or other, especially now that there are DVDs with extras talking about how they did the special effects and the stunts.    <br/>\n<br/>\nI learned early on that if I saw a scary movie and just went to sleep, I was way more likely to have bad dreams than if I saw it and talked about it, or stayed awake a while thinking about it, or looked something up about it (in those days, in the encyclopedia, though these days it would be google or youtube).   Minds WILL process thoughts, so maybe if you give him a chance to express what he&#39;s thinking he&#39;ll sleep better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Child Worries","postDate":"1314201607","msgId":62472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTQyMDE2MDcuODc2MC5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViODE1MDIubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGozMzA1cCthbTllQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGozMzA1cCthbTllQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62471,"nextInTopic":62473,"prevInTime":62471,"nextInTime":62473,"topicId":62471,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe ask him  what he worries about and have safety plans  in place that may make him feel more in control.

We sometimes google facts about the individual worry and talk about how likely the it is that the event may happen. Then we go through what we would do if it did occur.
