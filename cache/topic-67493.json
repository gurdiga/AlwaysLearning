Why can&#39;t it be her trying out a solution to see what resonates and doesn&#39;t resonate with her? If she&#39;s free to go and free to stay home, she&#39;s free to try it on to see what the effects are. That&#39;s how we learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool is made up of many parts. There will be parts she likes and parts she doesn&#39;t. There will be parts she doesn&#39;t that she&#39;s willing to put up with to get the parts she does.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere you can help the most is by being receptive to what she tells you of her experiences. Let her feel free to tell you the good and bad without feeling pressure from you to finally see school and home the &quot;right&quot; way. Share your own experiences with her. See her experience as a way of getting to know herself better, getting to know a piece of the world that nearly everyone she meets as an adult will have experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you can do is talk about what she may be looking for through school and also talk about other ways to get those things. *Not* as a way to convince her not to go, but as options so that she doesn&#39;t feel she has to stay in school to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":414737454,"authorName":"sopik@rogers.com","from":"&quot;sopik@...&quot; &lt;sopik@...&gt;","profile":"sopik@rogers.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"My daughter has decided to try school and i have some questions!","postDate":"1338863120","msgId":67493,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpxanFtZysyamgyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":67494,"prevInTime":67492,"nextInTime":67494,"topicId":67493,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Everyone, My daughter Hannah has decided she would like to enroll in school this fall.

She will be entering grade six. Some background...we have been homeschooling for four years. We originally made the decision to homeschool because Hannah&#39;s older sister was completely miserable in school - she missed her family every day from grades 1-3, longed for more time and a slower pace to life. Hannah was happy in school. She missed us at times but is highly social and loved her friends. When I told her that her older sister had decided to homeschool, she told us that she didn&#39;t want to go to school because now her big sister wouldn&#39;t be there anymore. We honoured her desire to also try homeschooling and happily transitioned into a life without school after completing grade one. We had a joyful three years. They have lots of friends who also don&#39;t go to school and are happily engaged in lots of homeschooling activities of their choosing. Hannah also maintained a close friend from school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year has had it&#39;s share of challenges. We had a very difficult fall. Hannah started acting out for a while and to make a long story short, she slowly began to disclose to us that she had been engaging in sex play with a neighbour friend of the same age over the past year...which wouldn&#39;t have been a problem except that she had grown quite unhappy with the situation but did not feel able to tell this to the friend at the time and so the play continued for way too long as far as her comfort level was concerned. She had some very difficult emotions to sort through...she felt ashamed, didn&#39;t like herself, felt confused about sex, longed to feel &quot;little&quot; again. She is a very resilient child and so was able to feel better after about two months of talking a lot and sorting things through. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, her older sister had a traumatic situation happen where she was bit by a dog while babysitting and then we had to take her to emerg. because the dog&#39;s shots weren&#39;t up to date...and while we were there the doctors inadvertently noticed that she could have a possible heart problem which required about two months of testing before everything was cleared and she was declared healthy again. She has struggled all year with anxiety issues and is finally starting to come out of it and begin to feel better. I have had to spend a lot of time helping her to heal while Hannah did not have as much time with me. During Hannah&#39;s difficult time however, the tables were turned and it was her older sister who had less Mommy time. I talked to them about how this sometimes happens when a person is going through a hard time and that all people have times when they need special attention. They seemed to understand well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs they were both struggling this fall, I found the thing that helped the most (through a lot of trial and error) was to have a lot of predictability and structure in our lives. They seemed to benefit from being told &quot;and this is what we are doing next...and then this...and now it is time for bed&quot; etc. Our routines also included a fair bit of &quot;bookwork&quot; which was quite a departure from our happy unschooling life. But it seemed to calm them at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHannah has also talked a fair bit about being bored this year. Her older sister is an introvert who doesn&#39;t like to go too quickly through life or to fill up her schedule too much. Hannah, on the other hand, loves to be with people all the time and to have a busy, fun, very full life. I have done my best to meet both their needs and to talk about how in our family we work to find space for everyone&#39;s desires. I admit to feeling that they both feel shortchanged on a regular enough basis because they are so very different. They do love one another and have a good relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have given a lot of different information in the hopes that this can give a picture of where we are. I don&#39;t feel congruent about her going back to school because of the year we have had. If we hadn&#39;t had these extra challenges, I would have felt confident that Hannah was freely choosing to check out school. This may still be the case...but overall I feel insecure about why this is happening. Any feedback would be MUCH appreciated! And...I have NEVER sent such a long post! If you have read to the end...thank you! <br/>\n<br/>\nKirsten</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67522,"nextTopicId":67272}}
