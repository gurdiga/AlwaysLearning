Walking the aisles has always been an important distraction. Most people smile. Depending on who you are flying with, your children may be entertained by the crew. Singapore airlines have been incredibly child friendly. Nursing helps. Having food that they will eat is important, the child meals aren&#39;t specific to your child&#39;s taste. Get things that are new to you children to unwrap on the plane, and do wrap them in gift wrap. Little puzzles, coloring books, books, etc..over pack your carry ons. If you don&#39;t use what you brought, fine, but if there is something in there that you put in on a whim that holds either of your kid rapt for 15 minutes, that is so good. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe layover is important. Go into shops, explore wander, run, play games, play tag. If you are going via Singapore, look for cool costumes, if you are going by Dubai, I bet their airport is good, via Japan, that would be fun too, Kuala Lumpur, really fun. I&#39;ve only ever gone through Singapore. But I can imagine that the other layovers would have heaps of entertainment. Singapore has a fish pond in the middle that&#39;s fun to wander through and gaze into, tossing coins in and talking about what you might have wished for. Spend money during the layover. Try and be as relaxed as you can be. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: claire.horsley08 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:claire.horsley08@...\">claire.horsley08@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 21 February, 2009 11:32:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I get to go to England!<br/>\n<br/>\nFantastic Sandra!

Keith&#39;s a sweetie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s something, though, because when I built up courage for the speech  <br/>\nto ask Keith if I could go to England for the conference there on July  <br/>\n25, he said yes!<br/>\nAnd when I asked my friend Helene McNeill if she might go with me, as  <br/>\nshe lived there a long time and is brave in London, she said &quot;YES!&quot;   <br/>\nExcept, she said, if she goes, she needs to visit her aunt in Paris.<br/>\n<br/>\nShucks!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;ll get to go to Schuyler&#39;s house!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWoohooo!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were a kid I would get on my bike and ride, ride, ride, but I&#39;m  <br/>\nkinda old.  I think I&#39;ll go and talk to Keith, work in the yard, walk  <br/>\nto the store, get the adrenaline out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAND the conference organizer says I can speak there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42425,"nextTopicId":42072}}
