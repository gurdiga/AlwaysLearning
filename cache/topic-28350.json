She has a hand full of obvious <br/>\ndifferences, mostly hormone and growth related. She also has a handful of <br/>\ndiagnosis that the Dr.&#39;s would love to saddle her with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hesitate to do anything more or less with her than my other children, <br/>\naside from obvious care taking stuff. I also wonder what I might have burned <br/>\nin my brain from society that is norm or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was 6 when diagnosed and is 13 now. I have just now started to see some <br/>\npronounced differences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny helpful hints?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace.<br/>\nWildflower<br/>\n<br/>\n21 years in the unschooling world and still so much to learn!<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\ni&#39;m making a difference.ï¿½Make every IM count for the cause of your choice. <br/>\nJoin Now. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0080000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtagline\">http://clk.atdmt.com/MSN/go/msnnkwme0080000001msn/direct/01/?href=http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=hmtagline</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28341,"nextTopicId":28325}}
