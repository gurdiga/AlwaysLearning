Would that be typical?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing we talk about a lot here is manipulative behavior.  Girls usually say to my daughters &quot;I won&#39;t be your friend if you don&#39;t .......&quot;  Or they will cry to make my daughters feel sorry and let them have their way.  We have gotten so calloused to this type of thing it has become a joke in our house.  I know it sounds cruel but my daughters will not be victims of manipulative behavior.  They tell their friends how they feel and they are direct in their communications.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a> <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Saturday, February 09, 2002 12:18 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 217<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 02/08/2002 11:26:13 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt;This drives me crazy.
