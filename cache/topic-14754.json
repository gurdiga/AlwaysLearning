A <br/>\nperson&#39;s name is such a huge part of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy girls like names like Crystal Star, Cinderella Rose, Crystal Diamond, <br/>\nButtercup, Pansy, Snowdrop, Diamond, and Snowflake.  Anything that could <br/>\nbe in a fairy tale, is great.   And lately they pick Leiren, too, in <br/>\nhonor of their baby sister.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always loved names.  I have many name books.  For my girls I went <br/>\nthrough a whole naming process, which gets harder all the time.  The <br/>\nfirst name must be different, but feminine with a strong meaning that&#39;s <br/>\na noun.  The middle name must be of the same language or ethnicity and <br/>\nmore usual, must start with a &quot;k&quot; sound to flow with our last name, <br/>\nCase, and it&#39;s meaning must be an adjective for the first name&#39;s noun. <br/>\n So far I have:   Irish Gaelic - Aislinn Kathleen (a pure vision or <br/>\ndream), Greek - Elysia Khloe (a blooming heaven, or a growing <br/>\nhappiness), French - Soleille Claire ( bright sunshine), and <br/>\nScandinavian - Leiren Cari (beloved of the earth).    If I have another <br/>\ngirl next, I&#39;m thinking about Latin - Quinn (queen, fifth).  The only <br/>\nproblem is a middle name with a &quot;k&quot; sound is too many &quot;k&quot; sounds.  Oh <br/>\nwell.  Leiren is only six months, so I guess I&#39;ve got some time to <br/>\nfigure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always done the &quot;how will it sound if I&#39;m calling her at the park&quot; <br/>\ntest.  My husband liked the name Sijana or something like that, but for <br/>\nthe life of me, I just couldn&#39;t imagine calling that out at the park! <br/>\n He just liked it because it meant to harvest (he&#39;s a farmer).<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;ve rambled way too long.  I just love comming up with names! <br/>\n Good luck.  And by the way Sandra, no matter what she eventually <br/>\nsettles on, just smile even if you hate it.

I&#39;ve told him that if he ever had <br/>\n&gt; kids <br/>\n&gt; that his partner should be in charge of names.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>OH! I&#39;m afraid to let Duncan name animals. They get horrid names like (These <br/>\nare some stuffed animal names) Sharkey, Snakey, Freddie, Brownie.  I get the <br/>\nheebie-jeebies just calling out their names!<br/>\n<br/>\nCameron, on the other hand, has named several of our animals: We&#39;ve had <br/>\nBeeper (Electronic Page was her registered name), SodaPop, Tornado, Rosie,  Ali & <br/>\nDina (two hamsters, short for &quot;ALl&quot;igator and &quot;DINA&quot;saur), and my favorite, <br/>\nChase (short for Skirtchaser). His old, stuffed bunny is Charlotte, and he named <br/>\nDuncan&#39;s stuffed kitty, Matilda (Tilly).<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE names and hate to see the same ones over and over. I&#39;m usually bored <br/>\nto tears with dogs&#39; names (Sam, Bear, Ben, Schatzi, etc.). But I LOVE horse <br/>\nnames! Some of those guys are SOOO creative.
