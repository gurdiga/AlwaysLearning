The last week I have sat down with <br/>\nmy 3 boys multiple times a day to watch the same video of bear in the <br/>\nbig blue house. I picked an easy knitting project that kept me from <br/>\ngoing insane and just spend time with them.<br/>\nGoogle teacherese (think thats the word) and see how everyday activities <br/>\nget turned into educational stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most importantly let him be!! give him the opertunity to find <br/>\nhimself and support him in that. Do interesting things yourself and if <br/>\nit interests him he will join you.<br/>\nRedefine your definition of nothing, playing a game is not nothing, <br/>\nchatting on facebook is not nothing.<br/>\nIt is important to move your mind from schooling to unschooling read <br/>\nsandras site (www.sandradodd.com/unschooling) find unschooling podcasts <br/>\nand online groups that hel inspire you to inspire your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas it his choice btw to leave school?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been out of school for 10 years and I am still deschooling <br/>\nmyself, especially since having kids I notice more and more how school <br/>\nis imgrained almost in my brain<br/>\nVera<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nluvthesoap wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This week is the first week on unschooling.
