The richness of the ongoing discussion of  <br/>\nunschooling is my reason for maintaining and participating on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friend Jon Tsosie had a job on a crew building solar houses for a  <br/>\nresearch project in the 1970&#39;s.  At Ghost Ranch, they built several  <br/>\nhouses that were similar and had somewhat different solar collection  <br/>\narrangements.  Then they were measuring and proving this&#39;n&#39;that,  <br/>\nlater on.  He learned a lot.  He was being paid to work on those  <br/>\nhouses.  Other people would come by and pay money to learn about  <br/>\nsolar heating, and they would work on the houses too, for a while (I  <br/>\nguess there were workshops periodically).  So the purpose of the  <br/>\nexistence of those houses was...  Well, people were going to live in  <br/>\nthem.  But there was some kind of grant money paid for the results of  <br/>\nthe scientific comparisons.  And they were being used as educational  <br/>\ndemonstrations too, of solar-collection construction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne project can serve many purposes.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t mean that one project can serve ALL purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38919,"nextTopicId":38970}}
