The idea that there even *was* a &quot;natural&quot; state of humans was a shocking idea, and went against culture and religion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most obvious and photographable expression of doing what was natural was hair.  I was stylin&#39; in those days because I have very straight hair that grows a little past my waist, and that was cool.  But whatever kind of hair people had, they let it grow and let it be--curly, kinky, wavy, fluffy--and women stopped shaving so much and plucking so much, to see what hair did naturally grow on them, and where.  And men stopped (or tried to stop) posturing so much, and thought about what they would actually like to do, or wear, or listen to, or live around, if they weren&#39;t constrained by &quot;manliness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was in response to buzz cuts for men, and curlers worn all night every single night by women.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people argued that things people had made were not natural, though, I would ask them if they thought honey was natural; bees&#39; nests; beaver dams.   We didn&#39;t know yet then about chimps&#39; tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had nothing against human artifact.  Firing pottery doesn&#39;t bother me a bit.  I sure didn&#39;t want to give up my guitar, which was likely to have at any one moment treated wood from at least two continents, steel, brass, plastic, and mother-of-pearl.  I had no interest in abandoning the 1958 VW Bug I was using to get the 90 miles from the university to where my parents and sister were, on weekends; they had just divorced and my sister was going back and forth, and not happy in either place.   &quot;Natural&quot; wasn&#39;t going to cut a 90 mile commute.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as time has moved on, I don&#39;t consider a MacBook Pro with internet to be unnatural, any more than a bird&#39;s nest in my yard containing hair from dogs that were originally bred in Australia.

I also have a now 16 year old son who started at our local vocational college in August this year after nine years out of school during which time he mostly played videogames (incidentally, he&#39;s doing well at college and enjoying the experience).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am occasionally asked how it is that I changed my mind about my children&#39;s education so radically, and the fact is I didn&#39;t. &quot;Education&quot; and &quot;school&quot; are not the same thing and never have been.  I&#39;ve been aware of the negative aspects of school since I was at school myself in the 1950s and 60s.  In those days, you were generally expected to tolerate the negatives for a higher purpose, even if it was one that was imposed on us rather than actually chosen (but at the same time we probably did understand why).  My mother, who grew up in rural England in the 1920s, walked three miles to school and three miles home again in all weathers for the privilege of being taught what she wouldn&#39;t otherwise have learned and that helped her to escape life on the farm for something better.  Even in the 1990s, when my daughter was progressing through the school system, accommodating its less than appealing characteristics in return for a &#39;good education&#39; was still a viable option and that&#39;s the one my wife and I chose, though it required a huge amount of attention and energy to be involved in and to watch over our daughter&#39;s school experience, and true enough it was frequently necessary to counteract some effects of &#39;What Schools Want&#39; with what we preferred when our daughter was outside her school&#39;s jurisdiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been aware that very little of what I learned myself at school has been of genuine use to me in my adult life, and that nearly all of what has been genuinely useful to me has been acquired since I decided to take responsibility for my own education when I was in my late 20s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read John Holt&#39;s &quot;How Children Learn&quot; and &quot;How Children Fail&quot; a long time ago, a few years after I left school, but the person who persuaded me to accept my son&#39;s request to be removed from school was not John Holt but Tim Berners-Lee.  We&#39;d had the internet at home for two years by then and I could plainly see that my son was learning more in half an hour on the internet than he was being taught in a whole day at school.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wife and I value our children&#39;s happiness above other considerations and the fact is, our daughter was happy at school (so I know it&#39;s possible) and our son was unhappy at school and that was the difference that has resulted in them growing to adulthood along such contrasting paths.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderlying the desire for our children to be happy is what I think of as &quot;maximum&quot; freedom to choose for themselves how they live their lives.  Before our daughter started school, maximum freedom meant a great deal of freedom for her to follow her preferences and of course it does tend to make people happy when they can do that; when our daughter was in school, however, the &quot;maximum&quot; shrank somewhat (that was the deal, so to speak, in return for a &#39;good education&#39; and overall that worked out okay), whenever she was outside of her school&#39;s jurisdiction during that time her maximum freedom expanded again, often to previous dimensions.  Before our son started school, there was an early phase when both my wife and I were in full-time paid employment, there was a phase when we moved home several times, and our son&#39;s maximum freedom varied a lot; in the nine years he was out of school, it was possibly as close to total freedom as we could ever get when he was at home, but when we were out and about it was less, and he had virtually no freedom in the earlier years in particular to be out and about on his own during &quot;school hours&quot;.  So &quot;maximum freedom&quot; has always meant different things at different times and in different places.  But whatever it was, maximum freedom was what my wife and I were constantly trying to create for our children within the reality of living in society and living our own lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this is the point I&#39;m trying to make: I&#39;m still working on my understanding of the concept of &quot;unschooling&quot;, and maybe I&#39;ll get there one day, but I get the impression sometimes now when I read what some people have to say about it that they think of it as a kind of alternative reality where anything associated with school is an unwelcome intrusion, and I really feel that&#39;s a mistake.  My nine years sharing the adventure with my son were wonderful and it&#39;s true that we liked being homebodies and we were very discerning about who we did or didn&#39;t engage with, but at no time was it ever like living in a cabin in the woods ignoring the world at large.  I do think there is a Big Picture to step back and look at so that my thinking is at a higher level than simply seeing the experience as &quot;going to school vs. not going to school&quot;, but at the same time the everyday reality was that the desire for happiness and freedom (and success, however that might be defined) needed to function in a context of how society operates with regard to that issue and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to change for me.  I&#39;ve been a non-mainstream parent from the beginning and yes that&#39;s a narrow path at times but it&#39;s still a path that runs through normal everyday society.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my abiding memories, by the way, from when my son was first out of school was of him sitting on the sofa in front of the TV playing his latest videogame while his sister was sitting next to him working on her latest university assignment, and there was no indication from either of them that they thought this was anything other than perfectly natural.  I remember watching and wondering at that and it really did get me thinking about what&#39;s important and what isn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, that&#39;s turned out to be a bit of a ramble.

Kids really don&#39;t need to know mom&#39;s feelings about Barney or Barbies or rap music.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that doesn&#39;t mean lying. It means being aware and sensitive that mom&#39;s words can carry a lot of emotion weight.
