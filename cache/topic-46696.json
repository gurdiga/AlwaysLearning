I see it as more of showing support and respect in a child&#39;s interest yet redirecting them into something safer knowing a situation is potential dangerous versus allowing them to just remain in those type of situations like the mom i mentioned previously who&#39;s toddler was on the riverside ledge. Not being dramatic and panicky is a great thing...but man oh man...I&#39;m not all about letting my young child be in danger and not doing a thing about it whatsoever, just allowing them to stay there as long as they wish.
