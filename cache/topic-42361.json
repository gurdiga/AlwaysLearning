I am a mom of 4 <br/>\nand grandma of 2 living in a tiny town of the beautiful Upper Peninsula <br/>\nof Michigan. 2 of my 4 children are adults and went to public schools. <br/>\nI started homeschooling my 2 youngest children, now 10 and 7 since they <br/>\nwere of kindergarten age. All last school year I read up, tried to <br/>\ngrasp the concept, researched and debated whether I wanted to try <br/>\nunschooling. Then this year around December I decided to take the leap <br/>\ncompletely over to it. So I am fairly new to the concept and trying to <br/>\nmake the adjustments while Hubby is not so sure at all as he does not <br/>\nunderstand it. I love the concept of unschooling as it makes so much <br/>\nsense to me and seems so natural to how I have always lived my life and <br/>\nhow I have always learned. I am glad to be part of this group and being <br/>\nable to read all the topics, it really is a big help! Hope to get to <br/>\nknow everyone here!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":42351,"nextTopicId":42385}}
