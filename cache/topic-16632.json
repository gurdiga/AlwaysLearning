When we lived there a couple of years ago I didn&#39;t<br/>\nregister either - I could have claimed we were still California<br/>\nresidents, but I didn&#39;t file my private school R-4 here either, so I<br/>\nguess I was just illegal. Nothing happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a single mom, though, with a periodically irate FOB, I think I&#39;m in a<br/>\nslightly more precarious situation than most folks. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think enforcement  would vary by state, and even by city within the<br/>\nstate, so maybe your local folks would be better able to tell you if<br/>\nanyone has actually been &quot;caught&quot;, and what the penalty would be. If it<br/>\nwas like Arizona - $50 fine - I&#39;d blow it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] To Register or Not to Register","postDate":"1066074878","msgId":16632,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMxMDEzMTk1NDM4LjQ3OTA5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNjYwMzE0NTMuMTA4Ni40MDQyMy5tMTJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":16633,"prevInTime":16631,"nextInTime":16633,"topicId":16632,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"OK all you radicals, inquiring minds want to know.
