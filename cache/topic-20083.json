Yes, you might need to choose to go back to work <br/>\nor might choose not to use all your retirement money, etc. But we <br/>\nalways have choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren however, do not always have choices in our culture because <br/>\nwe obstruct their liberties by using coercion. No one is obstructing <br/>\nyour liberties, except the tax man and the law, as Sandra pointed <br/>\nout. Children&#39;s choices are often unheard or not advocated for. <br/>\nKnowingly &quot;making them&quot; do something they don&#39;t want to do is <br/>\ncoercion.  Someone wins and someone loses. Explaining why you want <br/>\nsomething and then they change their mind to wanting to do it is <br/>\nusing persuasion. Discussiing ways to each get what you want is <br/>\nnegotiating for a win-win solution. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe use of rewards and punishments to persuade is manipulation, just <br/>\nanother tool of coercion. Making something enjoyable so that you both <br/>\nwant to do it is an art. It takes practice and trial and error. do <br/>\nnot expect yourself to know how to come to common preferences without <br/>\npractice. Do not expect to be able to do it perfectly all the time. <br/>\nCommon preferences do exist but can not always be found immediately. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut next time we can be more creative based on our experience. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t believe a pattern of coercion exists with isolated coercive <br/>\nevents. But I do appologize when I can not find a common preference. <br/>\nI acknowledge that it isn&#39;t the way that I want to interact and I <br/>\nwill work VERY hard not to have a pattern created. If a problem <br/>\nrepeats itself, it requires work to resolve. It is not easy. <br/>\nConsensual living is its own reward. Liberty for all is worth working <br/>\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPat<br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Kay Alina&quot; &lt;angelsguard@s...&gt; <br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;She said there are times people have to things <br/>\n&gt; &gt; they don&#39;t want to. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t see the difference.
