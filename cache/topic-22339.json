In the case of negative punishment, when a rider puts <br/>\npressure on, say, the horse&#39;s side with her leg, that&#39;s &quot;Positive <br/>\npunishment&quot;; when the horse moves away from the pressure in the <br/>\ndirection the rider wants to go, the rider releases the pressure, i.e., <br/>\nnegates it (Negative Punishment).  A horse and rider can also be <br/>\ntrained to use a release in the direction of travel instead of pressure <br/>\nfrom the opposite side, but it&#39;s the combination which is most <br/>\neffective.<br/>\n<br/>\nNegative means &quot;off,&quot; and Positive means &quot;on.&quot;  Not &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nNegative Reinforcement means &quot;no reward.&quot;  The animal is free to try <br/>\nagain; the interplay of positive and negative reward is the basis of <br/>\nshaping behaviors.  Example:  I have a horse who is terrified of <br/>\nplastic grocery bags.  I&#39;ve been using operant conditioning (aka <br/>\nclicker training) to get her to, of her own volition, touch a bag on <br/>\nthe ground with her nose.  (She already knows the &quot;Touch&quot; game with <br/>\nless scary objects.)  She is free to not touch, to leave the area, to <br/>\nend the game.  She may choose No Reward.  If she looks at the bag, <br/>\nshe&#39;s rewarded.  If she takes a step in its direction, she&#39;s rewarded.  <br/>\nGradually, she moves closer.  Once she is close enough to touch it, <br/>\neach attempt is rewarded, until she actually bumps it.  Then, she&#39;s <br/>\ngiven a &quot;jackpot&quot; (remind you of anything?), a huge handful of treats, <br/>\na pat, and verbal praise.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game doesn&#39;t stop with the first touch, though ;-)  Now, I want to <br/>\nincrease the criteria, as my goal is for her to accept the presence of <br/>\nplastic bags in all settings; one of those blowing across a trail can <br/>\nmake for a wild ride!  So, she touches the bag, which is wrapped around <br/>\na rock; then, I pull a bit of bag loose, so it&#39;s moving in the wind.  <br/>\nHorse touches that.  Eventually, she&#39;s pushing it a bit with her nose.  <br/>\nI up the ante; she has to push it, not merely touch, to get rewarded.  <br/>\nNegative reinforcement -- no reward -- encourages her to try again, try <br/>\nsomething different.  In a few weeks, I hope to have her picking up <br/>\nempty plastic bags with her teeth &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a new twist in the clicker training world called &quot;Tag <br/>\nTeaching,&quot; in which the human subject is in on the goal.  Instead of <br/>\nusing a clicker to shape an animal&#39;s behavior, the click is used to <br/>\ntell the human they&#39;ve done the behavior correctly.  For example, a <br/>\ndance teacher can use the sound to let the student know a position is <br/>\nexactly correct, or a diving coach can mark the correct position for a <br/>\nquickly moving student.  I&#39;ve used the technique myself with a <br/>\nhorseback riding student.  The reward, for a human student who wants to <br/>\nlearn, is the click itself.  For an animal, a click must be followed by <br/>\na reinforcer/reward of some kind, or they&#39;ll lose interest in the game; <br/>\nyou have to play by the rules.  (In Negative Reinforcement, the click <br/>\nis withheld; one never clicks without following with a treat.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with applying operant conditioning techniques to humans is <br/>\nthey are too smart: they see through the game, weigh the value of the <br/>\nreward against the effort required to gain it, and opt out if the <br/>\nreward doesn&#39;t measure up.  If you don&#39;t offer a reward for reading, <br/>\nreading itself will be reward enough.  Put a reward in place, and the <br/>\nchild either strives to get through the reading to get it, or decides <br/>\nit&#39;s not worth the effort.  In the end, it&#39;s reading that loses -- <br/>\nlogically, a book must be less valuable than other things (TV?  Video <br/>\ngames?) if a bribe must be offered to get one to read.  (FYI -- like <br/>\npunishment being something bad that follows a behavior to try to <br/>\ndiscourage recurrence, a bribe is something that precedes a behavior to <br/>\ntry to encourage it to occur.  In operant conditioning, the reward <br/>\nfollows the behavior, which is initiated by the subject/animal.  From <br/>\nthe animal&#39;s point of view, it&#39;s training you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely love clicker training animals -- it provides a language <br/>\nunique to both participants, and both enjoy the experience.  I don&#39;t <br/>\nhave to train my horse to eat grass, or roll in soft sand, or kick up <br/>\nher heels.  I do have to train her to get in a trailer, or to stand <br/>\nstill while I get on, or to not spook at plastic bags; I can use a <br/>\ncompletely benign, friendly (positive ;-) method to gain her <br/>\ncooperation for my goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n(sorry to run on like that -- you hit on one of my favorite subjects!  <br/>\nTalk about gardening for awhile, and I&#39;ll shut up ;-)<br/>\nNancy<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] spoiled/supply/conditioning (was Summer reading program)","postDate":"1118680663","msgId":22370,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFmNjQ2Y2FjYWQzMjllMjJhMWQzNDUwZGM4NDZlZTFhQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNzIwMWM1NzAyNyRlYWJjYmJjMCQ3MWEyODdkOUBwYXJhZG94Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDllLjI4MDdmODg1LjJmZGVlMmQwQGFvbC5jb20+IDwwMDZiMDFjNTcwMjckMDNhZDQ2NTAkMDIwMGE4YzBAeW91cm8wa3drdzlqd2M+IDwwMDcyMDFjNTcwMjckZWFiY2JiYzAkNzFhMjg3ZDlAcGFyYWRveD4="},"prevInTopic":22363,"nextInTopic":22378,"prevInTime":22369,"nextInTime":22371,"topicId":22339,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"People learn to buckle their seat belt to avoid the annoying sound of the buzzer in their car.

If you starved someone almost their whole<br/>\nattention/focus will be on getting food. You can get them to do things for<br/>\nfood but don&#39;t expect much intelligence or creativity. Which is why you<br/>\nshouldn&#39;t go food shopping when you&#39;re hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you gave them an adequate diet and gave food &#39;treats&#39; as a reward. Then<br/>\nintelligence/creativity will shoot up.<br/>\nLaboratory rats when used for intelligence/mental testing are kept hungry<br/>\nand interested in food but they&#39;re fed an adequate diet.<br/>\nBecause you are reinforcing a behaviour/reward response you don&#39;t want to<br/>\nreinforce or focus on bad habits.<br/>\nEating a ton of sweets as a reward for dieting is reinforcing eating sweets<br/>\nrather than dieting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this really only applies to behaviours that you want to limit or<br/>\nencourage, if something is completely unacceptable, then we&#39;re into a<br/>\ndifferent area. I think they use electric shocks with rats and mice, I don&#39;t<br/>\nthink that&#39;s acceptable with children !<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most effective kind of conditioning is &#39;random reward&#39; where the reward<br/>\nis not guaranteed, but is based on random chance with the reward becoming<br/>\nless and less likely over time or the behaviour needed to get it becoming<br/>\nmore difficult (but still with a random element) , and the desired behaviour<br/>\nincreasing proportionately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact you could regard the whole of adult life as a &#39;random reward&#39; system<br/>\n(I think I feel a book coming on).<br/>\n<br/>\nChris </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"spoiled/supply/conditioning (was Summer reading program)","postDate":"1118594403","msgId":22339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxNC4yYWM1OWRlLjJmZGRiZjYzQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22345,"prevInTime":22338,"nextInTime":22340,"topicId":22339,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 6/12/2005 9:57:48 AM Mountain Daylight Time, ecsamhill@earthlink.net writes: Oh, and  I believe that when doing animal conditioning for a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-250270878\">In a message dated 6/12/2005 9:57:48 AM Mountain Daylight Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ecsamhill@...\">ecsamhill@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and  I believe that when doing animal conditioning for a reward the whole <br/>\nthing  only works if the animals are underfed.

We <br/>\n&quot;proved&quot; things with really hungry rats and people applied the  principles to <br/>\nhuman children who didn&#39;t live in cages.<br/>\n <br/>\nAll that operant conditioning is out of style now in psych studies.
