Given my extreme emotional<br/>\nstate, she told me to drink a glass of wine &quot;right now&quot; and have a<br/>\nglass every night if I needed to. It couldn&#39;t hurt the baby at that<br/>\npoint and my emotional state was more harmful anyway. I didn&#39;t drink<br/>\nevery night, but for a couple of days it felt like it saved my life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis birth was really wonderful, and I have to think the wine did quite<br/>\na bit to help.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nlearninginfreedom.com</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26900,"nextTopicId":26902}}
