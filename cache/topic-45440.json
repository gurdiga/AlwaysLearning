I think you are over thinking things if you are worried about protein. It is very unlikely she is &quot;not getting enough protein.&quot; What you need to worry about is vitamin B12. Is she taking a multi-vitamin? If she&#39;s not I would suggest she take a vegetarian multi-vitamin.<br/>\n<br/>\n*We go shopping every week at Whole Foods and she stocks up on a variety of foods, and I always remind her to get the protein-rich foods.* <br/>\n<br/>\nI would go far as to say you don&#39;t need to do this. Why are you constantly reminding her? Why are you constantly questioning her throughout the day? <br/>\n<br/>\n* Unfortunately she hates tofu, even disguised, and soy milk. While I see what we buy every week, I don&#39;t monitor what she eats and when she eats it.*<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t need to eat tofu or drink soy milk to be a healthy vegan. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your daughter is not eating enough, in general. Do you have reason to be concerned about an eating disorder? If you say she eats a variety of foods and is generally healthy. So, it sounds like that is not the issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have often read articles about &quot;vegans&quot; dying or parents who are vegan and their infants die because of their vegan diet. However...usually upon closer inspection I find myself screaming &quot;they weren&#39;t vegan!&quot; I remember  reading a specific article about a family who&#39;s infant had died. It was blamed on the strict vegan diet of the parents. But also in the article it said the parents only fed the infant apple juice and soy milk! That&#39;s not vegan (well it is) but that most certainly would not be what is considered a &quot;vegan diet&quot; that is only feeding a kid apple juice and soy milk. It would be the equivalent of saying &quot;child dies from meat diet&quot; if you fed the baby only a teaspoon of meat a day. That particular child died of starvation. <br/>\n<br/>\nOkay...I guess the rant was to reassure you that your daughter is probably fine. I would make sure she is taking a supplement for the B12. Don&#39;t over think things on this and I would really try backing off her a bit. You say you don&#39;t monitor her but if you are constantly asking her about it...you really are. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave you explored the reasons your daughter has gone vegan? <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKelly Halldorson<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Vegan Teenager","postDate":"1242967299","msgId":45445,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyMzMxLjY1MTQ2LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEYwMzEyQ0E0MTBGRDRDMEI4MTJCN0U2OUY3MjgxRDVFQFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PGd2NTQxZCs5YjhtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RjAzMTJDQTQxMEZENEMwQjgxMkI3RTY5RjcyODFENUVAUm9ieW5QQz4="},"prevInTopic":45444,"nextInTopic":45448,"prevInTime":45444,"nextInTime":45446,"topicId":45440,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Beans are full of protein.

I used to do this for myself after a trip to the bulk section (putting a serving size into baggies and taking one w/ me each day to work for a morning snack.)  I find, esp. when I&#39;m on the run, that if I *don&#39;t* pack some sort of food that is easily and readily accessible, I am likely to ignore my hunger until I feel faint, leading to me usually binging on the first edible and easy to reach food I find (like a bag of chips, etc.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe check out the work of Dr. Joel Fuhrman to learn more about vegan nutrition.  I&#39;ve heard his book &quot;DiseaseProof Your Child&quot; recommended in many a vegan discussion on various food lists for ideas of how to ensure vegan children get all the nutrients/vitamins/etc. they need.  He has a website as well w/ articles and more... <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.drfuhrman.com/default.aspx\">http://www.drfuhrman.com/default.aspx</a>  Perhaps there you might find more ideas of high-energy/nutrient-rich vegan foods to prepare for her when she&#39;s on the go?
