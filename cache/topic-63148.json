Keith and Marty came through and chatted a bit, but the meal and a long game of Five Crowns with a fair amount of chit chat was me, Holly, and those four of her boyfriend&#39;s family.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose boys are well accomplished, school kids but with jobs and hobbies and artistic projects, all of them.  The middle one does stand-up comedy and goes to college.  But the person at the table who was the best at adding scores and figuring out at a glance how someone could rearrange cards to make a better score was Holly, no question.  The middle of the three was sitting next to me.  The two of us were taking turns losing, which meant we had to add up a handful of cards at face value (not easy all 5&#39;s and 10&#39;s, like rummy, but face value with Jacks 11, Queens 12 and Kings 13).   I can do it, but self-consciously.  Tom the brother had a very hard time.  Nobody razzed him about it at all, and Will (Holly&#39;s guy) was the scorekeeper and would help him but I was aware of that because I&#39;m nervous about how they will see Holly.  (No problem.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe banter was all happily joyful and clever.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of times Holly didn&#39;t know what something meant and would say so, without self-consciousness.

She was telling this kid that he should focus on being who he is rather than being who he is not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a valuable skill, focusing on what you have and who you are, rather than what you don&#39;t have and who you aren&#39;t.  Marty seems to have that.  A lot of unschooled kids seem to have that.  I see it in my kids too.  Marty has the freedom to take an Eastern Religions class and the freedom to share what he writes in that class with his mother.  He gave a little glimpse of himself in that writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never trade that for all the forced classics and essays in all the world!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Nature or nurture?

He write a response paper on the Bhagavad-Gita, relating his own thoughts to three passages of his choice.  He got an 83% (just for the record; the teacher wanted one section to have been longer).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were lots of comments, but one was &quot;I liked the authenticity of your response, and I think you have a gift for putting these concepts in simple terms that are easy to relate to.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it&#39;s partly that he&#39;s been around philosophy discussions all his life (SCA-related--virtues, chivalry; alternative education; parenting).  Maybe it&#39;s partly that he&#39;s the biological product of two adults who have friends and visitors who talk about those things.   It&#39;s hard to say, really, but the combination of the two together has created a young adult who will take an Eastern Religions class out of curiosity, who isn&#39;t intimidated by the reading or the request that he relate his own thoughts and experiences in relation to them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s part of what Marty wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The Bhagavad-Gita speaks of meditation as a way to Moksha, or enlightenment.  Meditation is something that is fairly common i my life, not as a prayer but as a practical form of self control.  My mother tells me all the time &quot;take three deep breaths,&quot; when I&#39;m excited, angry, scared, sad, or any number of other things that might cause me to be out of focus.  When I do stop and take a second to breathe, I feel my heart slow, my muscles relax, and my mind clear.  And when I turn my mind back to the task, I always get results that I am more comfortable with.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n=====<br/>\nI cringe at the &quot;self control&quot; phrase, but hey...

He did take a non-required reading/rhetoric class, but he&#39;s interested in the mechanics of writing.   I recommended that he write on video games sites for practice.
