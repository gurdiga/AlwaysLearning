It&#39;s fatalistic because it says<br/>\nthat the first few years of life set the course for the person&#39;s<br/>\nentire existence, which I think is false. I personally find the<br/>\nalternative comforting: the first few years don&#39;t put you on trolley<br/>\ntracks that you travel the rest of your life. The child-moulding<br/>\ntheory has also led, ironically, to a perverse view of child rearing.<br/>\nJudith Rich Harris is coming out with a book called The Nurture<br/>\nAssumption which argues that parents don&#39;t influence the long-term<br/>\nfates of their children; peers do. The reaction she often gets is, &quot;So<br/>\nare you saying it doesn&#39;t matter how I treat my child?&quot; She points out<br/>\nthat this is like someone learning that you can&#39;t change the<br/>\npersonality of your spouse and asking, &quot;So are you saying that it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t matter how you treat my spouse?&quot; People seem to think that the<br/>\nonly reason to be nice to children is that it will mold their<br/>\ncharacter as adults in the future -- as opposed to the common-sense<br/>\nidea that you should be nice to people because it makes life better<br/>\nfor them in the present. Child rearing has become a technological<br/>\nmatter of which practices grow the best children, as opposed to a<br/>\nhuman relationship in which the happiness of the child (during<br/>\nchildhood) is determined by how the child is treated. She has a<br/>\nwonderful quote: &quot;We may not control our children&#39;s tomorrows, but we<br/>\nsurely control their todays, and we have the capacity to make them<br/>\nvery, very miserable.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(the whole thing is here:)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/darwin/evolutionist/pinker.htm\">http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/darwin/evolutionist/pinker.htm</a><br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBea<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Bea&quot; &lt;bmantovani@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This might be old news to many of you, but I just discovered it and am<br/>\n&gt; so excited I want to share, I hope it&#39;s okay:<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":130027733,"authorName":"Bea","from":"&quot;Bea&quot; &lt;bmantovani@...&gt;","profile":"bmantovani","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"The decline of violenceSteven Pinker","postDate":"1209657177","msgId":34599,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ2Y3AwcCt2cGQwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34600,"prevInTime":34598,"nextInTime":34600,"topicId":34599,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This might be old news to many of you, but I just discovered it and am so excited I want to share, I hope it s okay:","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-403957299\">This might be old news to many of you, but I just discovered it and am<br/>\nso excited I want to share, I hope it&#39;s okay:</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34516,"nextTopicId":34571}}
