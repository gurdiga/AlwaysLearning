When I think directions, I<br/>\nthink the vast numbers of sheets with text translated from Korean, often<br/>\npoorly, with 500 little pieces and drawings - like for putting together<br/>\nfurniture.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve always liked strategy guides - often getting them at the same time we<br/>\nbuy the game (which comes after renting the game and finding it is the one<br/>\nin ten we&#39;ll really enjoy).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guides are full of &quot;clues&quot; and &quot;research info&quot;.  We like that.  For the<br/>\ngame we&#39;ve been playing with for the past couple months (ace combat 04)<br/>\nNathan and I have the strategy guide pretty well memorized.  (Now, we could<br/>\nwrite some additional chapters.)  The directions are at a more general<br/>\nlevel and based on features of the challenge. And the statistics for all the<br/>\nplanes and targets are there. Yummy...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about &quot;cheat codes&quot;?  I think when it comes to video games, if<br/>\ncheat codes help you reach the goal - which really is to have fun - by<br/>\nchanging the rules enough to match your skills to the game play level (thus<br/>\npromoting flow), then they&#39;re cool. Once we have progressed in our skills,<br/>\nwe move on to more challenging play with the codes off.  We have gamesharks<br/>\nfor two of our consoles, but haven&#39;t needed one yet for the PS2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of these things as like training wheels.  Is that cheating?  Who&#39;s<br/>\nlosing? Who is being treated unfairly?  When my son and I play chess,<br/>\nsometimes I start down a piece, occasionally it&#39;s the queen (it&#39;s up to him<br/>\nbased on how much of a challenge he wants) and then I know I am in for a<br/>\nchallenge.  But I&#39;m not being treated unfairly.  Unfairness is wrong,<br/>\ndishonesty is wrong, but I think breaking rules is only wrong when the<br/>\nconsequences are wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, people who make rules usually don&#39;t make them to be examined and<br/>\nthought about.  They&#39;re not usually presented as &quot;optional&quot; or &quot;flexible.&quot;<br/>\nNathan and Cris and I have talked quite a bit about rules and the ethics of<br/>\nplay, how this relates to other situations, you know - &quot;the real world&quot;.<br/>\nThese conversations have grown out of Nathan&#39;s concern about the ethics of<br/>\nusing &quot;cheat&quot; codes since he knows &quot;cheating is wrong&quot;.  He is delightfully<br/>\nhonest.  It&#39;s one of the things I admire about him most of all.  So we talk<br/>\nit through and think about different examples.  And as we explore, lots of<br/>\nshades of gray emerge. Traveling further...colors!<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think anything in life is simple.  Really.  It&#39;s a curse, but there<br/>\nit is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, deeply, that real cheating is wrong.  If an Olympic skier takes a<br/>\nshortcut on the cross-country course and wins, that&#39;s bad because games like<br/>\nthe Olympics are one of the few things in life that are designed to be<br/>\n&quot;fair.&quot;  (back to the Princess Bride quote) But the distinction is in the<br/>\ndishonesty, not the rule-breaking.  Athletes agree to the rules before the<br/>\ngame starts and it if they don&#39;t abide by them, they&#39;re disqualified.<br/>\nThat&#39;s how it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames, though, aren&#39;t an applicable metaphor for all the things in life one<br/>\ndoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf two people are playing a game and both agree to change the rules, right<br/>\nin the middle of the game, that&#39;s not cheating, that&#39;s innovation.  If<br/>\nyou&#39;re playing a video game, you can only cheat yourself out of a greater<br/>\nchallenge.  And that&#39;s your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrawing on what I do for a living, if I go out to the web and find free<br/>\nsource code (or copy my co-worker&#39;s code) that solves a problem and get a<br/>\nprogram written in half the time, that makes my boss very happy.  And my<br/>\nco-worker is flattered.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch of the mindset I need for work is in the willingness to identify which<br/>\nrules can be broken and which ones cannot, and seeing how much advantage can<br/>\nbe gained by breaking the ones that can be broken.  In my job, I&#39;d guess I<br/>\nbreak more rules than I follow.  We call it thinking outside the box, but we<br/>\nall know you can&#39;t wear Bermuda shorts and a tank top to work.  Ahhhh,<br/>\nBalance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the thing: Knowing the difference between different kinds of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I try to communicate to Nathan in our play and daily life.  A<br/>\ndeeper understanding of how to play and live peacefully with others means<br/>\nyou need to have a sensitivity to the rules.  This carries over into family<br/>\nrules, and honestly - he will negotiate changes if he thinks a rule my wife<br/>\nand I have come up with could be changed or suspended.  This has been our<br/>\npolicy since he learned to talk.  And we have gotten really good at this<br/>\nnow, even though it baffles our friends and family when we take a time out<br/>\nto have a little &quot;hearing&quot; ;)  The rule he can&#39;t break in the negotiations<br/>\nis that the parents make the final ruling.  The ruling is probably final<br/>\nwhen both parents agree on a precise finding.  It&#39;s definitely final when<br/>\nboth parents agree it&#39;s final.  Is negotiating-after-the-fact kosher?<br/>\nAbsolutely not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes that negotiation is fruitful for him, sometimes it&#39;s just<br/>\n&quot;practice&quot; and he doesn&#39;t get what he was pursuing.  But I think it is so<br/>\nmuch better training for adulthood than living with the sense that all rules<br/>\nare unconditional and simply to be obeyed without thought or question.<br/>\nYuck!<br/>\n<br/>\nWay off course, but ok with it,<br/>\nMark</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"conferences and learning styles/directions","postDate":"1015686336","msgId":5451,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY0LjE4MDMxYzIzLjI5YmI3ZWMwQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5455,"prevInTime":5450,"nextInTime":5452,"topicId":5451,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" I think the whole conference is an","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1647667373\">&lt;&lt; Maybe an unschooling.com reunion?
