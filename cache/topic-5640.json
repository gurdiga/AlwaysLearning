They had planned to release it<br/>\ndirectly to video but are now considering releasing it to the theaters.<br/>\nDisney signed a deal to dub and subtitle and distribute nearly all of Hiyao<br/>\nMiyazaki&#39;s (the animator/director/writer) films. Some of his movies have<br/>\nbeen the highest grossing films of all time in Japan and I suspect Disney<br/>\nisn&#39;t confident that they will be as popular in the US but is afraid if they<br/>\nrelease them to video that they&#39;ll have blown a big money making<br/>\nopportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Disney didn&#39;t know what to do with his previous film, Princess<br/>\nMononoke, because it wasn&#39;t for kids and American teens and adults just<br/>\naren&#39;t used to more mature subjects in animation so it didn&#39;t do much for<br/>\ntheir confidence in the potential of the American audience for his films.<br/>\n(It&#39;s a wonderful film by the way. It makes anything done by Disney look<br/>\nlike pablum.) *Maybe*, *hopefully* after they release his newest, Spirited<br/>\nAway, they&#39;ll get more confident.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s an incredibly thorough fan website for Miyazaki&#39;s films:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://WWW.Nausicaa.net/\">http://WWW.Nausicaa.net/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download the script for Castle in the Air at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa/\">http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/laputa/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact if you click on Search you can type in script and get a list of all<br/>\nthe Miyazaki scripts available for download.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can keep updated on the deal with Disney at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://WWW.Nausicaa.net/miyazaki/disney/\">http://WWW.Nausicaa.net/miyazaki/disney/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269338,"authorName":"Cindy","from":"Cindy &lt;crma@...&gt;","profile":"crma53","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Videos","postDate":"1016762089","msgId":5713,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDOUE4RUU5LkEyQ0QwNjYyQGl4Lm5ldGNvbS5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDkuMjUxNTRhMmYuMjljYjZiZGZAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5675,"nextInTopic":5723,"prevInTime":5712,"nextInTime":5714,"topicId":5640,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
