My husband went  <br/>\non the Saturday with Senna and I went to the movie on Sunday with her.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a huge display of the new legendary Pokemon (good photo op), a  <br/>\nPokemon store (for plushies and t-shirts etc.), a stamp rally, an  <br/>\nactivity zone, a demo version of the game, and a downloadable Celebi  <br/>\nat Gamestop.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie tickets are free and they have around 6 showings a day, but  <br/>\nbe prepared to hang around and stand in line and have the distribution  <br/>\nchanged at the last minute &lt;sigh&gt;. Also, all the parties you want  <br/>\ntickets for must be present when you request tickets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe coolest thing is seeing just how many Pokemon afficionados there  <br/>\nare, young and older. Some cosplay, so it&#39;s fun figuring out what  <br/>\ncharacters they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":59552,"nextTopicId":59567}}
