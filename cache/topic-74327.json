I have art and humor to distribute, some good things from past years to revisit, and a blog to keep it on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have learned, though, is that the videos don&#39;t show on some phones, or iPads.  So tomorrow, please go here to see a video:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com\">http://learnnothingday.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you subscribe to the blog and look on a device that won&#39;t show videos, please try from a computer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMost entries are photos and that won&#39;t be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m also putting older Learn Nothing Day links and art, from years&#39; past, so it can be easily found and browsed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any of what you see there inspires you to create some art or write a testimonial or design a good plan for learning nothing, let me know!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two videos already, though, and another coming tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":74294,"nextTopicId":74305}}
