After this one, the next big-deal Learn Nothing Day will be in ten years, and then fifteen years.  If I’m still around, I’ll make a bigger deal on those years, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be 64 this year, on my birthday.  When I married Keith,  the recessional music (led by my sister and some other musician-friends) was “When I’m Sixty-Four,” by the Beatles.  We had the reception line set up in the back, and the attendees weren’t leaving their chairs, because they were all singing along.  Keith won’t be 64 for another three years, but I’m there now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’m sliding slowly into (for me) retirement.  I’m going to keep doing things until I stop. :-)<br/>\nMore on that is here, from November 2016:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2016/11/slowing-down.html\">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2016/11/slowing-down.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this group will survive a few more years!
