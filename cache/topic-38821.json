I&#39;ve seen RENT live quite a few times, including on Broadway  <br/>\njust a few months ago. I got pretty caught up in the performance and I  <br/>\nstarted to applaud with the filmed audience. One of my daughters  <br/>\ntouched my arm and I caught myself - I was the only person in the  <br/>\ntheater who was applauding. Later in the show, other people did the  <br/>\nsame thing, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot just &quot;watching&quot; - but sitting in a theater watching a film of a  <br/>\nshow being performed in front of an audience of people who were &quot;just  <br/>\nwatching.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt got me thinking about applause and audience reaction to a  <br/>\nperformance. A &quot;good&quot; audience can make show better. And vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, which means it is a good idea to clap and yell bravo like crazy  <br/>\nin the beginning of a show - get the performers psyched up.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, the applause won&#39;t have any effect when the show is on film -  <br/>\nguess that&#39;s one reason why people didn&#39;t applaud.

Paul Newman died.   <br/>\nPeople care.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if someone is an expert on baseball stats?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t know by watching what a person does whether it&#39;s valuable  <br/>\nemotionally or intellectually or morally to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s mom has always thought his SCA activity was stupid and a  <br/>\nwaste of time.  She was embarrassed that he dressed up and had a made- <br/>\nup  name.   Years back she worked at a hospital (head nurse of ICU)  <br/>\nand a friend of ours who was an anesthesist discovered the  <br/>\nconnection.  She told Keith&#39;s mom, at work, how wonderful Keith is,  <br/>\nhow talented, and how popular.  His mom was more impressed then, but  <br/>\nshe was impressed because a medical professional said Keith was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith is waking Marty up right now to go to fighter practice (armored  <br/>\ncombat get-together that happens every week here, and has since  <br/>\nbefore I knew Keith).   He told me a while ago that he doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>\nvery good and doesn&#39;t want to go, but Marty is just really getting  <br/>\ninto it lately and Keith wants to be supportive, and he likes to see  <br/>\npeople&#39;s reactions to Marty.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even though Keith and Marty are doing something of questionable  <br/>\nvalue on the general market of the respect activities get, Keith is  <br/>\ndirectly proud of Marty, and involved, and interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure stamp collecting or playing WoW would be any better or  <br/>\nworse.
