It is fun to sort<br/>\nthe cards -- I am thinking of keeping them and having my husband look<br/>\nthrough them/sort them.

He still pretty much rolls his eyes and thinks I&#39;m crazy if<br/>\nhe sees or hears the word &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I am being patient and<br/>\nbiding my time. The funny part is how many things we do that are in<br/>\nline with unschooling -- he just doesn&#39;t know it!
