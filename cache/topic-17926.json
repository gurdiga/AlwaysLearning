I am new to this list but after reading for a week or so I feel<br/>\nlike I have found my long-lost family!!!  Finally a group with whom I don&#39;t<br/>\nhave to explain EVERYTHING!!!  My name is Jen, my husband is Scott and we<br/>\nhave a dd who is three and three quarters (she ALWAYS adds the<br/>\n&quot;three-quarters&quot;  part.)  My husband works our of our house, I do not work<br/>\nfor pay.  I always knew I would unschool although I had a very positive,<br/>\nvery alternative (radical Montessori) school experience myself.  I won&#39;t get<br/>\ninto our life details here, I hope to get to know all of you better in the<br/>\nfuture.  My questions are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Evie will be our only child.  I am interested in hearing from others who<br/>\nhave only children (I am an &quot;only&quot; myself.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2)  I am interested in hearing about the things you all do with your young<br/>\nkids.  I am especially interested in hearing about situations when your kids<br/>\nare clamoring to learn something specific and yet tend to lose interest if<br/>\nthey are explicitly &quot;taught&quot; one way.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) What does &quot;strewing&quot; look like in your house with young kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I have been dying to share the following anecdote with a group who<br/>\nwould appreciate it.  My daughter was jumping on our bed with her closest<br/>\nneighborhood friend.  This friend is in daycare all week and has an older<br/>\nsister who is in &quot;away school&quot; as Evie calls it (as opposed to<br/>\n&quot;homeschool&quot;).  Evie loves to count and so she was counting their jumps.<br/>\nShe was up to about 124 (I don&#39;t really know how or when she learned to<br/>\ncount that high) when her friend asked &quot;how do keep all those numbers in the<br/>\nright order?&quot;  I was downstairs, I couldn&#39;t wait to hear Evie&#39;s answer.  She<br/>\nstopped jumping, thought for a minute and then said, &quot;You just let them leak<br/>\nout of your head!&quot;  She then resumed jumping as if that were a perfectly<br/>\nlogical explanation.  I smiled and thought &quot;you got it kid!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t wait to learn and share more with all of you!<br/>\n<br/>\nJen L. <br/>\nMadison, WI</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18023,"nextTopicId":18020}}
