He was nursing on demand and sleeping with us  <br/>\nand we didn&#39;t &quot;put him down&quot; for naps.  I read an article in  <br/>\nMothering Magazine about kids choosing their own foods if they&#39;re  <br/>\nallowed to, and so we did that.  One of the LLL leaders had told me  <br/>\nthat a good time to give kids solid foods is when they&#39;re reaching  <br/>\nfor them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was impressed and surprised at his food choices.  So by the time  <br/>\nMarty and Holly came along, I was an old hand at it.  With my first I  <br/>\nWANTED to feed him baby food, and had a little manual baby-food- <br/>\ngrinder and powdered dried fruits and all kinds of stuff, but he  <br/>\nliked nursing lots more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Marty and Holly I really did wait until they reached for stuff,  <br/>\nand I was more likely to give them finger-mashed &quot;people food&quot; than  <br/>\nbaby food.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Holly was born we were unschooling Kirby, so it must have  <br/>\nseemed all of one cloth to her.  And probably to Kirby too, since our  <br/>\nthoughts that he would go to school didn&#39;t translate into going to  <br/>\nschool, in his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my kids think before they eat.  They will not eat something  <br/>\njust because it smells good or looks good because someone worked hard  <br/>\nin the kitchen or wants them to eat it.  They eat because they&#39;re  <br/>\nhungry, and they choose foods that they need.  I&#39;m not very good at  <br/>\nthinking about what I need, but they&#39;re GREAT at it.  If something  <br/>\nsmells good, they smell it and admire the scent.  If something looks  <br/>\ngood, they admire it and compliment the maker.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Okay, now about food ;) WAS Re: need links to similar article","postDate":"1222487197","msgId":38757,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUwRTI3RUE4LTZGRkItNEYyNi1BNDQ1LTU0QkFFQTRGMUY2NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM2NDM4ODRjMDgwOTI2MTk1N3Q5OTJlNTBjc2RhOWQ2ZTU5MDM4ZjJmNTRAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDk5ZmIwOTA3MDgwOTI0MjExMXI2ODlhZjI0NXI5NTQ2YmJkYzc4NmQ0MTliQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Z2JobjEyKzdsZXJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDxjNjQzODg0YzA4MDkyNjE5NTd0OTkyZTUwY3NkYTlkNmU1OTAzOGYyZjU0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38751,"nextInTopic":38759,"prevInTime":38756,"nextInTime":38758,"topicId":38652,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Laureen, that story about the Persian sweets and garlic was great!

In the absence of real <br/>\nmedical conditions, they will work well if given a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatch your language. Women in this culture are particularly prone to using <br/>\nmoral imperatives around food eg &quot;I was bad today; I ate three chocolates&quot; <br/>\nor &quot;I&#39;ve been good about going to the gym so I deserve this smoothie as a <br/>\nreward.&quot; Don&#39;t do it. Speak about food with enjoyment for its own sake, not <br/>\nas a compass for judging your behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeware of unconciously rewarding an empty plate with your attitude. Beware <br/>\nof saying someone is a &quot;good eater&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has always eaten a large quantity of one food at each meal, picking <br/>\nslightly at the other parts. For example a lot of mashed potato, a lot of <br/>\nbrocolli, a lot of grean beans, a lot of breaded chicken, a lot of ice <br/>\ncream, a lot of noodles, a lot of toast, a lot of bacon, a lot of cookies, a <br/>\nlot of chips, a lot of strawberries. She will ask if she has a hankering for <br/>\nsomething.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result of long observation, I can predict when she is about to have a <br/>\ngrowth spurt or a cognitive leap by her food choices. She will suddenly <br/>\nstart carbo loading, eating tons of mashed and roasted potato, tons of <br/>\nnoodles with a dash of oil and garlic spray, tons of toast with mayonaise, <br/>\npancakes, rice, cookies and more potatoes. Within a week or so she clearly <br/>\nhas made a jump of some kind - we notice it in an expansion of her <br/>\nvocabulary, an increased sophistication of her observations. Generally she <br/>\nwill suddenly be half an inch taller too.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will follow this week of carbs with a few days of light eating <br/>\nemphasizing protein and dairy, asking for snacks of plates of grated cheese, <br/>\nchicken, steak, jerky, yoghurt, vanilla ice cream, scrambled eggs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I put out sliced fruit with her snacks she will eat a lot of it. We make <br/>\nskillet meals a lot, and she will pick out of them what she particularly <br/>\nwants.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn between these intermittent and unpredictable growth spurt/recovery <br/>\nmoments she eats a wide variety of stuff, sometimes finding it hard to <br/>\nchoose or know what she wants. In the absence of a hankering for something, <br/>\nI just list what I have and am able to prepare and she usually finds <br/>\nsomething appealing. If nothing seems to work, and she has said no to some <br/>\nfavorites, I tend to just &quot;make myself &quot; ;) something from the list that I <br/>\nknow she has liked in the past, and usually she will then see and smell it <br/>\nand want a portion.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we have dinner at the table, it is usually pretty special. Jayn <br/>\ndecorates the table with dolls and candles. I tend to put out serving <br/>\nplatters of the various foods and we all help ourselves to what we want, <br/>\nrather than serve up in the kitchen.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn will sometimes want something to keep her going when I am in the middle <br/>\nof cooking a meal. I tell her how long it will be, and she tells me what she <br/>\nwants to eat in the mean time - often a cookie or some chips or crackers. So <br/>\nI give it to her, and she still eats some of her dinner - as much as she <br/>\nwants. Some days a lot, others a few bites.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Jayn gets hungry, most particularly if she is growth spurt mode, because <br/>\nI haven&#39;t been watching the clock or checking in, or she has been too <br/>\noccupied to notice her hunger, she can get particularly obnoxious, cranky, <br/>\naggressive and locked in to being unable to choose what to eat. <br/>\nUnfortunately I usually just have to ride it out, protect myself from her <br/>\nhitting and kicking, and keep on trying to get some quick food into her. <br/>\nWhen I first see the signs I will often hurry in to the kitchen a make a <br/>\nyoghurt smoothie which does the trick of restoring her equilibrium. Or I <br/>\nmake a sandwich. Or I give her a cookie! But truly the best thing is not to <br/>\nlet it get that bad - to keep food available.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are out I always have the snack bag with an assortment of things. <br/>\nShe will eat differently out at the park than at home. For example at home <br/>\nshe will rarely ask for an apple, but will eat the sliced one I put out. At <br/>\nthe park she will come to the bag and take an apple away with her to eat. At <br/>\nhome she will refuse a sandwich; at the park or when playing outside, she <br/>\nwill eat several quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Jayn asked for homemade vanilla cupcakes, chocolate chip cookies, <br/>\ncorn and couscous, a grilled cheese sandwich, potato chips, sushi, sliced <br/>\napple, samples of chicken at the store, lemonade, chocolate milk, some <br/>\ntoblerone, ice cream and iced water. We also bought some new things at the <br/>\nstore to try out over the next few days, but I forgot popsicles.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Jayn has asked for and had bacon and eggs, a chicken noodle stir fry <br/>\nwith carrots & brocolli, breaded shrimp (didn&#39;t like it), sticky cinnamon <br/>\ncake with icing, strawberries and whipped cream, lemonade and iced water. <br/>\nShe has just asked for more corn and couscous, triggered by me reading this <br/>\nlist to her... (returning from the kitchen)... Alas half of the toblerone <br/>\nfell on the ground yesterday so she had none left for today. But we&#39;ll get <br/>\nsome more next time we go out.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn&#39;s favorite vegetables are artichoke, asparagus and potatoes in various <br/>\nincarnations. She also likes green beans and corn. Her favorite fruits are <br/>\npears, strawberries, apples and bananas in smoothies. She sometimes wants <br/>\npeaches, grapes and oranges/mandarins. Every now and then she has a <br/>\nhankering for a salad if we have chinese salad dressing - so I try to keep <br/>\nit on hand. She will add garlic to anything savory. Her far and away most <br/>\nfavorite food is sushi, and her favorite snack is Tim&#39;s Hawaiian Chips in <br/>\nMaui Onion flavor (the lilac bag).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we eat fast food, she will rarely consume an entire cheeseburger, and <br/>\nthen only if she eats no fries at all. If she eats the fries I usually find <br/>\nthe burger with only one bite out of it. We used to buy meringues for a <br/>\nwhile, (that I tend to love to eat). I would give Jayn all she wanted then <br/>\nlater find half meringues sitting on the arm of the chair or the floor by <br/>\nher play area or on the bedside table. We&#39;ve gone off meringues for the <br/>\npresent, but they may well return to favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI provide, I watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t buy candy except at Halloween.

If I finished one bag  <br/>\n(Almond M&Ms were irresistible at the time) I promised myself I could  <br/>\nhave another. It did take 3 bags! but I did get over the craving.

Most people would say that&#39;s true  <br/>\nbut most people don&#39;t have a tap of running cookies freely  <br/>\naccessible ;-) So they&#39;re making assumptions without actually  <br/>\ntesting. They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re like when cookies are as easy  <br/>\nto get as water. They only know what they&#39;re like when cookies appear  <br/>\nlike an oasis in a desert.<br/>\n<br/>\n(And if the obvious conclusion was always the true answer, no one  <br/>\nwould have ever questioned whether the sun goes around the earth,  <br/>\nsince we can see that it does, plain as day! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My kids eat plenty of good stuff, but I don&#39;t know how to make sure<br/>\n&gt; they don&#39;t get too many sweets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t know because you&#39;re using your external monitor to judge  <br/>\nwhat&#39;s going on inside of someone else.

What if they eat a  <br/>\ndozen? Your fears are stopping you from doing ... what exactly? Think  <br/>\nabout it! Really. Do you fear that if you let them eat 5 dozen  <br/>\ncookies that they won&#39;t ever eat anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect the questions are sounding snarky as though I&#39;m saying &quot;Are  <br/>\nyou so dim as to believe what conventional parents believe?&quot; But they  <br/>\naren&#39;t. They&#39;re honest questions. Most parents don&#39;t think. They  <br/>\nfear. And they reach for answers that will soothe their fears. We ask  <br/>\npeople to think! :-) And ask people to try it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat *will* happen if you make 5 dozen cookies every day for the next  <br/>\n5 weeks? Why would parents be afraid to try it? What do they fear  <br/>\nwould happen? (No one needs to answer that here. It&#39;s just something  <br/>\nto ponder why it would seem a better idea to ask strangers than to  <br/>\nreally think about something and try it out.
