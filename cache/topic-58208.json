So<br/>\nI just stayed calm and then guess what happened Ishaan (my 5 year old)<br/>\nshouted for his sister and then they both watched the shot and laughed<br/>\nloudly and said yuck yuck yuck several times before they almost fell off<br/>\ntheir seats laguhing. so I laughed along and then Ishaan said, &quot;hey mom<br/>\nwhere are the ships man???&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested we try DISC 2. So that is what we did and that had sailors<br/>\nenjoying jazz on board!!! By then my son had lost his patience and has<br/>\ndecided to take BCL to task for deceiving him!! He does not want to look at<br/>\nthe DVD any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter of course asked me a few questions on the women so I answered<br/>\nmatter-of-fact. They let the case rest....
