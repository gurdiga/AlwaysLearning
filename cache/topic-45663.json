You <br/>\ndevelop  your imagination when reading whereas the screen does everything for <br/>\nyou so not  much in the way of brain function going on while you watch!-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nIt made me laugh to think of using a computer as passive unimaginative  <br/>\nentertainment, especially because of what I&#39;ve watched Jess do this week.  <br/>\n <br/>\nShe&#39;s been ill with tonsillitis, so we&#39;ve missed the short spasm of  <br/>\nglorious weather that will probably count for our English summer.  To  keep <br/>\nherself amused, she spent a fair old time lazing on the sofa with  her laptop.   <br/>\nShe decided to sample the sounds of words  generated by HalReader, a <br/>\ntext-to-voice processor.  She then modulated  and tuned the outputs to different <br/>\npitches, and slotted them  into rhythmic patterns on an audio multitracking <br/>\nprogramme to make her  own music (quite funky, if you could imagine Kraftwerk <br/>\nwith a vaguely Latin  beat).   I just loved watching this creativity unfold  <br/>\n... and  then that message popped up on my PC.  I realized that if you don&#39;t <br/>\n look closely at this kind of thing all you see is some zombie kid gazing  <br/>\nhypnotically at a screen.  What a shame.  And what a buzz it is to be  <br/>\nlearning to participate more and  observe more closely!<br/>\n <br/>\nIncidentally, I&#39;d like to add my voice to all the others who think Holly&#39;s  <br/>\nvideo is FABULOUS!  (And, as far as I&#39;d always understood, the convention  <br/>\nof talking to an interviewer slightly offline from the camera was developed  <br/>\nbecause most viewers find too much direct-to-camera eye contact  <br/>\noverpowering.)  ...
