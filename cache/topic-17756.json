Sounds definately scarring.  Around<br/>\nhere the kids eat whatever they want for breakfast:<br/>\nleftover birthday cake, cereal, oatmeal, pickles,<br/>\nfried eggs and honey cornbread are a sample of recent<br/>\nchoices.  It&#39;s the one meal a day when I will play<br/>\nshort order cook.  Since we&#39;re unschoolers, every day<br/>\nis a &quot;weekday&quot; (a day in the week) right?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bulk of the day we graze, and I generally make<br/>\nmore food for myself than I can eat when I make a<br/>\nlunch, as the kids &quot;forget&quot; to eat until they smell my<br/>\nfood cooking and then come howling into the kitchen<br/>\nlike ravenous wolves.  Dinner we encourage them to eat<br/>\nwith us and be social, but it&#39;s not &quot;required&quot; that<br/>\nthey do so.  If they run off with their food to watch<br/>\na movie, it&#39;s nice to have a quiet dinner with my<br/>\nhubby once in a while!  We don&#39;t have any such thing<br/>\nas &quot;dessert.&quot;  Sweets are for when you feel like it,<br/>\nnot some pre-specified time, nor as a reward for<br/>\neating things you don&#39;t like.  Nobody around here eats<br/>\nthings they don&#39;t like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are, unfortunately, some villianous foods in my<br/>\nolder son&#39;s mind, as eating them will probably kill<br/>\nhim.  But others of us eat those thigs and are careful<br/>\nto clean up afterwards.  We don&#39;t have a lot of &quot;junk<br/>\nfood&quot; in the house, or food with no nutritional value.<br/>\n Even the potato chips we have in the house are yummy<br/>\nand full of nutritional value (yeah! Terra Chips!) <br/>\nThey do have a treat jar, which they fill with<br/>\nwhatever they want each time we go shopping and eat at<br/>\nwhatever pace they want.  It&#39;s usually never empty. <br/>\nThe cookie jar is the same way, which they have free<br/>\naccess to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have a son who has a tendancy to be sugar addicted,<br/>\nand has impulse control problems.  So it&#39;s not like I<br/>\nhave stepford kids and this is just a cakewalk (food<br/>\npun intended) with my particular kids, to have them<br/>\nnot eating sweets all day.  If Thomas gets hungry he<br/>\nwill ALWAYS go for the sugary stuff first.  What I try<br/>\nto do is head him off.  I will cook up some of his<br/>\nfavorite things (he loves hot foods) and offer them to<br/>\nhim when I think he might be hungry, and that prevents<br/>\nhim from wating to go for the sugar.  If I make<br/>\nsomething and put it in from of him, he will usually<br/>\neat it.  If I am not in time and he is wanting to<br/>\ngorge on the cookie jar or something, then I just make<br/>\nthe food anyway and offer it to him as well, and he<br/>\nusually eats it and cuts short his sugar binge.  I<br/>\nalso talk to him about how he feels when he eats<br/>\ncertain things and he forms opinions about which ways<br/>\nhe doesn&#39;t like to feel.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17754,"nextTopicId":17750}}
