We&#39;ve discussed facing and conquering fears on this list.  It&#39;s a good thing to sometimes think about our fears one at a time.  It encourages the process of delving our fears to begin to change them.  But this quote also brought to mind that there is a shift in how and why we want to change our lives.  Our reason for beginning may not be the reason we continue.  It&#39;s been said that change can only happen from within, and yet we see people on this list seeking permission to change.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be helpful to ask yourself why you want to change and how you want to live.  Facing my fears about schooling issues seemed a move towards understanding unschooling.  But somewhere along the way, I stopped thinking in terms of school at all, and started thinking about changing my life just to be happy.  I missed being curious and interested in the world around me, some ideas I lived fully when I was a child. Making changes in my life helped me push past the idea that adulthood is unpleasantly difficult.  I&#39;m hoping my children will not get that idea at all.  We can marvel at how happy and free-spirited our children are, but are we thinking about our children being that way as adults?  I sure hope my children continue to have a positive way of thinking as they grow older.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once had a homeschool mom tell me that she thought unschooling was the best way for children to follow interests and learn about the world, but that once the children hit middle school age, they needed to learn that life can&#39;t be all roses.  I remember thinking how sad that was, but I didn&#39;t really grasp what was wrong with that idea until much later.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48648,"nextTopicId":48684}}
