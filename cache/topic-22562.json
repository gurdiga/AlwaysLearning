We also own many many<br/>\nGameBoys of all varieties. One reason we got the GameCube(s) is that<br/>\nwith a few extra pieces, you can 1. play GameBoy games on the<br/>\nGameCube (with a GameBoy adaptor), and 2. use the GameBoy to get to<br/>\nextra features in some GameCube games (such as Animal Crossing, with<br/>\na Game Link cable) and 3. use the Game Boy as a controller in some<br/>\ngames (like Zelda Four Swords, with a Game Link cable).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also got the GameCubes because my kids prefer those games (they<br/>\nlike the Zelda and Mario characters which are Nintendo only). Donkey<br/>\nKonga alone is worth the GameCube IMO. GameCube is the system my kids<br/>\nalways recommend as a &quot;first&quot; system, or if your kids are under 12 or<br/>\nso. YMMV and all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got the PS2 for the sole purpose of hacking it to play Japanese<br/>\nimport PS2 games. :) It&#39;s great for that but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s<br/>\ngood in other respects. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo opinion on Xbox, we don&#39;t own one and have never used one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a used game store, like Game Stop or EB World, you could<br/>\ntry those for cheaper systems. They usually have a decent return<br/>\npolicy for used equipment. They also sell refurbished ones which are<br/>\ncheaper than new. Or, watch the ads at Toys R Us and Best Buy and<br/>\nsuch, they&#39;ll sometimes toss in controllers or games as a bundle.<br/>\nAlso, our local Target was selling PS1&#39;s pretty cheap but it&#39;s an<br/>\nolder system and it may be harder to find games for it now.<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\ncarelia ~ C.

My son really wanted to play the Zelda games, which is for Gamecube.  We have had no problems with the refurbished one.

Ours is mostly used for the Halos.  Although, Legos Starwars did come out for that too.<br/>\n <br/>\nWe also like the Gameboy Player attachment.

One of the coolest features is that you can buy <br/>\na screen that attaches to the box, so you don&#39;t have to have a TV to <br/>\nplay it.

BAAAAD move! The games for the X-Box were <br/>\nway over his head (we got it when he was six). I&#39;d asked several <br/>\npeople, and one of the adult gamers said that X-Box was THE best! Maybe <br/>\nfor him and other adults! But for a little six year old, the game <br/>\nselection was crap! They&#39;ve gotten better over the years, but I still <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t start with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve found that PS2 has the best selection of games.
