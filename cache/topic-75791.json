He&#39;s 28. He&#39;s brought his partner and her six-year-old daughter.  They plan to be here for many months, maybe a year or years. :-)  It&#39;s interesting for it to be so open-ended.   But the &quot;what can I do to make your day better?&quot; method can work with situations other than just marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the idea of partnership with a child should include that thought, too, even if the children are little.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":564662503,"authorName":"Shira Rocklin","from":"Shira Rocklin &lt;sj.rocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Article about saving a marriage","postDate":"1427813278","msgId":75791,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQk5SZUZ2ck9UQV9uRDNxV1dHc0VjM29FVXYraThSb2JaMVpzWEtjRzVhTXRmS3VZZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75792,"prevInTime":75790,"nextInTime":75792,"topicId":75791,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This reminds me of some of the other reading materials shared here over the years about improving marriages/partnerships.
