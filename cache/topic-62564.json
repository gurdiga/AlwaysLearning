For instance, if your son&#39;s real wish is to dress his avatar up in gladiatorial armor and fight other players, there are gladiatorial rings set up on Minecraft for that purpose. You can get different types of armor through existing mods, or buy learning to create Minecraft skins (much much easier than learning to build a mod!). <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, maybe there are ways to encourage your son&#39;s creativity besides actually learning to program. My son (9) has written many pages of mod descriptions, for instance. That may be something you could work on with your son. It&#39;s a super fun creative project. Take a look at minecraftforum.net to see the information a programmer might need to build a mod, and then you could work with your son to type up a detailed description of his dream mod. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son understands that you must learn to program using Java to build Minecraft mods, and you think he has an interest in learning to program, then YouTube may be a helpful resource for you. My son is a bit older (9) and he (with my husband and I along side him) has started working his way through a really great Java tutorial presented on YouTube (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)\">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28)</a>. I&#39;m not sure if your son would be interested in that Java tutorial, but perhaps you could check it out and learn along with him. It&#39;s really very good. The guy who made it doesn&#39;t give overview information or philosophize or send you out to research which compiler to use. He just tells you step by step how to download the files you need to get started, including the free Java compiler called Eclipse (the most popular one for Java, I&#39;m told). Then he starts by having you copy a Hello World program and run it in Eclipse, and the lessons gradually build from there.  Each lesson is short, and so far (as far as we&#39;ve gotten) they end with a tangible accomplishment, which (so far) pleases my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, modding is complicated, and learning Java is just the first step in the process, and learning Java is complicated. But the journey of a thousand miles starts with that proverbial one first step. The Java tutorial *may* appeal even to a six year old, depending on your particular 6 year old. And then again, it may not. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour son&#39;s age may not necessarily be a barrier to his beginning to learn programming. I was just at an unschoolers&#39; gathering last May where there was a 10 year old who had designed and programmed his own videogame. I didn&#39;t see the game, but James Bach (author of &quot;Secrets of a Buccaneer-Scholar: How Self-Education and the Pursuit of Passion Can Lead to a Lifetime of Success&quot;) did and said it was impressive. There was a teenager at that same gathering who had already created a commercial game app. His mom confirmed that he&#39;d made money from it. So, who knows what may become of your son&#39;s interest? <br/>\n<br/>\nKeep it light and fun, and see what works for your son. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, and happy modding.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatricia<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Genevieve Raymond &lt;genevieve.raymond@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sam, who will be 7 in November, REALLY wants to build his own Minecraft mod.
