Hang up the Math Calendar for <br/>\nKids - act like you can hardly wait everyday to fool with that day&#39;s puzzle <br/>\n(it has interesting problems and the answer is always the date - so getting <br/>\nthe answer is never the point which might remove a little anxiety right <br/>\nthere! &lt;G&gt;).  Just saying things like, &quot;Hey, that is cool,&quot; makes a <br/>\ndifference, I think.  And the other thing is to get a feeling for what math <br/>\nreally is -- that computational skills are to math what phonics are to <br/>\nreading -- not much fun and not satisfying in and of themselves -- sort of <br/>\nnecessary eventually and most often just picked up along the way but you <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to wait until you know it ALL before you can start enjoying real <br/>\nmath any more than you wait until a kid knows all the phonics rules before <br/>\nthey can start enjoying books.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":113,"nextTopicId":116}}
