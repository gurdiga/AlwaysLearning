Yep, as of just a minute ago, there were 1212 members at UD.  <br/>\nYou can find this info on the Unschooling Discussion group page...at <br/>\nthe top of the page (right under Unschooling Discussion) there are <br/>\nthree options:  Start a new topic, Unsub or change membership, and <br/>\nAbout Group.  If you click on About Group, it&#39;ll take you to the page <br/>\nwith group numbers, description of the group, archives, and even top <br/>\nposters for the month (I think that&#39;s a really cool feature...I dunno <br/>\nwhy). ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nRen, this is what I did to help with the move.  I already had a gmail <br/>\naccount that I wasn&#39;t using much, so I went ahead and joined UD under <br/>\nthat account (autodidactsanonymous) and unsubbed my yahoo ID.  I have <br/>\na <br/>\nlittle Gmail letter icon to announce when there&#39;s new mail on the <br/>\nbottom of my screen, and I click on that to open up gmail (in a new <br/>\nwindow).

I would go back and forth, changing my membership <br/>\nfrom digest to read on list only, then back to individual posts.I <br/>\ndon&#39;t like reading my fave unschooling lists on <br/>\ndigest...I just feel like I miss too much, and I&#39;d rather have each <br/>\npost separate.  NOW, it seems easier to me...Gmail pops up, and I <br/>\nread <br/>\nmy &quot;conversations&quot; together.  There are features of google groups <br/>\nthat <br/>\nI still haven&#39;t played around with, and I&#39;m certainly no expert, but <br/>\nI <br/>\njust wanted to share what I had done to &quot;help with the move&quot;, on my <br/>\nend.
