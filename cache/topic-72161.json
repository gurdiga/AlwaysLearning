I also have a very rich and fascinating inner world that I share","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-418353011\">I am highly introverted, as well as shy (though less shy as an adult than I was as a child).  I also have a very rich and fascinating inner world that I share with Very Few people.  I&#39;ve always had difficulty bridging the gap between my inner world and the world outside, and i really hate small talk, which is one of the reasons I much prefer to be alone or with a few select people, preferably not too many at once. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child and teenager I was often mocked for being quiet, reserved, absorbed in my own private activity while others were active around me, or for being socially awkward.  I Need to watch situations before getting involved.  Sometimes, I choose to watch the whole time, and I quite enjoy myself that way.  Others will comment &quot;you&#39;re so quiet!&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t talk much, huh?&quot;, as if maybe I wasn&#39;t aware I was being quiet.  Usually these comments are from people I know care about me, though they don&#39;t really understand me, but my reaction (which I keep to myself) ranges from irritation to anger, depending on my mood and how recently somebody else said the same thing.  Those comments generally come from a place of insensitivity, or a misunderstanding of introversion and/or shyness, or a mistaken belief that &quot;you need to get involved!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom is very perceptive and sensitive and always had my back as a kid (she was also very shy).  I don&#39;t remember her ever suggesting I do something she knew might make me uncomfortable - instead she would ask if I wanted to try something, without showing discomfort that I might say no.  That was a really big help for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter is 2.5, and shows some very similar tendencies and preferences for social interaction (or lack thereof) as I did.  Caring family members have expressed concern for how she&#39;ll &quot;learn to socialize&quot; without school.  I point out that not only did school Not help me learn to socialize, it caused me to feel rejected, flawed, insecure, and at times utterly despondent and lonely.  There were many times, especially during my torturous middle school years, that I wished I didn&#39;t have to leave my house or worry about making friends.  I like to think if I&#39;d been unschooled I could have done what I needed.  My mom wishes she&#39;d known about other options than sending me into the social hell I found at school.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn college I waited tables.  That&#39;s when I really learned how to socialize.  It was the first time I was truly motivated.  In school I so desperately wished to be left alone that I wasn&#39;t actually motivated (nor did I have the energy) to learn how to be &quot;normal&quot;, i.e. extroverted.  But when my take home pay depended on it, I learned the skills I needed fast, and got really good at it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow as an adult I so value my introversion and the gifts it has given me as an artist, empath, and friend.  I have no desire to be different than I am, and the fact that my mom felt the same way the whole time I was growing up was immeasurably helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ncheri</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Introverted and shy","postDate":"1379180966","msgId":72183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhQVnlBZDhnMmFIeUVOYlp0TjVYR2JXejBnZ2tWNmdIRlBPdmRrQlVfMD1vQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGwxMXIxcysxNTBnZmlsQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzNzkxMDI1MDkuMTMwNDkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjAwMy5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+CTxsMTFyMXMrMTUwZ2ZpbEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72182,"nextInTopic":72184,"prevInTime":72182,"nextInTime":72184,"topicId":72161,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She had a meltdown pretty much every single day in the car on the way home. And she had to find ways to withdraw during the day. She used to sit in the leg-space of the teacher&#39;s big metal desk. She remembers putting her cheek against the cool metal to help calm herself down. <br>\n<br>My 2nd daughter, who is quite introverted, was also in a classroom like that for a while but her teachers were super accommodating it was amazing - she was allowed to just leave the classroom absolutely any time  she wanted to go to the media center and find a book and sit quietly in a corner by herself. And they had outdoor space and she could take a book and go sit outside alone, too. Also the classroom was very large and they had lot of cuddly little corners kind of cut off from the rest of the classroom where she could sit or lie down on cushions. So for a kid who was a reader there were plentiful opportunities to escape into a book or put on earphones and listen to books. <br>\n<br>Families can be hard in the same ways, though, if they are not careful about creating environments that accommodate all the various temperaments of members of that family. <br><br>-pam</div></div><br><br></span></blockquote></div></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Introverted and shy","postDate":"1379177931","msgId":72185,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwxMjRrYitnYjQ3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY0NjVBMDI2LTFFRDgtNEIzNi05MzNELTY2RDQ3NjA0MDFBNEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":72184,"nextInTopic":0,"prevInTime":72184,"nextInTime":72186,"topicId":72161,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She gets exhausted by being around other people. She doesn&#39;t do small talk comfortably or enjoy it much. Those who know her know she&#39;s delightful! But she needs her alone time a LOT. And she has no big urge to have a lot of friends hanging around all the time - she wants to hang out in groups just once in a while and usually not for long periods of time. I used to worry that she didn&#39;t have enough friends. I&#39;d push her to go to activities when she didn&#39;t really want to go.

They caused him a lot of stress.  He is eloquent and great fun when he is with special friends and families that he trusts.  Our instinct was to worry about this, as we are constantly led to believe that in our society we should be &#39;out there&#39;, and sociable and &#39;go getting&#39;.  Especially boys.  My husband would want to &#39;toughen him up&#39;, but I resisted this, sensing it  would cause a huge gulf of mistrust, of both his family and the world.  So here we are, unschooling and loving it… and I am internally thanking my son (and this forum!) for opening up this opportunity for the whole family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like you are really recognising the need to respect your son and his need for observation and quiet, and that is wonderful, he is blessed.  But you cannot quite be at rest with it in yourself. Is that because you were not fully accepted as &#39;shy&#39; when you were younger?  Were you constantly expected to be different? What helped me to understand my son better was a book called &#39;The Highly Sensitive Child&#39; by Elaine N. Aron.  She worked with highly sensitive adults and found that one thing they seemed to have in common was being misunderstood as children.  So she wrote a book to help us parent these children better!  It was so helpful to me, and is helping me to accept him as he is - which is very different to me!  I won&#39;t go into it here, but whilst recognising that there are overlapping traits with high sensitivity and Aspergers she maintains they are not the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAn anecdote:  I watched my boy at a big social gathering recently.  He is 11, and we were camping in a big field with lots of other families that we know fairly well.  He spent a lot of time reading in his tent while the other children were rushing about chucking water over each other, teasing each other, playing havoc, and breaking the PA system!  Just as I was worried that he was unliked, couldn&#39;t fit in, social outcast… all the cliches.. and I was having to tie myself down so that I didnt go and try to coax him out of his tent, he had enough of his book, stepped out and stepped right into the game.  Fine.  Giggling, totally accepted. Bossing them about a bit in fact! Then just as it turned unkind or chaotic,  he quietly stepped out again, back into his tent. He did this a few times. I was in awe of his self possession to be honest and am so glad I didn&#39;t go in and try to get him to socialise on terms that weren&#39;t his own.  I wish I had had that level of self knowledge at that age.  Any age…  <br/>\n<br/>\nA retired primary school teacher friend of mine is convinced that the increased diagnosis of Aspergers and Autism these days is due to relentless overstimulation and expectation of sensitive children.  Lets let them go at their own pace and trust… watch… wait… enjoy!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Introverted and shy","postDate":"1379000483","msgId":72177,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwwc25iMys1M2ppQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNzg5MTgzODIuMjQ1NDguWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjAwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":72176,"nextInTopic":72178,"prevInTime":72176,"nextInTime":72178,"topicId":72161,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It&#39;s often a kind of learning style for social situations - a need to observe people and group interactions for a time before making decisions about getting involved. If someone is shy in that way, it&#39;s not only unhelpful to suggest they go get involved with someone new, it&#39;s counterproductive - they won&#39;t learn effectively in the middle of a new social situation and will end up feeling even more awkward and inept.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This really applies to Ethan, and always has.  From the time he could walk and talk, he would hang back a while and observe - sometimes a long while - before he would find someone he felt he could relate to enough to join in.  If he didn&#39;t find that someone he would leave without joining in.   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe still will do this.  I worry about the hanging back and watching because I worry (again with the worry) that people will find that either creepy or antisocial.  So, then I feel the need to say something (gently) like, &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you go say hi.&quot;  I&#39;m not sure where to give a gentle push and where to allow him move forward at his own pace.  I think if he was a close friend, I still would say something encouraging.  Maybe that isn&#39;t helpful in any relationship.  I&#39;m really not sure unfortunately.  Understanding social interactions is not my strength.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Introversion can also involve having a very large, complex &quot;inner life&quot; which makes getting to know new people stressful on a whole different level - are these other people going to Understand my imaginary worlds or make fun of me for them?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This too hits the mark.  Ethan&#39;s imaginary world is huge and ongoing.  It&#39;s was causes him to skip and twirl wherever he goes.  His closest friends are people who also have big imaginary worlds.  I did not consider that it might be a factor in his companion choice.  Maybe that is something he is looking for when he is observing people.  Not sure, but a lightbulb just went off for me here.  The friends that Ethan plays with for the longest are ones that will take a break from games or crafts or whatever to spend some time in imagination.  Then it&#39;s back to the activities, seemingly refueled.  If he can&#39;t get that imagination break, he gets tired, and is done playing.  Very interesting, Meredith.

I do like being with people.  I prefer smaller groups, but I occasionally enjoy larger gatherings for a short time.  I have difficulty with small talk.  I&#39;m a bit awkward.  And, I&#39;m shy.  My son, Ethan, is very much like myself, and I&#39;m having a bit of anxiety about it.  It&#39;s private anxiety, but I&#39;m sure he can sense it too.  <br>\n<br>\nFor many years, I experienced quite a bit of bullying as a young girl in school because of my ways.  I believe this is largely contributing to my anxiety with Ethan.  When I see him acting in ways that are similar to the ways I was as a child, I worry that he is not going to be liked.  I worry that kids will be mean to him.  I don&#39;t think that worry is good for him or me.<br>\n<br>\nLast night we were chatting together as we often do.  We had been at a local park day with a great group of kids earlier that day.  Ethan did not join in with the kids at first because he was waiting for a close friend of his to come.  He doesn&#39;t know the kids from our park day well, because he hasn&#39;t been interested in going to group gatherings.  Lately, however, he has said yes when I&#39;ve asked him if he wanted to go, but I think it is largely because he has a good friend who goes as well.  <br>\n<br>\nAnyway, I tried to encourage him to join in with the other young people, but he didn&#39;t want to.  So, we waited together on the bench with a couple other moms.  I offered to go for a walk with him, play on the playground, swim in the lake, but he wanted to sit with us.  I gave him my phone.  He played with it a bit, but was just as happy to hop, skip, jump and twirl nearby.  I could feel myself wishing he would join the other kids, though I didn&#39;t suggest that again.  I did, however, go over to see what they were up to for a little bit.  <br>\n<br>\nLater his friend arrived.  They played in the lake for good long while.  Then, they both joined the group of kids on a slack line one of the mom&#39;s had thoughtfully brought along with her.  Ethan really enjoyed that.  He did, however, do his own thing there too.  He&#39;s very independent.  <br>\n<br>\nSo...back to chatting.  We were talking about the day a bit, and I asked him why he didn&#39;t want to join in with the other kids.  He said it was because he felt shy.  I said, &quot;Just be yourself.&quot;  He said, &quot;Well, part of being myself is being shy.&quot;  That caused me to pause.  I gave him a big hug and we went on to play a video game together for an hour or two.     <br>\n<br>\nBut, I&#39;ve been thinking all night.  I think I&#39;m stuck and I&#39;m hoping some people will have suggestions for me.  I need to see past my own past experiences to fully support where he is and what he needs for himself, and from me, in social situations. <br>\n<br>\nThanks in advance.

 My heart thumped and started to sink a little as I remembered my own School Days and the way comments like that sounded when I was on the receiving end, but immediately was relieved when my son said (without the least bit of self-consciousness) &quot;I like it&quot; - and the child looked closely at him, smiled, and said &quot;oh - ok!&quot; as she skipped away.</div><div><br></div><div>In my experience, a comment like that was someone looking to start trouble.  In my son&#39;s experience, a simple question was a simple question.  And the other child, whatever her internal motivation for the question, appeared from the outside to have just been curious - no malice intended.</div><div><br></div><div>I remember that day whenever I&#39;m inspired to worry for a moment about whether my son &quot;fits in&quot; or whether he&#39;s &quot;different.&quot;  We&#39;re all different - even if those of us who went to school didn&#39;t always get the best, most positive messages about our differences :-)  But our unschooled kids aren&#39;t living in that world - aren&#39;t dealing with what happens when kids are grouped together in big classes and on big playgrounds at recess, left to mostly fend for themselves socially and with their peers.  Our unschooled kids have us as sounding boards, and as navigational partners as they make their way through the social waters.  And that&#39;s pretty awesome, I think.  I can&#39;t wait to see how our kids will be as adults - adults whose experiences will be different than ours - whose experiences allow them to hear &quot;what&#39;s with the hat?&quot;

do - etc. &nbsp;What a difference from school groupings, where kids are forced to associate and to figure out how to be together for long periods of time whether they like each other or not, whether they&#39;re tired and hungry or not, etc.!</div><div><br></div><div>Having been to public school all my school years, and then taught in a variety of preschool programs while I was in college and in the years immediately following, I find it seriously remarkable, what happens in groups of non-schooled kids vs what happens in groups of schooled kids.</div><div><br></div><div>Even preschoolers in a classroom setting seem to notice and single out those who are Different - who are quiet - who dress their own way or play their own way and don&#39;t fit immediately and easily into The Group. &nbsp;And the older those kids get, the more Different seems to become Negative in the eyes of other kids.</div><div><br></div><div>But in kids who&#39;ve never been to school - who&#39;ve never struggled for pecking order within a group of same-age peers - I find it remarkable (and fantastic!) that, at least in the groups we&#39;ve participated in, that just doesn&#39;t seem to be what happens.</div><div><br></div><div>Not all the kids we know get along perfectly or are best friends - not at all. &nbsp;But they don&#39;t pick on and ostracize and act unpleasantly toward those they don&#39;t have as much in common with - they seem to let each other Be and let each other go their own way and do their own thing.</div><div><br></div><div>I remember a day early on when we started going to beach days with one of our local groups. &nbsp;My son *always* wore his floppy green hat to beach days (still does :-) as he doesn&#39;t like sun in his eyes, and prefers a hat to sunglasses). &nbsp;One of the little girls he&#39;d just met a few weeks earlier walked up to him, and said &quot;what&#39;s with the hat?&quot; &nbsp;My heart thumped and started to sink a little as I remembered my own School Days and the way comments like that sounded when I was on the receiving end, but immediately was relieved when my son said (without the least bit of self-consciousness) &quot;I like it&quot; - and the child looked closely at him, smiled, and said &quot;oh - ok!&quot; as she skipped away.</div><div><br></div><div>In my experience, a comment like that was someone looking to start trouble. &nbsp;In my son&#39;s experience, a simple question was a simple question. &nbsp;And the other child, whatever her internal motivation for the question, appeared from the outside to have just been curious - no malice intended.</div><div><br></div><div>I remember that day whenever I&#39;m inspired to worry for a moment about whether my son &quot;fits in&quot; or whether he&#39;s &quot;different.&quot; &nbsp;We&#39;re all different - even if those of us who went to school didn&#39;t always get the best, most positive messages about our differences :-) &nbsp;But our unschooled kids aren&#39;t living in that world - aren&#39;t dealing with what happens when kids are grouped together in big classes and on big playgrounds at recess, left to mostly fend for themselves socially and with their peers. &nbsp;Our unschooled kids have us as sounding boards, and as navigational partners as they make their way through the social waters. &nbsp;And that&#39;s pretty awesome, I think. &nbsp;I can&#39;t wait to see how our kids will be as adults - adults whose experiences will be different than ours - whose experiences allow them to hear &quot;what&#39;s with the hat?&quot; as a friendly inquiry and not a challenge to their fashion sense or anything else :-)</div><div><br></div><div>Colleen &nbsp;</div><style

I do like being with people.  I prefer smaller groups, but I occasionally enjoy larger gatherings for a short time.  I have difficulty with small talk.  I&#39;m a bit awkward.  And, I&#39;m shy.  My son, Ethan, is very much like myself, and I&#39;m having a bit of anxiety about it.  It&#39;s private anxiety, but I&#39;m sure he can sense it too.  <br>\n\n<br>\nFor many years, I experienced quite a bit of bullying as a young girl in school because of my ways.  I believe this is largely contributing to my anxiety with Ethan.  When I see him acting in ways that are similar to the ways I was as a child, I worry that he is not going to be liked.  I worry that kids will be mean to him.  I don&#39;t think that worry is good for him or me.<br>\n\n<br>\nLast night we were chatting together as we often do.  We had been at a local park day with a great group of kids earlier that day.  Ethan did not join in with the kids at first because he was waiting for a close friend of his to come.  He doesn&#39;t know the kids from our park day well, because he hasn&#39;t been interested in going to group gatherings.  Lately, however, he has said yes when I&#39;ve asked him if he wanted to go, but I think it is largely because he has a good friend who goes as well.  <br>\n\n<br>\nAnyway, I tried to encourage him to join in with the other young people, but he didn&#39;t want to.  So, we waited together on the bench with a couple other moms.  I offered to go for a walk with him, play on the playground, swim in the lake, but he wanted to sit with us.  I gave him my phone.  He played with it a bit, but was just as happy to hop, skip, jump and twirl nearby.  I could feel myself wishing he would join the other kids, though I didn&#39;t suggest that again.  I did, however, go over to see what they were up to for a little bit.  <br>\n\n<br>\nLater his friend arrived.  They played in the lake for good long while.  Then, they both joined the group of kids on a slack line one of the mom&#39;s had thoughtfully brought along with her.  Ethan really enjoyed that.  He did, however, do his own thing there too.  He&#39;s very independent.  <br>\n\n<br>\nSo...back to chatting.  We were talking about the day a bit, and I asked him why he didn&#39;t want to join in with the other kids.  He said it was because he felt shy.  I said, &quot;Just be yourself.&quot;  He said, &quot;Well, part of being myself is being shy.&quot;  That caused me to pause.  I gave him a big hug and we went on to play a video game together for an hour or two.     <br>\n\n<br>\nBut, I&#39;ve been thinking all night.  I think I&#39;m stuck and I&#39;m hoping some people will have suggestions for me.

I have","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1200150638\">I am a very introverted person.  I do like being with people.  I prefer smaller groups, but I occasionally enjoy larger gatherings for a short time.  I have difficulty with small talk.  I&#39;m a bit awkward.  And, I&#39;m shy.  My son, Ethan, is very much like myself, and I&#39;m having a bit of anxiety about it.  It&#39;s private anxiety, but I&#39;m sure he can sense it too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor many years, I experienced quite a bit of bullying as a young girl in school because of my ways.  I believe this is largely contributing to my anxiety with Ethan.  When I see him acting in ways that are similar to the ways I was as a child, I worry that he is not going to be liked.  I worry that kids will be mean to him.  I don&#39;t think that worry is good for him or me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we were chatting together as we often do.  We had been at a local park day with a great group of kids earlier that day.  Ethan did not join in with the kids at first because he was waiting for a close friend of his to come.  He doesn&#39;t know the kids from our park day well, because he hasn&#39;t been interested in going to group gatherings.  Lately, however, he has said yes when I&#39;ve asked him if he wanted to go, but I think it is largely because he has a good friend who goes as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I tried to encourage him to join in with the other young people, but he didn&#39;t want to.  So, we waited together on the bench with a couple other moms.  I offered to go for a walk with him, play on the playground, swim in the lake, but he wanted to sit with us.  I gave him my phone.  He played with it a bit, but was just as happy to hop, skip, jump and twirl nearby.  I could feel myself wishing he would join the other kids, though I didn&#39;t suggest that again.  I did, however, go over to see what they were up to for a little bit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater his friend arrived.  They played in the lake for good long while.  Then, they both joined the group of kids on a slack line one of the mom&#39;s had thoughtfully brought along with her.  Ethan really enjoyed that.  He did, however, do his own thing there too.  He&#39;s very independent.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo...back to chatting.  We were talking about the day a bit, and I asked him why he didn&#39;t want to join in with the other kids.  He said it was because he felt shy.  I said, &quot;Just be yourself.&quot;  He said, &quot;Well, part of being myself is being shy.&quot;  That caused me to pause.  I gave him a big hug and we went on to play a video game together for an hour or two.     <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I&#39;ve been thinking all night.  I think I&#39;m stuck and I&#39;m hoping some people will have suggestions for me.  I need to see past my own past experiences to fully support where he is and what he needs for himself, and from me, in social situations. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.  (Sorry if this is a bit wordy.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":72135,"nextTopicId":72193}}
