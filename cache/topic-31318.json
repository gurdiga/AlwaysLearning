I would not advocate forbidding them the<br/>\nfoods they crave (and if it is biochemical, it will come with cravings and<br/>\nwithdrawals as well). That will just make them sneak and they *will* sneak<br/>\nif it is forbidden. However, I do think there is value in letting them know<br/>\nthat there may be a connection and seeing if you can find one.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter has a sensitivity to Red Dye.  When she has had some (and it<br/>\ntakes very little to &quot;wind her up&quot;) she gets really angry really easily.<br/>\nWhen we first discovered this we talked with her about it. After I had kept<br/>\na journal for several weeks and tried many different things with her (that<br/>\nwere non food related) we finally explained to her what we thought was the<br/>\ncause of her anger.  She was 3 1/2 at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe took the red dye out of her diet.  On a couple occassions she did eat<br/>\nsome things with red dye in it and without warning, within an hour or two<br/>\nthe littlest thing was setting her off and her anger was to the point of<br/>\nhitting, biting, etc.  I took her in my arms and explained to her that we<br/>\nbelieved the way she was feeling at the moment was due to the Red Dye that<br/>\nshe had gotten and I would hold her until she was calm and/or ready to get<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we don&#39;t really tell her she can&#39;t have things, but we will inform her<br/>\nthat there is red dye in them.  She willingly traded all her halloween candy<br/>\nthat potentially had red dye in it for things that didn&#39;t.  She doesn&#39;t try<br/>\nto sneak, but I don&#39;t think she craves it either.  We also provide and keep<br/>\non hand at all times, food that does not have red dye in it.  We have gum<br/>\nand suckers in the car (you know those bank ladies like to give out suckers<br/>\n:) and we take peanuts to the movie theatre instead of popcorn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason behind me even investigating the &quot;red dye&quot; issue was because of<br/>\nhow much it hurt my heart to watch her be in so much apparent pain while she<br/>\nwas angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRoger, Amanda, Marti and Lilly<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I have never let my schooling interfere with my education&quot; -Mark Twain<br/>\n<br/>\n1/2 Price Slide shows make GREAT Christmas Presents!<br/>\nExample Slide shows at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://server3.inalbum.com/ia30/show/choose2bgr8/\">http://server3.inalbum.com/ia30/show/choose2bgr8/</a><br/>\nSee my pictures at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.HopesCreations.com\">http://www.HopesCreations.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com/gallery/\">http://choose2bgr8.deviantart.com/gallery/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":31295,"nextTopicId":31323}}
