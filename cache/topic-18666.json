Music has always been a huge help, even for short drives around <br/>\ntown.  Sometimes on longer drives we listen to books on tape.  We&#39;ve had a <br/>\nlot of fun lately playing &quot;animal, vegetable, or mineral.&quot;  If it&#39;s a short <br/>\ndrive, we might get in only two or three games; we&#39;ve played it as long as <br/>\nhalf an hour on other occasions.<br/>\n______<br/>\nSo if anyone has any other car game ideas to pass the time I need some more<br/>\nideas.  Somehow I seem to be drawing a blank on this...  Perhaps I grew up<br/>\nin a &quot;Dad expects us to sit quietly in the back seat&quot; family because I<br/>\ncan&#39;t think of a single thing that I used to have fun with in the car when<br/>\nI was a kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nLet the new MSN Premium Internet Software make the most of your high-speed <br/>\nexperience. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/prem&ST=1\">http://join.msn.com/?pgmarket=en-us&page=byoa/prem&ST=1</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18464,"nextTopicId":18630}}
