When kids aren&#39;t in school, that can feel awkward - what the heck do you say to a child other than &quot;what are you doing in school?&quot; Especially if you only see him twice a year? It can leave extended family members stymied. So it helps a whoooole lot to feed them useful information and conversation starters in the form of something grandparents usually like anyway - pictures and stories of their grandkids. Keeping a blog or sending regular notes (via facebook or plain old snail mail) goes a long way in that regard. And! they get to see their beloved grandchildren happy and adventurous, which can help to reassure them on that score.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling can come across as some kind of weird cult if you try to explain it from a theoretical side first. Start with happy kids living rich, full lives and school starts to seem less of an issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only site I sent my parents when I was getting into unschooling was actually a homeschooling site - A to Zs Home&#39;s Cool.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/\">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a><br/>\n Its a huuuuuge site and that alone brought a big sigh of relief from my family.

It really seems that fulltime homeschooling/unschooling is the answer for me but I will continue to research.<br/>\nThat said- can anyone link me to some good research demonstrating how good homeschoolers/unschoolers do? This is not for me at all just for &#39;concerned&#39; family members. It seems that HSers do great in college, in jobs, in life in general...Is there any good &#39;research&#39; online to back this up?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would really love but we a good DVD to watch with my wife. She always gets alot out of documentaries. Is there any good ones about HSing/USing? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow bout any good information (dvd would be great) on why compulsory schooling is bad? I haven&#39;t really come up with any yet though someone just recommended Waiting For Superman...so maybe that is good...but Id really like a harsh critique of the foundation/maintenance/results of compulsory schooling...and it doesn&#39;t have to be an academic critique at all (but fine if it is). Maybe just a look at competition, bullying, sexism, racism and devaluization of life that is entrenched in alot of our school systems structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny good resources on any of this anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all tons!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60809,"nextTopicId":60915}}
