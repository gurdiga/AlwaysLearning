It resonates in some way.  Taking geometry for example, she <br/>\nactually already knows geometry (well, at least as well as your average <br/>\nhigh schooler).

She disappeared with it <br/>\nfor about 2 weeks and emerged saying that she finished it and it was really <br/>\na lot like Algebra.  I think maybe it&#39;s that she can&#39;t *see* that she&#39;s <br/>\nlearned it.  She didn&#39;t get an A/B/C/D or a gold star for what she did.  I <br/>\nmade appreciative comments, but I&#39;m &#39;just mom&#39; in many respects.  I had an <br/>\nunschooling local friend ask me if maybe I shouldn&#39;t make up some <br/>\ncertificates of accomplishment every now and then when she does something <br/>\nlike this.  I&#39;m torn on the matter because of the whole &#39;punishing by <br/>\nrewards&#39; mentality it re-inforces.

One is 16, Rachael, awesome (of course), who was in a <br/>\n&#39;progressive&#39; private school (her decision) until 8th grade, then a charter <br/>\nhigh for a few months, and is now unschooling her high school years.  The <br/>\nsecond kid, Damian is 13, in seventh grade at the same &#39;progressive&#39; <br/>\nprivate school in 7th grade (it goes to 8th), is dyslexic so he writes <br/>\nextremely slowly but loves the school for its Acivities (he&#39;s making <br/>\nchainmail at the moment) and his friends there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamian was having a meltdown a few months back over homework he wasn&#39;t able <br/>\nto get done in time - and he was exhausted, it was late, etc, etc.  I wrote <br/>\non his homework that I was not going to require him to do homework during <br/>\nfamily time and at Damian&#39;s request, wrote another note saying that this <br/>\nidea was mine, not Damians.  (He wanted the teacher to not get mad at <br/>\nhim.)  I later confirmed with the teacher that life was okay with this <br/>\ndecision and she made some murmurings about it being alright and that <br/>\nthey&#39;d find a way to get the work done in school or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just found out how she&#39;s been getting her work done.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s been keeping Damian in during lunch EVERY SINGLE DAY to get his &#39;LATE <br/>\nWORK&#39; done.  He can&#39;t remember the last time he had a lunch free.  Every <br/>\nsingle day his friends from 7th and 8th grade have been gathering on the <br/>\nsteps to chat, reconnect, plan after-school activities and eat their <br/>\nlunches... and Damian&#39;s been kept inside.  I just had a <br/>\ntrying-to-be-nonchalant-but-not-very-effectively chat with the boy about it <br/>\nand he seems to feel that he NEEDS to do the homework because otherwise <br/>\nhe&#39;s not going to learn anything and he wants to be successful with his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m about to scream with rage and frustration, not at the boy, but at the <br/>\nteacher and the stupid ficking society that says homework is more important <br/>\nthan family, friends, activities and that if it&#39;s not done, a kid will be <br/>\nstupid and not have a good life.  Never MIND that it&#39;s costing an arm and a <br/>\nleg to keep him in the stupid fricking school too!<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to pull him immediately, even though it&#39;s his choice to BE at that <br/>\nschool because that viewpoint is so whacked out I can hardly stand it.  I <br/>\nwant to un-brainwash him!   I want an intervention!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to honor his wishes to stay with his friends at the school, but I <br/>\nalso don&#39;t know how much of that desire is prompted by the idea that if <br/>\nhe&#39;s not &#39;taught&#39;, he won&#39;t learn anything, so he needs a &#39;teacher&#39;, <br/>\ncomplete with homework.<br/>\n<br/>\nIntending to bolster the argument about not needing homework and the joys <br/>\nof unschooling, I asked Rachael to talk about how she&#39;s doing with the <br/>\nunschooling thing and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t agree with having homework, but <br/>\nI&#39;m learning jack-shit.&quot;  Blew me out of the water.  Here&#39;s a bright, <br/>\nintelligent girl who can dye hair almost any color (usually a bright one), <br/>\ncan build webpages, work with digital images, handle more than 5 chat rooms <br/>\nat a time, taught herself to knit, planned her own trip to Oregon on <br/>\nAmtrak, including paying for it... and all she can say is that she doesn&#39;t <br/>\nknow geometry well enough.  I ask her why she thinks she&#39;ll need geometry <br/>\nand can&#39;t she brush up on it when she really needs it and she just <br/>\nshrugs.  Meanwhile her brother is sitting there just nodding his head, <br/>\nsaying, &quot;see what I mean?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I finally told them that they had <br/>\nblown me out of the water and I needed a little while alone to write to you <br/>\nguys and figure out what is going on (and maybe even get some suggestions <br/>\non how to handle it.)  I also wasn&#39;t the coolest because I just went inside <br/>\nto find Rae with one of her unschooling buddies (my honorary second <br/>\ndaughter) and I blew up, asking the buddy to explain to Rae how bright and <br/>\nintelligent she is and how few other kids would be able to manage to get <br/>\nthemselves up to Oregon and back again successfully on their own, yadda, <br/>\nyadda, yadda.  I then proceeded to burst into tears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWay to stay cool, mom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any ideas?<br/>\nHeidi-the-blown-away-and-seriously-mind-ficked...<br/>\nWhere is my Tahitian island when I need it?</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67247159,"authorName":"Nanci Kuykendall","from":"Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@...&gt;","profile":"aisliin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Hey Cheryl","postDate":"1042571605","msgId":11707,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMTE0MTkxMzI1Ljc0MTU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjEzNzAyLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNDIzNTAyOTUuMTg4MC42OTQ0MS5tMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11709,"prevInTime":11706,"nextInTime":11708,"topicId":11707,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
