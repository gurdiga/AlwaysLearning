From here down is quoted from Section V of the article Spanking Hurts Everybody, by Robert R. Gillogly.  (There is also a Section VI.... there&#39;s more there.)<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSpanking is primarily an adult or parental problem. When the spanking situation is analyzed, in nearly every incident there is a personal problem of parents who resorted to the use of the &quot;rod.&quot; It was really the adult ego that had been defied, an adult order disobeyed, an adult request denied, adult authority challenged, adult pride or adult respect offended.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more one reflects on the popular practice of spanking, the more ridiculous the tragicomedy is revealed. A number of strange parenting contradictions become apparent. For example, aside from the obvious contradiction involved in hitting children for hitting each other, and telling them to &quot;Stop your hitting!&quot; one of the most ludicrous contradictions is to spank a child until it cries, for if it doesn&#39;t cry it hasn&#39;t been disciplined properly-it hasn&#39;t experienced enough pain to learn the lesson-and then tell it to stop crying or it&#39;ll get another spanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother child rearing non sequitur surrounds the statement, &quot;I am spanking you for your own good!&quot; as if children are like Al Capp&#39;s &quot;Schmoos,&quot; and love to be spanked. There is even a parenting primer entitled Spank Me if You Love Me based on the premise that spanking is a demonstration of care and should be administered lovingly. If true for children, why not similarly demonstrate our care and affection for our spouses and friends by spanking them? But that would be called assault and battery. Do we stop loving when we stop spanking? Does he who spanks hardest love best? When does a child deserve to be loved and disciplined, that is, spanked-three months, six months, nine months? When does a child outgrow the need? Obviously, when they have outgrown the spanking parent. As has been intimated earlier, very few six-feet, two-hundred pound children need to be spanked, even though their behavior may evoke the same frustrations in the parent as does the behavior of smaller siblings. Of course, size and strength, according to spanking parents, is supposed to have nothing whatsoever to do with who is or who is not spanked. And, of course, it is a child rearing contradiction of the first order for a parent to say &quot;I&#39;ll teach you to pick on someone smaller than you; pick on someone your own size!&quot; as the parent strikes the little bully who had provoked, poked, or punched-out his little sister. In effect, we punish him for learning his lesson from adults so thoroughly. Yet parents are shocked in watching their own children mimic their own actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is terrifying to observe how parental practices are reflected in children&#39;s games and their interaction with siblings, peers, pets and even toys. &quot;You&#39;re a bad boy!&quot; Spank, spank. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t do that! Naughty girl!&quot; Spank, spank. We see in our children the quality of our parental example. For better or worse, the cycle tends to repeat itself in the next generation. The fact is we consistently do unto them what in no way would we tolerate being done unto us and we consistently do unto them what we in no way Would tolerate them doing unto one another.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110927212750/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm\">http://web.archive.org/web/20110927212750/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1981/v37-4-article1.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] don&#39;t settle for better","postDate":"1360799868","msgId":70530,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNjA3OTk4NjguNjMxMjUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDkwNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDJDMEI4MzE1LUU0NTAtNENFOS1BMjU2LTY2ODkzOTk5N0RGQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDJDMEI4MzE1LUU0NTAtNENFOS1BMjU2LTY2ODkzOTk5N0RGQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70528,"nextInTopic":70533,"prevInTime":70529,"nextInTime":70531,"topicId":70526,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I am choosing to unschool, but my parenting with structure and gentle nudging will not change.*** I m not sure that it s possible to unschool and not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-316223409\">***I am choosing to unschool, but my parenting with structure and gentle nudging will not change.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s possible to unschool and not change.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even possible to parent and not change.  It seems impossible to do the same things over and over while children change and grow bigger and older.  If this person has very very compliant children, I suppose it&#39;s possible?  Some of the very best things that I&#39;ve done as a person and parent have been exactly because I changed and grew when I needed to, to make the lives of my children better.  The things I regret are the things that I thought I knew best and wasn&#39;t flexible enough to change.  The things I don&#39;t regret at all are the things I&#39;ve changed because they&#39;ve all been in the direction of better.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Sometimes &quot;better&quot; isn&#39;t much progress at all.***<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the bar is set really low.  Thanks for keeping it set high!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":363518215,"authorName":"Claire","from":"&quot;Claire&quot; &lt;claire.horsley08@...&gt;","profile":"claire.horsley08","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: don&#39;t settle for better","postDate":"1360796736","msgId":70528,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGtmaDY4MCtzbGU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJDMEI4MzE1LUU0NTAtNENFOS1BMjU2LTY2ODkzOTk5N0RGQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":70526,"nextInTopic":70530,"prevInTime":70527,"nextInTime":70529,"topicId":70526,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Openness to at least consider the ideas. &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember clearly when I read here 5 years ago that in order to truly give kids a choice, a parent may end up packing up the toys EVERY SINGLE TIME. &quot;Oh no way&quot;, I thought. Ha! Guess what I&#39;ve been doing most days for the last 4 years and 11 months. I decided that if I didn&#39;t feel like packing up the toys, I&#39;d just go ahead and LEAVE them on the floor. It&#39;s so cool that for the past 5 years, my kids have experienced zero angst about packing up. Think of all the kids out there who&#39;ve been harangued for YEARS about something that could be a total non-issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s horrible to read that someone is &quot;choosing to unschool, but my parenting will not change&quot;. Unschooling changed my parenting so much. Unschooling changed me! I am more confident, more at peace with myself, more loving, more patient. My children&#39;s happiness and incredible learning are the evidence that over the last 5 years my parenting has continued to improve, but they also provide instant feedback on where I can do better.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew ideas can be confronting, admitting error is hard, but I&#39;d much rather being open to ideas and my own mistakes than being stuck and atrophying ... and worse, inflicting my faulty thinking on my kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nClaire</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"don&#39;t settle for better","postDate":"1360783833","msgId":70526,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDJDMEI4MzE1LUU0NTAtNENFOS1BMjU2LTY2ODkzOTk5N0RGQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":70528,"prevInTime":70525,"nextInTime":70527,"topicId":70526,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Better is better, I ve always said.

Sometimes &quot;better&quot; isn&#39;t much progress at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone wrote and wrote too much on the facebook group. She said clearly that she was needing help with deschooling but in another thread, two things she wrote are here:  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to advise a mom who had a shy son: <br/>\n<br/>\n-=- for better or worse, that there have been occasions where I&#39;ve signed up my son for something despite his protests, with the promise that if he tries it and doesn&#39;t like it, then I won&#39;t make him do it again. And I&#39;ve had to define what counts as trying (say one hour of a class) so he can&#39;t say after 2 minutes he doesn&#39;t like it. This has been the less pleasant way for him than observing first, but there are things he has agreed to try and now loves doing.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mom suggested the son might be learning unintended things, and the no-deschooled mom wrote something long, containing this:<br/>\n<br/>\n -=-You also do not know that my children have an abusive controlling father with whom I am divorced, and believe me, my children understand full well the difference between his forceful controlling parenting and my loving gentle parenting.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the side, where I was trying to explain the situation, and to calm her, she wrote (among other things):  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=- So yes I will read the guidelines first, although in my defense I did not fully know what radical unschooling is. I am choosing to unschool, but my parenting with structure and gentle nudging will not change. It seems that your group has different views than I on this.

And at least one person (the mom) is being less abused (with a divorce).   But the kids are with the dad sometimes, probably, and the mom is self-congratulatory about being less controlling and less abusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of my response:  <br/>\n++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/s/rod\">http://sandradodd.com/s/rod</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you believe is biblical is not in the Bible.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- in my defense I did not fully know what radical unschooling is-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is not AT ALL a defense, as links to my site and Joyce&#39;s are in the group description and the pinned-to-the-top post for new members has a link to my help page.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that means you posted AND GAVE ADVICE without reading the introduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you post advice on a Silverado repair discussion and then defend yourself with &quot;I didn&#39;t fully know what a Silverado was&quot;? <br/>\n+++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nEver-improving, ever better must be the &quot;better&quot; I mean when I say better is better.  <br/>\nMindful better.<br/>\nPeaceful better.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70513,"nextTopicId":70540}}
