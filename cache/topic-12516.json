Here s a copy of the letter I send to the Editor in response to the article that was posted here earlier and appeared in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-873990736\">Don&#39;t get me started Heidi (LOL).... Here&#39;s a copy of the letter I send to<br/>\nthe Editor in response to the article that was posted here earlier and<br/>\nappeared in the Arizona Daily Star.  I&#39;m afraid once I say something I don&#39;t<br/>\nstop...  but maybe it would be a good idea to say something on that<br/>\nunschooling list.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolding parents to the same standards that apply to public schools,<br/>\nespecially when it comes to student achievement testing is not logical.  If<br/>\nschools are failing to meet &quot;testing guidelines&quot; is there a suggestion that<br/>\nwe as home-schooling parents lower our children to the level of those that<br/>\ngo to schools that are failing?  How is that beneficial to our children?<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting is about proving that teachers are actually working, when in fact if<br/>\nthe results are so bad why aren&#39;t we firing all these teachers because they<br/>\nare obviously not doing their job.  As parents we don&#39;t have to prove<br/>\nanything to anyone.  We are not paid to teach our children and they learn<br/>\nanyway.  Teachers want to teach but with all the bureaucratic rubbish they<br/>\nhave to handle and the &quot;problem children&quot; they have to deal with when do<br/>\nthey find time to teach.\t<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools don&#39;t teach children what they need to know in the &quot;real&quot; world.  In<br/>\nthe &quot;real&quot; world we need to know how to be in healthy, appropriate<br/>\nrelationships with people of all ages.  Does school teach that?  No it<br/>\nteaches children that it&#39;s important to do what others do, whether that is<br/>\nbullying other children verbally or physically or looking down on others who<br/>\nare not willing to be in a popularity contest.  It keeps all children of the<br/>\nsame age together, thereby not allowing children to experience what it&#39;s<br/>\nlike in the &quot;real&quot; world to have friends of a variety of ages.  Last time I<br/>\nchecked with my 5 closest friends they ranged in age from 26 - 54 and I&#39;m<br/>\n43.  In school I would never have known these people.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen checking with universities such as Harvard and Stanford I have read<br/>\nthey prefer children who&#39;ve been home-schooled, saying &quot;these kids are so<br/>\nmuch more self directed and pay little to no attention to the peer pressure<br/>\nthe regularly schooled kids do&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor many people the &quot;real&quot; world does not consist of 1 brick building<br/>\ncomplex that we spend all day in.  For those of us that have chosen<br/>\nself-employment, which is rising by leaps and bounds each year, we spend our<br/>\ntime moving from house to store to outside to be with our children, to<br/>\nmuseums, to meetings with others.  Very different from how most of us spent<br/>\nour childhood.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever I read an article in the Arizona Daily Star about home-schooling,<br/>\nreligion is invariably mentioned.  What about those of us that home-school<br/>\nour children because we don&#39;t want our children to be locked up in a room of<br/>\n30 kids all day, being force fed information they may or may not need in<br/>\ntheir lifetime.  What about those of us that believe children, as adults do,<br/>\nlearn what they want to learn when they want to learn it and are quite<br/>\ncapable of asking for help when needed.  What about those of us that are<br/>\nwilling to spend time with our children to help them discover and support<br/>\nthose subjects they love.  What about those us that want our children to<br/>\ngrow and learn at their own pace and not be compared to anyone else<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it that the Arizona Daily Star has a business expert writing business<br/>\ncolumns, a gardening expert writing gardening information but the person who<br/>\nwrites articles about home-schooling has neither been home-schooled<br/>\nthemselves nor home-schools their own children? (Jennifer doesn&#39;t actually<br/>\nhave any children come to that)  Doesn&#39;t it make more sense to have someone<br/>\nwho has first hand knowledge of home-schooling write about the issue?  Or,<br/>\nis there a fear that the person writing might have more positive ideas and<br/>\nthoughts to convey about home-schooling, thereby making parents and others<br/>\nquestion the veracity of the educational system in this country and the<br/>\nchoices they are making as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 24<br/>\n   Date: Tue, 25 Feb 2003 16:43:04 -0800<br/>\n   From: Heidi Wordhouse-Dykema &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:heidi@...\">heidi@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: Re: This list<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;  It actually annoys me to be on an unschooling<br/>\n&gt;list and then hear people talking about how many worksheets they are <br/>\n&gt;giving<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Have you considered posting and expressing that annoyance?
