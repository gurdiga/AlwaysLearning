Some people jump in a pool and just swim, they didn&#39;t need lessons<br/>\nin particular, and their way of getting to the other end of the pool is just<br/>\nfine, even if it doesn&#39;t look like my way. If they&#39;re not drowning, they&#39;re<br/>\nswimming. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling in my family is partly how we are with each other and would<br/>\n(hopefully) still be with each other if our girls were in school: calm,<br/>\nrespectful, encouraging. It is partly what we actually do for and with the<br/>\ngirls: helping to find resources as needed or requested, keeping an eye out<br/>\nfor things the other people in the family might find exciting or useful,<br/>\ncoming to each others aid when its needed, even when not specifically asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that my daughters are growing up, they are almost as likely to find<br/>\nthings that are of use to me as Wally or I are to find things that are of<br/>\nuse to them. I am hopeless with most of the electronic gadgets in the house.<br/>\nMy eleven year old cheerfully sets up DVR recordings for me, shows me<br/>\npatiently (for the 10th time) how do do certain things on the computer, etc.<br/>\nWhat has gone around here, has come around. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is about and should be about choices. A family who is Christian<br/>\nand tells their children they cannot associate with the heathens down the<br/>\nblock is denying choices as surely as an unschooling family who tells their<br/>\nchildren that they may not, under any circumstances, attend a school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure what third world countries have to do with it. :) If a mother<br/>\nor father or child who is from a third world country makes it into my<br/>\ngeneral orbit and wants to ask me unschooling questions, I&#39;d be happy to<br/>\nanswer them to the best of my ability. Otherwise, it just seems a de-railing<br/>\nsort of side topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23482,"nextTopicId":23483}}
