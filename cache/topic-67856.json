(Rhetorical)<br/>\n<br/>\nI might have ignored the whole thing (just let it play out) - because he<br/>\nwasn&#39;t asking them for anything.

I think I&#39;d most<br/>\nlikely have handled it by going over to him (when he was calling to the<br/>\nother kids) and saying, &quot;Let them finish their popsicles, then maybe<br/>\nthey&#39;ll be ready to play again. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go ....whatever...climb a<br/>\ntree, jump in the leaves, etc.&quot; If he didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d probably very<br/>\nlightly just say, &quot;Okay - well that&#39;s fine just don&#39;t bug them about the<br/>\npopsicles, okay?&quot; And he&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m NOT&quot; and I&#39;d say, &quot;That&#39;s good.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I felt deeply discouraged about my own parenting reading this, and I<br/>\n&gt; feel the same way when I read disbelief that I didn&#39;t apologize in the<br/>\n&gt; moment.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Deep discouragement seems a little much as a response to some stranger on<br/>\nthe internet, but if it is because you, yourself, had a realization about<br/>\nhow much better you could be doing, then great!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone once said to me that I was oddly happy to have to wear glasses.<br/>\nThis person said she hated wearing glasses.

We ate snacks together and ended up down at the creek. Soon after we began playing there, two other families showed up with six children between them, ages 6 to 9, maybe. Our kids played on the edge of this group happily for about an hour, and then a third mom joined their group, and she had brought Popsicles for all of them. They didn&#39;t offer our kids any, so our kids kind of wandered back to us. Then, my son, who&#39;s 6 1/2, walked back close-ish to their group and shouted to get their attention, then asked what they planned on doing after they ate their Popsicles. I suspected by his body language and his tone of voice that he was really wanting to be offered a Popsicle, but the other kids didn&#39;t answer anyway. I asked him to come back toward me, then asked him quietly to stop trying to get their attention and to let them eat their Popsicles.
