I was studying to be a teacher  <br/>\nand was SURE school was IT on a stick and that school reform was  <br/>\nsurely about to make the garden of Eden out of the wasteland that  <br/>\nschool was clearly becoming.<br/>\n<br/>\nooops.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when I started unschooling I called Nada and said &quot;I was so wrong,  <br/>\nand it&#39;s easy and it&#39;s legal.  Unfortunately, by then Paul was about  <br/>\nto be out of school, or was out.   She took one of his younger  <br/>\nbrothers out that week.   I felt HORRIBLE, and rightly so.  So I  <br/>\nresolved that as penance for having prevented a family of five kids  <br/>\nfrom having been homeschooled, I had to go out and try to save at  <br/>\nleast five kids from being schooled.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen after a while I was just having fun, and meeting other  <br/>\nunschoolers I really enjoyed working with (online, in our word-work),  <br/>\nand  here I still am.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this year started I made a resolution to do more, and I have  <br/>\nbeen.   I figure I should make my site really solid and useful enough  <br/>\nthat it will be helpful after I&#39;m gone, and I should encourage others  <br/>\nto help freely too.

This isn&#39;t a passing fancy, but has held their interest for at<br/>\nleast 2 years. &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE Pokemon stories!  Pokemon was so huge in my daughter&#39;s life.  It<br/>\nled to everything that she&#39;s into now.  She still holds a special place<br/>\nin her heart for all things Pokemon.  She seems to connect with others<br/>\nthat were the same way, even if they aren&#39;t now still into Pokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike your kids, Pokemon was such an intense passion for my daughter.  It<br/>\nled to other anime, other manga, pets, video games, fashion, Japanese<br/>\nculture, horror movies, make-up, music.  Like branches of a tree, it<br/>\nkept sprouting out new ideas and interests.  That one passion evolved<br/>\nand changed and grew up with my daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s amazing how one seemingly small passion can evolve into something<br/>\nhuge and life changing that leads to everything else in the world!  I<br/>\nlove this about unschooling, EVERYthing counts, especially the seemingly<br/>\nsmall things!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Pokemon and learning stuff that didn&#39;t even seem possible 5 minutes ago","postDate":"1240498862","msgId":44223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA1NDhGQzQ5LUE4RDQtNDNCNS1BM0U0LUVBRUNDMzIzN0EzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdzb2xsMis3bTFmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdzb2xsMis3bTFmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44220,"nextInTopic":44224,"prevInTime":44222,"nextInTime":44224,"topicId":44220,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-With the internet, there is certainly a lot of garbage out there, but there are also people, like people on this list, who are intensely interested in","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-496121660\">-=-With the internet, there is certainly a lot of garbage out there,  <br/>\nbut there are also people, like people on this list, who are intensely  <br/>\ninterested in passing along the things that they are passionate about,  <br/>\nhave learned, the problems that they have encountered and roads not to  <br/>\ntake, intended to inform and take the scary stuff out of learning  <br/>\nsomething new.

I have 2 boys, 10 and 7, who are INTENSELY interested in all things Pokemon.  This isn&#39;t a passing fancy, but has held their interest for at least 2 years.  It started with first watching the cartoon, then getting the GBA and then the Nintendo DS (we now have the newest DSIs as well), and finding as many used and new Pokemon games for Gameboy and DS as were available, playing those games for so many hours, that you might think that was all they did for 2 years :) Pouring through the manuals, collecting sticker books and cards, and all sorts of toys, etc.  Well, this week, suddenly it was proclaimed that it was finished, that all the games had been played to the furthest extent possible and nothing more could be done (one boy had obtained Action Replay, used all the cheats, all sorts of cheats had been researched on-line, including watching countless Youtube videos on this topic, etc.).  It was announced to me by youngest boy that the only thing to be done was for us to create our own Pokemon game!  He tells me &quot;hacking Pokemon&quot; must be learned immediately.  I am not a techie by any stretch.  The thought of figuring this out, for me, was daunting, to say the least.  Frankly, I was tempted to crawl under my chair and hide.  DH is the tech guy in this family, but he is at work during the day, and kids were chomping at the bit for this information early in the a.m.  I didn&#39;t think I would be able to make it through an entire day with their intense desire unless I figured out a way to get past my comfort zone.  I was really not sure at all that I would be able to figure out any of it, and I told them going in that I would try my best, but didn&#39;t think I could make any promises as to outcome.  Well, we all sat around the computer and for about 6 hours, we researched everything we could find on hacking Pokemon.  The kids mostly watched &quot;tutorial&quot; youtubes and helped me find sites, etc.  At the start, I seriously didn&#39;t even know what hacking was, much less think it was possible.  But, we now have quite a lot of folders with things called &quot;emulations,&quot; &quot;ROMs,&quot; &quot;ISP files, &quot;ISP patches&quot; and others called &quot;Advanced Map&quot; and &quot;Advanced Text.&quot;  We spent last night playing the hacks we could find (lots seem to be in Spanish and I was informed on one youtube tutorial that if we couldn&#39;t figure out the Spanish, then we were too stupid to attempt to make hacks :) ) to get a feel for what other people had done, and tonight the guys are writing their own versions using the map and text things we got, and we have offered to help 2 of their friends get started on this so we all have something to talk about.  By the end of my night last night, my brain felt so fried, I didn&#39;t think I could ever have another thought.  Anyway, I just wanted to say, for anyone who feels overwhelmed by their kids&#39; desire for more and more technical information, if you can be a little bit calm about it, it&#39;s amazing what you can find these days that didn&#39;t even exist, say, last year.  It&#39;s just amazing.  Not too long ago, I would have guaranteed you that there was no way possible I could figure any of this stuff out.  There are so many people willing to share their information via websites, youtubes, etc., that if your kids have an interest that is way out of your comfort zone, you can probably still figure out the basic stuff, and with that, the whole thing just explodes.  With the internet, there is certainly a lot of garbage out there, but there are also people, like people on this list, who are intensely interested in passing along the things that they are passionate about, have learned, the problems that they have encountered and roads not to take, intended to inform and take the scary stuff out of learning something new.  It&#39;s really, truly, amazing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCindy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44225,"nextTopicId":44245}}
