I have to say that the biggest hurdle <br/>\nthat we&#39;ve had isn&#39;t so much the kids we meet and the desire to get <br/>\ntogether, it&#39;s the parents.  Perhaps it&#39;s just where we live, not <br/>\nsure, but it seems like all these neat kids we meet at homeschool <br/>\npark day or the neighborhood, all have parents that greatly restrict <br/>\ntheir kids&#39; time outside of the home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, just going to the mall with a few friends is such <br/>\nan intense negotiation with all the parents of these kids that <br/>\nChamille wants to invite.  They want down to the minute time slots <br/>\n(and if I&#39;m late by 5 min, the child is grounded), one parent may <br/>\ndecide that the mall we&#39;ve picked isn&#39;t ok, or one kid has to be home <br/>\nat 2, even though they have nothing going on, when all the other kids <br/>\ncan be there until 4, and some parents insist that I physically stay <br/>\nat the mall to have check-ins with the kids, cell phones aren&#39;t good <br/>\nenough.  It&#39;s tiring!  I do it, I jump through all those hoops, even <br/>\nwhen they seem absurd to me, just because it means so much to <br/>\nChamille.  However, I&#39;m the only one doing the driving, and putting <br/>\nin the time to do stuff so the kids can hang out and be kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s the same thing going on bike rides in the neighborhood.  All the <br/>\nparents want their teens supervised at all times, so I go, for <br/>\nChamille because they are all unwilling to do it and just expect <br/>\ntheir kids to stay home or ride their bikes in circles in the cul-de-<br/>\nsac.  Yes, teenagers can&#39;t ride their bikes outside of the cul-de-<br/>\nsac.  It&#39;s crazy!  Let&#39;s not even mention the 7-11 2 blks away, or <br/>\nthe swimming pool 3 blks away!  Here I was thinking how cool it would <br/>\nbe to live so close to a beautiful greenway with paths and trails, a <br/>\nswimming pool and a convenience store.  How cool that would be for a <br/>\nkid to go and explore.  Well it is cool and Chamille gets to go and <br/>\ndo that stuff, I just have to tag along.  It&#39;s a good thing she likes <br/>\nme!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don&#39;t remember doing this kind of stuff when I was a kid.  <br/>\nWhen we wanted to get together and go to the mall, one of the parents <br/>\nwould take us and drop us off, or we&#39;d take the bus.  We could <br/>\nusually spend many hours there and then have to be home by dinner <br/>\ntime or whatever.  When I wanted to go get candy from the store, I <br/>\nwould hop on my bike and ride for a mile and be gone for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it just me, or have parents become a lot more restrictive with <br/>\ntheir children&#39;s lives?  It is soooo hard to find times for Chamille <br/>\nto hang out with friends because they are so busy or their parents <br/>\nare just too weird.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep trying to find more homeschool friends, but it takes so much <br/>\ntime!  I just keep plugging away at finding opportunities to meet <br/>\nother teens.  I figure if I stopped trying, nothing would happen, and <br/>\neven if I keep trying and nothing happens, at least we&#39;ve done some <br/>\nfun stuff while trying!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve tried to keep in mind finding others that have <br/>\nsimilar interests by doing those activities.  Right now, Chamille&#39;s <br/>\ninterests ARE meeting other kids, especially ones that like anime or <br/>\nemo screamo music or wearing all black and looking cool.
