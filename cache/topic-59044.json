That isn&#39;t the case anymore.  If you think about what you&#39;ll need to spend on tuition, books (can be well over $400/semester), child-care (if needed), etc.....and the time it will take to graduate during which time you won&#39;t be earning anything, you may very well make out better working part-time at Starbucks or a grocery store!<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you looked at the salaries for entry-level positions in the field you&#39;re interested in?  Many entry-level jobs that require a college degree pay around $27,000-$32,000/year.  Not much more, if at all, than you could make waiting tables at a higher-end restaurant a few nights a week. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from a few years ago, and things have only gotten worse since then:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6668451\">http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6668451</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another thought: add up everything you&#39;d spend going to school for however many years--maybe it would be even more financially advantageous to sink that money into starting a business?<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] parent going back to school?","postDate":"1295649652","msgId":59049,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyRDU1M0I4LTBBMjAtNDIxRi05MDUzLThCREM5NzdGQTI3OUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDI0QjBGMEZDLTYzODUtNDdGQS05Q0IyLTdERjY1QkQ1REZBRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGloY25xcytoMHNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjRCMEYwRkMtNjM4NS00N0ZBLTlDQjItN0RGNjVCRDVERkFGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":59047,"nextInTopic":59050,"prevInTime":59048,"nextInTime":59050,"topicId":59044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It sounds more like you are wanting to return to a career, rather than merely contribute more money to the family coffers. Is the underlying issue that you&#39;re feeling pressure to become *The Breadwinner*, but you feel ambivalent about that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI teach SDU scrapbooking at Michaels after being certified from an online course - that didn&#39;t cost me anything except as many tools as I wanted to purchase. I got my part time job at Michaels after being the Cricut demonstrator (and they paid me to do the training). I got my part time demonstrator job after seeing an ad on a crafting website. The demo hiring company, Advantage Sales and Marketing, offer me other jobs often. That kind of &quot;sales ajacent&quot; job pays well for part time. You could look into that sort of thing. No degree necessarily, just demonstrable skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there are online courses that you can take at night when the kids are sleeping. Not to hide it from them, but to cut into their time less.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked &quot;what&#39;s the difference?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s different because specialized, vocational and interest based instruction, taken voluntarily for individual, personal reasons is different from mandatory schooling with an externally designed, externally tested and assessed curriculum, with behavioral modification thrown in for good measure. <br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing because you want the end results is different than being forced to please some other authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

You might end up learning more and having stories to tell at home that aren&#39;t about what you paid to learn in school, but what you see with your newly deschooled eyes!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you and your children all know that one doesn&#39;t need elementary school to go to high school, and that high school isn&#39;t needed to get into college, and that college isn&#39;t needed to grow up and reproduce, then it shouldn&#39;t hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I want to be here with them every second because I don&#39;t want to miss anything. I feel torn at wanting to lessen my spouses worries when it comes to supporting us financially, but at what cost? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s a harder one.<br/>\nIf you will be needing to pay tuition and transportation and childcare, and if you&#39;ll end up with loans to repay (even if you don&#39;t finish the program), could it be better for you to work retail or food services during hours when your spouse is home?  Sometimes that ends up being the case.  The prestige isn&#39;t there, but sometimes the cash ends up about the same.  Grocery store checkers at union chains do very well. :-)   Your children&#39;s childhoods won&#39;t wait even for the end of the semester.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be great, and it might not, but consider all the side costs (financial, time, attention, peace at home).<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":470422739,"authorName":"Melissa Bendtsen","from":"&quot;Melissa Bendtsen&quot; &lt;melissabendtsen@...&gt;","profile":"melissabendtsen","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"parent going back to school?","postDate":"1295639196","msgId":59044,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGloY25xcytoMHNzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":59045,"prevInTime":59043,"nextInTime":59045,"topicId":59044,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I m looking for a little insight on how I might take a look at our particular situation.
