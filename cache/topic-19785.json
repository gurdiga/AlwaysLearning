Am I missing something?<br/>\n  ~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n  It&#39;s hard for me to blend my unschooling life into where it intersects with <br/>\n  school-minded people.  We have the same kind of thing going on with the 9-10 yo <br/>\n  baseball team my husband coaches.  We give out the &quot;game ball&quot; after most <br/>\n  games.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  After reading what you wrote, I think the point that is being missed by the <br/>\n  coach is that recognition of extra effort is what counts, not the game-winning <br/>\n  point.  I don&#39;t know soccer, so let&#39;s give examples from baseball.  The kid <br/>\n  who very nearly strikes out every time at bat was awarded the game ball for <br/>\n  finally swinging the bat, making contact with the ball (foul), turning his likely <br/>\n  strike-out into a walk, AND getting his glove on the ball when it was hit to <br/>\n  him, and throwing it into second just as he had been taught to do.  Did he win <br/>\n  the game?  No, but he performed beyond his own ability so far, he showed <br/>\n  improvement and had a good attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n  It wasn&#39;t pointed out to him that he always strikes out.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>\n  patronized.  The kid KNOWS he strikes out almost every time.  Our team operates on the <br/>\n  principles of &quot;Fun, Fundamentals, Teamwork, and Winning without violating the <br/>\n  first three.&quot;  Within that framework, Daniel was an excellent example of the <br/>\n  principles we try to foster.  He has a great attitude, which means he&#39;s still <br/>\n  having fun; he&#39;s getting better at hitting, which means he&#39;s working on his <br/>\n  fundamentals; and he threw the ball to second because he knew his teammate would <br/>\n  be expecting it there.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  In most of the games we&#39;ve played, the kid who got the game ball was clearly <br/>\n  outshone in a particular play or at bat by another kid.  Those are usually the <br/>\n  kids who will perform well game after game, i.e., rarely make errors and <br/>\n  usually get on base.  We don&#39;t give game balls to those kids unless their effort <br/>\n  was indeed beyond their usual effort, or indeed win the game for us.  Yes, the <br/>\n  standards are different for each kid, because each kid&#39;s ability is different. <br/>\n  The game ball is for individual effort, which also sometimes advances the <br/>\n  team&#39;s goals, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  Our last two kids who haven&#39;t received a game ball are the two best players.  <br/>\n  One is our son Will.  He&#39;s an unschooled kid.  He knows when he plays well <br/>\n  and does better, and he understands why we give game balls the way we do and he <br/>\n  understands the issue of favoritism of the coach&#39;s son, etc.  More <br/>\n  importantly, since he&#39;s never gone to school and earned gold stars, the outside <br/>\n  reinforcement of the game ball is not as important to him as his own performance.  <br/>\n  Playing the game and making good plays and winning *is* the reward for him in <br/>\n  baseball.  So, he&#39;s willing to wait for everyone else to go first, and he&#39;d be <br/>\n  okay if we left him out entirely.   <br/>\n<br/>\n  The other kid is who we call our Ironman.  His statistics are way beyond <br/>\n  everyone else&#39;s.  He makes clutch plays almost every game and hits the ball in the <br/>\n  outfield and scores runs.  He has a great attitude, too.  We knew going in <br/>\n  that he would be performing above and beyond and there would be plenty of <br/>\n  chances for recognizing his sheer talent.  So we decided to wait until the end and <br/>\n  give him the last game ball to recognize his solid, steady performance through <br/>\n  all 20 games.  We&#39;ve told him in subtle ways that he has not been forgotten.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  The recognition received through the game ball is important to the kids.  We <br/>\n  recognize all the kids after each game, give them a chance to talk about what <br/>\n  they did right.  We emphasize the positive and ignore the negative.  But the <br/>\n  game ball is just a little extra recognition of a &quot;personal best&quot;.  This is <br/>\n  where the schooled mind bumps up against the unschooled one.  We make it as less <br/>\n  school-like as we possibly can.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I think if done well, recognition like awarding the game ball can be a <br/>\n  positive thing.  Passing it around just to take turns isn&#39;t positive, IMO.  We have <br/>\n  to do a bit of turn-taking on our team, but it&#39;s very easy to recognize extra <br/>\n  individual effort if you know what to look for, AND it&#39;s not in the context of <br/>\n  winning first.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Karen<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
