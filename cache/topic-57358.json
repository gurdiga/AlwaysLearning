We live right up the road so I even gave her my<br/>\nphone number so she could call if they had trouble bridling or anything.<br/>\nThey were happy for the offer and when I told my girls they were happy to<br/>\nhelp.  They love sharing their horse knowledge with other kids who are<br/>\ninterested in learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAs we were walking to our cars, the mom said something like, horses are<br/>\ngreat.  They make it really easy to get your kids to eat their peas and do<br/>\ntheir homework.  L  I was totally at a loss for words because even though I<br/>\nknow people are that way, I&#39;ve never heard anyone just come right out and<br/>\nadmit to it.  I wish I had said something enlightening to make her think.<br/>\nUnfortunately, I was sort of shocked and speechless.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nEven without the manipulation factor, horse are just great for kids.  They<br/>\nlearn to be responsible for creature that depends on them and they learn to<br/>\nwork through things that are difficult.  The list of the benefits that kids<br/>\nget from working with horses is endless.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57343,"nextTopicId":57319}}
