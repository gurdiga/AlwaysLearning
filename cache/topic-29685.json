Any patterns there? Morgan will take a while to get comfortable <br/>\nwith a friend, especially if the friend is very social/ in a very <br/>\nchatty mood. So I often have to run interferrence for the first <br/>\nfifteen minutes or so. If I don&#39;t she&#39;s cranky and unsettled and <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t get along with her friend until we or they leave, so that <br/>\nfirst fifteen minutes is pretty important to *her* - no matter how <br/>\nmuch I may be jonesing for some &quot;mommy time&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH one of Mo&#39;s friends is really easygoing unless she&#39;s hungry or <br/>\ntired, so *her* mom has to check in with her more later on during a <br/>\nplaydate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He will push him, throw something at him, try to make him fall.

Taking my son aside and telling him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that&#39;s<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; not a good way to keep friends or You hurt him!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I find it more helpful to think in terms of helping kids communicate <br/>\nwith each other, rather than policing their interactions. As Sandra <br/>\npointed out, you may have to be right there with them for awhile to <br/>\nhelp them figure out how to communicate with each other *before* <br/>\nthings get to the pushing/hitting/throwing stage. It may also be <br/>\nhelpful to talk with your ds before the playdate and decide then <br/>\nwhich toys he&#39;s comfortable sharing *this time* - with many <br/>\nreassurances, if necessary, that the other child isn&#39;t going to be <br/>\ntaking those toys home. That&#39;s something Mo worries about, when <br/>\nfriends come over - especially with her favorite cat. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do encourage Mo and her playmates to say &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t like <br/>\nthat&quot; as clearly as possible. When the kids can remember to do that, <br/>\nit gives me a little more freedom to be farther away, in another <br/>\nroom, or whatever. That can take some time and practice, though - <br/>\nand occasional backup on my part &quot;I heard a stop!&quot; or &quot;stop means <br/>\nstop&quot;. Sound kind of silly, when I write it down, but when Mo or one <br/>\nof her pals really gets wound up, they don&#39;t always notice the other <br/>\nchild&#39;s reaction. So that&#39;s something to look at wrt your ds - is he <br/>\nso wrapped up in his own feelings that he&#39;s just not aware of how <br/>\nhe&#39;s effecting the other child? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility is that he&#39;s noticing, but lacks impulse <br/>\ncontrol. Then its even more important for you to be present and help <br/>\nmediate things *before* he gets to that point. Not the respite you <br/>\nmay have been looking for!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I ask my son why he treats his friend that way, i say we don&#39;t <br/>\n </span></blockquote>treat<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; him like that and if he wants to keep his friend he can&#39;t do that. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think its better to assume your ds is doing the best he can with <br/>\nthe skills and resources he has *right now*. Skills take some time <br/>\nand modelling and practice. Resources include enough food, rest, <br/>\nsense of security, and Mom (there are others, like maturity, but <br/>\nthose are the resources you can affect). Can the other mom help out? <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 5.5, Ray 13)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] son&#39;s behavior with friend","postDate":"1183221218","msgId":29686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU1OUY2RUQxLTM0RjMtNDJBMS04NUZELUY5ODRCNDk2M0FERUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcxMjZCQzY0LUIxRTItNDY1My05MjM5LTEzRDEzMURCRjRBMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDcxMjZCQzY0LUIxRTItNDY1My05MjM5LTEzRDEzMURCRjRBMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":29685,"nextInTopic":29689,"prevInTime":29685,"nextInTime":29687,"topicId":29685,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-You suggested getting him a friend.
