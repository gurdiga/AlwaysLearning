But people who fight against the system because they don&#39;t like it rather than working with what is are more likely to get caught in the crosshairs. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s noble for people to fight the system to get something better for themselves. It&#39;s *not* noble if your kids feel a lack in their lives because of the situation between you and your wife. Don&#39;t even *think* about her part in it. You have power over your part. If they feel this fight you&#39;re having against the courts or your wife is having an effect on how well you&#39;re a father to them, then from their point of view you&#39;re prioritizing your ideals over their needs. It will make zero difference if you&#39;re fighting for what you believe is a better life for them if *they feel* you&#39;re not making the most of the life you have with them right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to fight the system, make it separate and secondary to working with what you have right now to build a life with your children. Your children don&#39;t care about social injustice. They don&#39;t care about unschooling. They don&#39;t care if you&#39;re fighting for some ideal life you have in mind for them. As long as their very basic food and shelter needs are met, they first and foremost care about whether their parents love them for who they are. How well you&#39;re doing at that is not based on *your* perception but on *their* perception. If your fight with the State or their mom feels *to them* like your agenda for unschooling is more important than their immediate peace, security and family integrity, they&#39;ll feel you&#39;re putting your ideals ahead of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you perceive yourself as fighting the noble fight. But your kids won&#39;t ever see it that way while they&#39;re still emotionally dependent on their mother and father. Right now while they&#39;re young it&#39;s their perception of what you care about that&#39;s most important in how well you&#39;re doing as a father.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now your priority is being a father to them. But you&#39;re writing to us about other priorities. People here can help you work with what you have to be a better father, that will, in turn, help you get more to work with. But fighting the system is not only out of the scope of this list but would be counter to the goal which is helping parents be better parents to their kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need advice and support","postDate":"1366193591","msgId":71238,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERBQUU3OTI1LTc1QkItNEEzNC04QjY2LTYzQjQ4OERGNTk1N0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtra3UybCtlbTNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtra3UybCtlbTNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71236,"nextInTopic":71239,"prevInTime":71237,"nextInTime":71239,"topicId":71214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Perhaps she kept shoving her needs down because she felt guilty for asking you to give more. Perhaps you were too distracted and overwhelmed by your disabled child. It&#39;s understandable. You were doing something noble supporting your child, it would have been reasonable for you to expect her to emotionally support you and give you a break when she came home.

In fact I discontinued posting here a few years back because not many of you supported my decision to allow my child back into public school. I consider the free choice of being in school to be just as much part of the Unschooling philosophy as the free choice not to attend public school. My daughter thrived in school absolutely because she wasn&#39;t forced to go. She knew she could come home any time she desired. She enjoyed the resources that the school provided that I simply couldn&#39;t provide at home. And of course I continued her unschooling while she was at home with the resources I could provide.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I wanted to clarify, that I have zero contact with my children because of false allegations of abuse that my wife began claiming as a divorce and custody strategy. She has been provided 4 restraining orders against me while all of our life long family and friends have been standing beside me begging to be heard by the court to give testimony that I am the last man on earth that would be abusive to anyone, much less the wife and children I cherish the most on this earth.

It requires a certain amount of trust between the two families, so that&#39;s where I recommend you begin - what can you do so that your children&#39;s mother sees you as trustworthy where their education is concerned? That&#39;s more often a question women are faced with than men, so it could be helpful for you to seek out past threads where moms are asking how they can get more support from husbands who are reluctant, skeptical, or otherwise unsupportive of unschooling (I&#39;m trying to think of &quot;search&quot; words - unsupportive comes up with this thread:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/69265\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/69265</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that helped us continue unschooling, and eventually allowed my stepson&#39;s mom to be more directly involved, was that I did more reporting than what was required by the state as a way of keeping her and her family reassured that her son wasn&#39;t suffering educational neglect. It may be that you can discuss the option of homeschooling with a mutually agreed-upon curriculum as an intermediate option.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, if the kids are going back and forth from one house to the other, school can be a source of stability and reassurance... especially if there are big differences in expectations between homes. It can also be something for divorced parents to rally together around: helping your kids get their needs met in the context of school. And it could be that after a couple years of building trust and mutual support in that context you could try home or unschooling. Part of what made unschooling Ray possible is that he was in school for a few years while various family arrangements settled down. It wasn&#39;t exactly a good experience, but it did set the stage for more trust between the two families, and That was a good thing. In the long run, it made for better relationships between Ray and both his biological parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nSupporting your kids&#39; relationship with their mother (other beloved parent) is vital to unschooling. It&#39;s vital to them as people. Given a choice, it&#39;s better to support the relationship than to try and insist upon unschooling - because if you&#39;re undermining their relationship with their mom, you&#39;re not unschooling anyway; you have a mean, sneaky, secret emotional curriculum you&#39;re trying to implement. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I am seeking support of any kind from anyone who is interested in helping a fellow unschooler defend our legal, and healthy, beliefs from intrusion by the government, and who would help defend against the interference of &quot;The State&quot; in our legal private lives.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nStop kidding yourself - it&#39;s not about legalities, it&#39;s personal: a grudge match for the hearts of your children. Don&#39;t do it! Don&#39;t go there! Don&#39;t add one jot to their suffering. Look for ways to conciliate, to be sweet and gentle with their wounded hearts. Keep them and their hearts in the forefront of your thoughts and don&#39;t try to hurt someone they love. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need advice and support","postDate":"1366140160","msgId":71217,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPVWdXODEwOVVCOWZiZU9YaVROdWVOdEVKbzdoZWJWbUVIZ2VIaWRlMGFaQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRDNjU2QjJBLTRDOEMtNEU5Ri1BQTdDLTczODU2MEYwMTU5QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGtrazJ2aytudjA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8NEM2NTZCMkEtNEM4Qy00RTlGLUFBN0MtNzM4NTYwRjAxNTlCQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":71216,"nextInTopic":71221,"prevInTime":71216,"nextInTime":71218,"topicId":71214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Don t fight The State at the expense of your child s current peace - especially for a child who has already had some major traumatic life events - divorcing","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-504455554\">Don&#39;t fight &quot;The State&quot; at the expense of your child&#39;s current peace -<br/>\nespecially for a child who has already had some major traumatic life events<br/>\n- divorcing parents and being put into school.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need advice and support","postDate":"1366139783","msgId":71216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDNjU2QjJBLTRDOEMtNEU5Ri1BQTdDLTczODU2MEYwMTU5QkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGtrazJ2aytudjA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGtrazJ2aytudjA3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":71215,"nextInTopic":71217,"prevInTime":71215,"nextInTime":71217,"topicId":71214,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

And if they disagree so much on something that&#39;s largely poltiical, that&#39;s putting other things before their children.  Your children might have been happier if you and your wife could have been at peace an they had been in school.  From that point, if school wasn&#39;t working for them, maybe both of you culd have seen and agreed that bringing them home might be better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if one parent&#39;s move on this chessboard is that unschooling is more important than the marriage, everyone is likely to lose.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=I am seeking support of any kind from anyone who is interested in helping a fellow unschooler defend our legal, and healthy, beliefs from intrusion by the government, and who would help defend against the interference of &quot;The State&quot; in our legal private lives.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDefend OUR?   You want people to help you defend your choices and hopes from the mother of your children, and that&#39;s not the same as intrusion from the government.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you married and had children, that family unit had some power and rights, but one parent doesn&#39;t have &quot;a legal private life&quot; that excludes the other parent�not even after a divorce, unless one is given full custody and the other is given a restraining order.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you were born, you were born somewhere.  There were laws, before you were born.  Your parents probably knew that.  It&#39;s not governmental intrusion in &quot;legal private lives&quot; (I&#39;ve never heard that phrase before; it&#39;s interesting) to provide schools and write laws so that some parents can&#39;t choose to keep their children home as sharecroppers or factory workers or world-of-warcraft gold farmers.  The first two were more likely 90 years ago than now.  The third is more likely in China.  <br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I am seeking support of any kind from anyone who is interested in helping a fellow unschooler defend our legal, and healthy, beliefs...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think trying to keep children at home against their mother&#39;s will is more legal or healthy than to put them in school against their mother&#39;s will.  I think you&#39;re asking the government to intrude and keep your wife from putting the kids in school, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning will work best when children are fed, warm, feel safe and loved.
