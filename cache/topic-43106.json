So, if","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1716259447\">You are right. Apparently the average age in the U.S. is 12.6 years old, and in Iceland it&#39;s 13.06 years old. That puts the five year mark at about 17. So, if they are waiting for their ovulation to stabilize, women should be getting pregnant at 18. They aren&#39;t though. The average age for first birth in the U.S. is 25.2 years in 2005. In 1971 the average age was 21. In 1973 the age at first menstruation (menarche) was .34 years later than in 2005, so almost 13 years old. And even though J. Richard Urdy found in 1979 that earlier age at menarche predicted earlier age at first pregnancy, if not first birth, earlier national averages of age at first menarche isn&#39;t lowering national averages for age at first birth. That argues that reproductive readiness is not the true predictor of age at first pregnancy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSexual precociousness is usually found in non-human animals when the environment is risky. There is a beautiful study of Virginia Opossums by Steve Austad who compared the mortality risks of Opossums living on an island without cars and those on the mainland. The car-free Opossums not only had longer lifespans they also were less sexually precocious. They had a later age at first reproduction, at which point they were larger and had larger litter sizes. My memory is that the same biologist did a quick study of fish response to increased risk of predation. He whizzed up their predator fish and would put some of the au jus into the tank where they were living and the fish he was examining began to put energy into reproduction. David says that a guy named Stibor published similar findings (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7855638848kt73h/)\">http://www.springerlink.com/content/k7855638848kt73h/)</a> but that the story about Austad doing it, he had an office down the hall from one of David and my professor&#39;s, is<br/>\n probably also true. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means is that environmental factors play a huge role in when someone reproduces. Putting energy into growth is really important. With girls we stop putting energy into growth once we start putting it into reproduction. Delaying age at menarche is a good thing with that in mind. Bruce Ellis has done research using a giant New Zealand database on factors predicting early age at menarche. One study he is second author on looks at father absence (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/d9xk7y)\">http://tinyurl.com/d9xk7y)</a> as a predictive factor in age at menarche. They found that younger sisters in households with a father who became an absentee father during their childhood had an earlier age at menarche by 11 months than their older sister. The same was not found in households with father presence. In another paper (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cals.arizona.edu/fcs/fshd/people/ellis/publications/Ellis&Essex2007.pdf)\">http://cals.arizona.edu/fcs/fshd/people/ellis/publications/Ellis&Essex2007.pdf)</a> he reports finding &quot;Older age at menarche in mothers, higher socioeconomic status, greater mother-based<br/>\n Parental Supportiveness, and lower third-grade body mass index each uniquely and significantly predicted later sexual development in daughters. Consistent with a life history perspective, quality of parental investment emerged as a centralfeature of the proximal family environment in relation to pubertal timing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJim Chisholm has written a book where he talks about asking women how long they think they&#39;ll live and compares it with their Sociosexuality Orientation Inventory (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/bh4459)\">http://tinyurl.com/bh4459)</a>, a measure used to assess long term mating versus short term mating preferences. Women who believe they will live a shorter life are more likely to fall into short term mating preferences. Jim Chisholm also as a paper (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/bh4459)\">http://tinyurl.com/bh4459)</a> where he found &quot;Women reporting more troubled family relations early in life had<br/>\nearlier menarche, earlier first birth, were more likely to identify<br/>\nwith insecure adult attachment styles, and expected shorter lifespans.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, all that is to say that age at first reproduction is not simply a biological readiness issue. It is clearly a gene x environment interaction affect, as is so much else. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Joanna Murphy &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ridingmom@...\">ridingmom@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Thursday, 12 March, 2009 5:17:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Challenging article<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Teenage girls suffer, if that&#39;s the right word, from low fecundity.

It takes about 5 years after starting menstruating for women to reach stable fertile menstrual cycles. It&#39;s called a period of sub-fecundity. Also, early foetal loss is lowest after age 20 and before age 35. Among most populations the period of peak fertility for women is in their late 20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s. Ache hunter gatherer women, for example, are most likely to give birth from age 30 to 35.

It relates to something I&#39;ve been thinking about for the past year - probably b/c I&#39;m finding myself wishing I hadn&#39;t needed my young adult life to figure out who I was and what I wanted out of life and would/could have started my own family sooner.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still in the deschooling phase of Unschooling, and it is bringing up lots of stuff like this for me - how things could be different if we (society in general) threw out conventional parenting and school.  Children could spend their youth being children and would be allowed to mature through that process, not finally start the maturing process (mental and emotional) in their young adult years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think a big reason so many of us have/are waiting so long to get married and start our own family is because we need our young adult lives to find ourselves once we are out of parents&#39; homes and have the freedom to finally &quot;be&quot; and think for ourselves and essentially finally mature.  At least this is the case for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also been contemplating this delayed child-rearing issue.
