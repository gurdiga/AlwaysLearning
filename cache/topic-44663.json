If I&#39;m understanding you right.<br/>\nHere is one article I was reading yesterday:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/seeingit\">http://sandradodd.com/seeingit</a> <br/>\nI was wondering, &quot;Am I providing, doing, all that is mine to do with my children on this unschooling journey?&quot; <br/>\nWhen we first began unschooling I did not do anything. I was not sure how it was supposed to look. I really needed to step back and put every thing down. All the books all the worksheets...every thing. Then I watched my children. I watched my daughter step out into her interests. I kept/keep reading and looking for direction because that is me. I then had a better idea of what is mine to do. Help my children find what they are looking for. What is it she wants to learn? Then we search and find. We go to craft stores, we look at garage sales and we find those interesting things she is seeking. As an example, she wanted to make her own collection of dolls. She has created 100 different craft dolls. In my school head I&#39;m thinking what does this have to do with learning. I turn it around and see, we are learning about different people, villages, and times. She made a village out of old cardboard boxes and created street names and local places to visit. Is<br/>\n she reading yet at 7, no. Is she creating stories, yes. Is she learning? Yes, all the time!<br/>\nSo looking to the whole wide world for learning is an adventure of my own too. I also think I &#39;have to&#39; listen to my children and help them follow their bliss. It won&#39;t work if I don&#39;t listen, I don&#39;t show up, I don&#39;t offer guidance. Like the idea of visiting a historical village or looking up special books. As I move from that school in my head I am able to enjoy all we do together so much more.<br/>\nIf I don&#39;t do these things we will miss an opportunity and there will be resentment on all ends. However finding the balance between every thing and nothing is the key for a joyful experience for all. It is all a choice and when if it feels like a burden then it is time to switch gears.<br/>\nYou wrote:<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m an unschooler. Lessons are never over. On the other hand, lessons never really begin. Children&#39;s questions are answered and an atmosphere of learning is created so that questions are constant and answers are never far away. &quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/allkinds\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/allkinds</a><br/>\nThank you for sharing your thought.
