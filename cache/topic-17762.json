It&#39;s been very hard <br/>\ngetting ready because the girls don&#39;t know we&#39;re going.  Two years ago <br/>\nwhen we went we surprised the girls with the trip and they asked us to <br/>\nalways do trips that way because it was so exciting.  So that&#39;s what <br/>\nwe&#39;ve done, but it&#39;s been really hard since they want to be right by my <br/>\nside all the time...<br/>\n<br/>\nbut right now, they have the Twister game mat out and they&#39;re pretending <br/>\nthey&#39;re at the beach!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAND, Soleille, our 3 yr old, just came down with a fever today.  She&#39;s <br/>\nsleeping right now so I hope she feels better when she wakes up.  She <br/>\nhas no other flu symptoms so I&#39;m hopeful.  But have you ever had the <br/>\nfeeling that you&#39;ve made something happen just by thinking about it?  I <br/>\nwas so worried about traveling during flu season...  Just coincidence, I <br/>\nknow, but still...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe girls did great on the trip from NY to S. Carolina for the <br/>\nconference but I&#39;m worried about Leiren now.  She&#39;s 13 months and <br/>\nwalking/climbing on everything.  It&#39;s going to be challenging keeping <br/>\nher entertained.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHope you all had a happy new year&#39;s eve and I wish you all the best. <br/>\n I&#39;ll be back in a few weeks.  I&#39;ll let you know how we managed not <br/>\nhaving forced feeding at mealtime or a bed-time at my in-laws very small <br/>\nhouse there.  My mil says she understands unschooling, but we&#39;ll <br/>\nsee...and hope!<br/>\n<br/>\nWish us luck!<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17761,"nextTopicId":17769}}
