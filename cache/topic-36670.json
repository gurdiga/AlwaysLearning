I&#39;m grateful.  So anyway, I can relate with what <br/>\nSandra wrote - sometimes it&#39;s gets yucky being the so-called bad guy all the <br/>\ntime.  Especially when as a Radical Unschooler, I am striving for peace, <br/>\nkindness, and an overall joy / zest for life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;It may make you feel like a bad guy but I don&#39;t think it makes you seem <br/>\nlike a bad guy.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI differ with this thought because I experienced otherwise.  Even if 99% <br/>\n(insert clause of pretend statistic here) of a list, tribe, group, etc. want <br/>\nsomething run a certain way, that still leaves the hypothetical 1% who your <br/>\npossibly gonna get a nasty email from.  It&#39;s tiring on the soul to be called <br/>\nthe ultimate bad guy and the crappiest Radical Unschooler on the earth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Crystal~<br/>\n<br/>\n*Who knows she not a bad guy but sometimes wanted to be one and send <br/>\nsomething really nasty back.  I think the best nasty email I got was one <br/>\nthat said, &quot;YOUR A BUNCH OF FREAKS AND DESERVE EACH OTHER!&quot;  &lt;bg&gt;  I love my <br/>\nfreaky tribe!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36642,"nextTopicId":36606}}
