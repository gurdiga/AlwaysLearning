The researchers attributed that to some degree to being about their eating less &quot;junk food&quot; and more &quot;healthy food&quot; when they were home with their mother monitoring what they ate. My assumption is that children are healthier with a parent home because they are less stressed. Stress is a wonderful way of getting and staying sick. My guess is that children who eat less candy may be in a similar boat. What they may have found is an intermediary variable and not a causal variable. That is candy eating could be a measure of parental presence, or some other factor, and as such not the factor of interest. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing both of these studies are getting government funding under obesity guidelines. The government puts out a research remit and says we&#39;ll fund studies that fall within that remit. It means that in order to look at the effects of having a mother in the home they had to tack on an examination of food availability for children. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Mel &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beensclan@...\">beensclan@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 4 October, 2009 11:40:49 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] This was on the Newfoundland evening news....<br/>\n<br/>\nHi All,<br/>\nAccording to the latest research, children who consume candy every day are far more likely to become criminals later in life.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=107762&sectionid=3510210\">http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=107762&sectionid=3510210</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m smiling as I type this as I think this is just good old fashioned fear mongering.

The only circumstance under which it is appropriate to say that sweets cause violence is if the chemical content of the sweets is correlated with violence regardless of whether the people concerned know they are getting it.

I rather doubt it because the relevant factors include all of the ideas the child came across when he was growing up, whether anyone took the time to explain good moral ideas, whether the child felt he could trust his parents or thought they were manipulative bastards and so on. Now it might be the case that children who learned good moral ideas did not eat as many sweets and so that the causation is precisely the reverse of what Moore alleges: good ideas lead to less sweet consumption rather than the other way around. It might also be the case that this correlation holds only in families where sweet consumption viewed as a bad thing that should be discouraged, i.e. - almost all families, and so the children who learned good habits also picked up the idea that sweet consumption is bad through a quirk of our culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the studies I have read indicating that something that children like leads them to become evil granny murderers have the flaw that they are written by people who do not seem to pay any attention to the question of how to explain their results and it is possible in every case to drive a coach and horses through the holes in their argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":255816758,"authorName":"Mel","from":"&quot;Mel&quot; &lt;beensclan@...&gt;","profile":"beensclan","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: This was on the Newfoundland evening news....","postDate":"1254708195","msgId":47764,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhhYms1MytvcjZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU0NzRERjYxMDYxNDQxMzc5NEY0REE3MTkwQ0E3NkU2QFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":47763,"nextInTopic":47767,"prevInTime":47763,"nextInTime":47765,"topicId":47759,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
