The first<br/>\nthree days, Wednesday through Friday, are spent advertising and making final<br/>\npreparations. You show the house on Saturday and Sunday while the kids are<br/>\naway with your spouse or a friend or relative. Interested parties leave<br/>\ntheir Names, phone numbers and what they are willing to pay.

They<br/>\ncan come by and look at the house over months or over the weekend. 2, The<br/>\nhouse is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.

All our walls are now painted with semi-gloss or eggshell paint and I wipe finger prints off more regularly.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery morning go through a routine to pull the house together.  Wipe out sinks, flush toilets, pick clothes and towels up off the floor, make beds and vacuum areas that seem to need it.  Get some decorative large baskets and put one in each room that the kids use the most.  When you get a call from the realtor, go around and put toys and stuff in the baskets and leave the house.  Try to stay on top of dishes and wipe up as you go.  Hopefully the house will sell quickly.
