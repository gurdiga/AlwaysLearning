I was terrified to read in class. The first book I read was what to expect when you expecting. I spent every night during my pregnancy reading that book. It was painful slow going. I think I thought I couldn&#39;t read because of all the anxiety I felt. I did not read to my older children. I was to self consous. My Mom and Mother in law read to them. Once I got the hang of it I read lots of books. I love reading now. We began homeschooling when my 3rd child was kindergarten age. I got a hooked on phonics set. I could not understand it at all. My son complained that it was way to boaring. He took the little books a read them all without instruction. I was amazed. My youngest son has had no instruction and he has learned to read. Thankfully none of my kids has the fear I was bogged down with for so long. My daughter has brain damage and she has a<br/>\n hard time with lots of things but even she does not seem bothered by not knowing something. She shouts out &quot;how do you spell this or that&quot;, and someone will just tell her. It does my spirit good to see her not being shamed for something she can&#39;t do yet.<br/>\nTiffani<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from Yahoo!

Nobody could have taught me to play ukulele not simply because learning is an internal thing, but because I struggle to follow someone else&#39;s agenda. If I had gone in the first couple of months of my ukulele experience to a teacher to be shown how to learn I would have quit, almost undoubtedly, playing ukulele. I would have grown bored of the whole linear nature of the teaching and would have just fallen off. My relationship with the ukulele has jumped all over the place. It&#39;s been driven by different focuses. But it has been mine. If I let someone else tell me what I needed to learn in order to master the ukulele, if I had taken someone else&#39;s path to learning how to play, I would have walked away from the ukulele like I did with all the instruments I tried as a child. And that&#39;s probably a personal failing. I guess that&#39;s my conflict of interest in this discussion. But<br/>\n that perspective isn&#39;t mine alone: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://brennamcbroom.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/why-i-dropped-out-of-college/\">http://brennamcbroom.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/why-i-dropped-out-of-college/</a> is Brenna McBroom&#39;s discussion about why she dropped out of college. There is something fundamentally right with defining your own relationship with learning. I think looking to other people for knowledge is absolutely part of learning. I think the problem arises when you let them decide things like phonics is the core understanding needed for learning to read or you must play classical music for 4 years before you can begin playing rock guitar.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":547876783,"authorName":"Mrs Jones","from":"Mrs Jones &lt;m.jones545@...&gt;","profile":"m.jones545@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Answering other questions","postDate":"1357261522","msgId":70108,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTcyNjE1MjIuNjc5MDYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE3MTgwMy5tYWlsLmlyMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPaEdGWkQ4dkFQeitOUk9VMHpHWEJrOWJzbXJxSkZRME16dlkxZlRZb1dwd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":70107,"nextInTopic":70109,"prevInTime":70107,"nextInTime":70109,"topicId":70084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***You can explain that mechanism a thousand times to a kid who isn t ready to be able to make that sound/letter association and it will do nothing but ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-239774028\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; For example, when you explain the mecanism of phonics, when you sound out<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; words together you are &quot;teaching reading&quot;.

You can surround a child with printed materials, read to<br/>\nthem, show them how phonics work by sounding out some words as you&#39;re<br/>\nreading along in a book, point out words as you&#39;re reading that don&#39;t follow<br/>\nthe standard rules of phonics and therefore sound differently than one might<br/>\nthink when seeing them in writing, give them picture flashcards with printed<br/>\nwords on the flip-side of each one, play rhyming games, label everything in<br/>\nyour house. but they will not read until they - personally themselves - are<br/>\nready, and they make the magic their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nTeaching reading interferes with the process and tries to get ahead of the<br/>\nmagic - it tries to break it down into little steps and it tries to<br/>\nprescribe things like &quot;you should read little words like cat before you can<br/>\nread big words like catastrophe&quot; and &quot;easy readers are for kids and the Wall<br/>\nStreet Journal isn&#39;t something your barely-reading-self is ready for yet&quot;<br/>\nand such.  Teaching often makes something of a mess where there could have<br/>\nbeen a beautiful experience.  It puts the Learner in a passive role, rather<br/>\nthan an active one.

Teaching is a weird term. It implies that by getting the presentation just so someone else can&#39;t help but derive the knowledge that you are imparting. It implies that the burden of learning is on the teacher and not the learner. Even if I gone to someone seeking ukulele instruction, if I had put myself forward as a ukulele novice to some ukulele master they could only impart the knowledge that I was prepared to learn. No matter how well they taught, how skilful their ability to make something understandable, my learning is entirely dependent on my ability to engage with the material. They wouldn&#39;t have taught me anything. They would have facilitated my learning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;For example, when you explain the mecanism of phonics, when you sound out words together you are &quot;teaching reading&quot;.

It&#39;s having a conversation. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/teaching/\">http://sandradodd.com/teaching/</a> explains better than I can. But to teach is a verb without a clear action. Presumably teaching is only teaching in the presence of someone actually learning what you are teaching. So, if you talked about phonics to someone who didn&#39;t give a toss, or couldn&#39;t really understand what you were explaining, than are you teaching or are you just talking to yourself, mostly? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you read? Again, I seem to be a sight reader. I only very occasional reach for phonetic pronunciations of words, if ever. And that&#39;s probably a secondary grab. I read by sight first. So if someone stressed phonics to me, I would be unlikely to grasp their meaning. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;But you are lying to your child. Or so I argue. You are telling them that you hold the key to doing their learning project.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote> <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;I desagree. Why would I tell them (overtly or implied) I am &quot;holding the key&quot;? Why would they need to get that impression? If the instruction is wanted and is offered in a respectful and useful way like any other help , it is just that; a welcomed help.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If a child came to you and said &quot;teach me to read&quot; and you said okay you are implying that you are capable of teaching them to read. I don&#39;t believe you are. I believe that by suggesting that you can teach somebody how to read or how to play ukulele or how to bake bread you are owning their learning in a way that is a lie. You can say I can help. You can say I can show you what I do. But I don&#39;t think you can teach someone how to read. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra mentioned ballet and karate as things that need clear instruction. So, let&#39;s assume that is true. Let us imagine a ballet instructor teaching a class how to do the 5 basic ballet positions. They aren&#39;t really teaching it. They are demonstrating it. An instructor will probably even go around the classroom and put people into the right position if they are out of line. They will work to get the kinetic memory in place. But they will only be able to go as far as that person is interested in going. Or capable of going. Teaching only exists in the presence of learning. And sometimes learning isn&#39;t possible. The 5 basic ballet positions aren&#39;t possible if you can&#39;t walk. You can, possibly, do an adapted version. But if you are trying to teach a pre-walker how to do the third position, well, they aren&#39;t going to learn it. No matter how good a teacher you believe you are. No matter how well you know the third position and can express the third position to<br/>\n other people. <br/>\n<br/>\nTeach is an awkward idea. Formal instruction is different from teach. But, again, it only works when someone is interested in learning what is being instructed. And even then the instruction may not go out, may not be applied precisely as intended. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Answering other questions","postDate":"1357260522","msgId":70100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPaEdGWkQ4dkFQeitOUk9VMHpHWEJrOWJzbXJxSkZRME16dlkxZlRZb1dwd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNTcyNTg4NzEuODQ1NzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE3MTgwNi5tYWlsLmlyMi55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":70099,"nextInTopic":70101,"prevInTime":70099,"nextInTime":70101,"topicId":70084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I&#39;m a lifelong horse person, so I often relate what I know from studying them all my life. My most favorite horse gurus (some still alive, some dead) do the same thing. They almost never answer a question directly. They have an uncanny ability to look past what the person thinks they need to know, and what is really at the heart of the matter. Most people are only looking at the surface. They see the symptom as the thing to solve. But that&#39;s not what the good instructor will want to address - they want to go much deeper. I&#39;ve seen a lot of students quit the guru and find someone else that says what they want to hear. Or give them a cookie-cutter system to follow. Of course this only brings temporary relief, so they&#39;re back to square one in no time. But, hey, they didn&#39;t have to challenge themselves to really change.

Or so I argue. You are telling them that you hold the key to doing their learning project. I&#39;m referencing Between the Folds again, because there were so many lovely moment of insight in that documentary about origami. Eric Joisel, a French origami artist whose work is amazing, said that when someone asks him to teach them how to make his origami they are asking him to give them 30 years of his life. 30 years it took him of exploring art and paper and ideas and living and moving through the world to be able to make figures like <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sweet-station.com/blog/2008/12/eric-joisel/.\">http://sweet-station.com/blog/2008/12/eric-joisel/.</a> Learning is not something that can be handed to you. It is something you do. It is incremental even if it looks like it is occurring in leaps and bounds. Learning to read is a process that varies by individual. But it is always a process that occurs within the individual in response to their environment. So, I suppose, if Simon or Linnaea had<br/>\n asked me to teach them to read I would have offered to read to them. I would have bought them more comics and more graphic novels and more pokemon cards and more video games and more of the things that they were already interested in, all of which had the written word as part of the experience. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Not everything has to be learnt by osmosis/autodidact. Imo, formal instruction has it&#39;s place in unschooling too, as long as it is wanted. I sometimes get the feeling that you think learning &quot;on your own&quot; is somehow superior to receiving instruction. Is this so? Or is it mainly with regards to reading you feel this way?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Formal instruction has it&#39;s place where the thing can be instructed. So, using Eric Joisel&#39;s statement about 30 years being asked for when someone asked him to teach them his origami, my guess is that he could certainly show them the basics. That he could give them a step into origami. He could talk about the specifics. But was derived from the discussion and where that discussion took the listener would have only a very tangential amount to do with Eric Joisel. <br/>\n<br/>\nI play ukulele. I bake bread. Both things are skills and in both of those arenas I could have sought out formal instruction. I didn&#39;t learn to play ukulele by osmosis. I didn&#39;t learn to bake bread by osmosis. I played ukulele. I baked bread. When I failed, as I did regularly, I would seek out information about how to not fail in the same way the next time. So I have books on baking bread and on playing ukulele. I have watched videos on baking bread and on playing ukulele. I have sought information that has incrementally improved my understanding and my skill. I&#39;m not terribly good at ukulele. I&#39;m fairly good at baking bread. But I&#39;ve been baking bread a lot longer than I&#39;ve been playing ukulele. Nobody taught me how to play ukulele or how to bake bread. I derived those skills by filling my environment with ukulele players and bread bakers via the amazing tool that is the internet. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":524826440,"authorName":"Kelly Halldorson","from":"Kelly Halldorson &lt;unschoolbus42@...&gt;","profile":"kellyhalldorson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Answering other questions","postDate":"1357252944","msgId":70093,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERFOTMyQjNGLUVGQ0UtNDU3My1CRkI4LTVBNDZDOENFMjVFQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPKzg1LStxLURmK0xXREI0SEJyUTJKOW43N18zZ2pqV0I9Y3RTSnN0S0RHd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVGRDc0REYxLTFEQUMtNDEwOS1BNjI1LTZDMEY0N0M5MzNGN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhOOFNqTnd4X1NhbmtGcVE5WXZkdDk4RlZldlA9UDRpZ25xREszSzVQMjhMZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDBGRkI4RUFBLTlERjEtNDI5MS04M0UwLUZDMEVFM0M1OTIwQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQU9PVGFYTys4NS0rcS1EZitMV0RCNEhCclEySjluNzdfM2dqaldCPWN0U0pzdEtER3dAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70092,"nextInTopic":70094,"prevInTime":70092,"nextInTime":70094,"topicId":70084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Or am I misunderstanding?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if a child wanted to learn how to hoop (fancy hula hooping)? Would we be talking about finding ways to distract the child from not knowing how to hoop yet, or pursuing interests despite not knowing how to hoop, protecting him from people who might embarrass him for not knowing how to hoop or hooping for him?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHooping is a thing. Hooping is an end in itself. Reading is a tool. It&#39;s a means to an end. Reading is about deriving information from the environment. It isn&#39;t the same as wanting to go to a cosplay event or the same as loving kookaburras. It is more like wanting to drive. And while there are ways in which driving is an end, race car driving for example or derby car, and while there are ways to meet some of a desire to drive before you are of legal driving age, like going to bumper cars or building a box car, mostly driving is a means to an end. And end that can be met in lots of different ways. You can have a driver. You can take the bus. You can walk. You can bike. Reading is more like that. You can have a reader. You can explore the world with other cues. Meredith mentioned in an a post about how she had to learn to read comics and graphic novels. She had to learn to derive information from the panels without words. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe hooping is like reading if hooping is being used as a means to an end. I watched Between the Folds the other evening and Dr. Erik Demaine said that he really folding paper. He started folding paper because he really like the math and the paper folding was a means to accessing that math. But in folding paper he discovered that he really liked folding paper. So maybe hooping is a means to accessing the people at the beach or the park who you really like. So it isn&#39;t the hooping that is really the goal. It&#39;s the other people. Or maybe you are interested in orbits. Or maybe there is something else and it isn&#39;t the hooping that is really what you want. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe hooping is like reading in that if you aren&#39;t a minimum size or a minimum coordination hooping is unlikely to happen. Maybe there is a threshold of mental and physical skills that must be met for hooping to occur. Like with reading. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;What if *reading* is the interest?&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If reading is the interest. If it is the act of solving the puzzle that is the written word, than other puzzles might also appeal. There is no way to get someone to read before they are ready. But you can come up with alternatives, other things that are parallel, perhaps, to reading. If reading is in it and of itself the interest looking at why that is interesting. I have a fair few books about different writing systems because Simon was interested in hieroglyphics. He knew Braille before he could read and we wrote notes in Braille together. He liked code. And he didn&#39;t need to read to play around with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":547876783,"authorName":"Mrs Jones","from":"Mrs Jones &lt;m.jones545@...&gt;","profile":"m.jones545@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Answering other questions","postDate":"1357251676","msgId":70095,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNTcyNTE2NzYuNzIxNTcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE3MTgwMS5tYWlsLmlyMi55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhNZVctelFOMlJmTXMzWGJMa05qSzRUREg1aUtrODRKbU0zRXF5UjQxU2I4UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDVGRDc0REYxLTFEQUMtNDEwOS1BNjI1LTZDMEY0N0M5MzNGN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPENBT09UYVhOOFNqTnd4X1NhbmtGcVE5WXZkdDk4RlZldlA9UDRpZ25xREszSzVQMjhMZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDBGRkI4RUFBLTlERjEtNDI5MS04M0UwLUZDMEVFM0M1OTIwQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQU9PVGFYTWVXLXpRTjJSZk1zM1hiTGtOaks0VERINWlLazg0Sm1NM0VxeVI0MVNiOFFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70094,"nextInTopic":70096,"prevInTime":70094,"nextInTime":70096,"topicId":70084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... child actually is ready.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-719335703\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt; because teaching isn&#39;t necessary if the<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>child actually is ready.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI obviously agree with this, but don&#39;t you think, that one can still decide to learn something one is not totally ready for?

Learning to read isn&#39;t different from learning anything else, in that a child can have a desire to acquire a specific skill, and be willing to study or receive instruction to obtain that skill.

It sounds very set in stone :)<br/>\nInstruction isn&#39;t by definition causing damage. Unsollicited instruction is highly likely to, but that&#39;s something very different from help that is asked for. If my child asks for my help, even if that is &quot;mom, teach me to read please&quot;,  then I am not harming the partnership in any way, because I am invited to &quot;teach&quot; and as long as I don&#39;t take over the learning process and push it further or in another direction than what is asked for, then my child is still in charge of his learning project. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot everything has to be learnt by osmosis/autodidact. Imo, formal instruction has it&#39;s place in unschooling too, as long as it is wanted. I sometimes get the feeling that you think learning &quot;on your own&quot; is somehow superior to receiving instruction. Is this so? Or is it mainly with regards to reading you feel this way?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaria<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Answering other questions","postDate":"1357244887","msgId":70089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPKzg1LStxLURmK0xXREI0SEJyUTJKOW43N18zZ2pqV0I9Y3RTSnN0S0RHd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDBGRkI4RUFBLTlERjEtNDI5MS04M0UwLUZDMEVFM0M1OTIwQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDVGRDc0REYxLTFEQUMtNDEwOS1BNjI1LTZDMEY0N0M5MzNGN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPENBT09UYVhOOFNqTnd4X1NhbmtGcVE5WXZkdDk4RlZldlA9UDRpZ25xREszSzVQMjhMZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDBGRkI4RUFBLTlERjEtNDI5MS04M0UwLUZDMEVFM0M1OTIwQkBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":70088,"nextInTopic":70090,"prevInTime":70088,"nextInTime":70090,"topicId":70084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Thu, Jan 3, 2013 at 11:53 AM, Kelly Halldorson ...

If you want to do another whole podcast about that someday, I&#39;d be willing, but it might be better if you avoid asking me about  &quot; a freedom-based&quot; anything. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of it is easily doable.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- There was something about a mom teaching her kids to read packaged foods - to see what&#39;s in it. And she says, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m gonna need to learn to read.&quot; -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy can&#39;t the mom read to the child?<br/>\nNo child can learn to read before she&#39;s capable, and there are many things that need to be in place before reading can happen.<br/>\nNo child can keep from reading once all those skills are developed, *unless* she&#39;s been pressured and wasn&#39;t ready and has been told or decided she&#39;s &quot;a non-reader.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny talk of a mom teaching a child anything (reading or anything else) is going to lead me to this<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/wordswords\">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>\nso if you want to stick with your other topics, avoid questions about teaching, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you WANT to go to that, I&#39;m willing.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________<br/>\n<br/>\nThe part about reading is really what reminded me of the panel and why we (as someone said--who said?) tend to answer the question we think the person SHOULD have asked. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70067,"nextTopicId":70211}}
