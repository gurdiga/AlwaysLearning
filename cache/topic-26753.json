I think they&#39;re setting them loose on other <br/>\nchildren, other women.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I agree.  That would be a terrible thing to do in the case of rape or<br/>\nany type of violence.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, when it comes to the buying and selling of horses (not feeling<br/>\nbadly here, just trying to explain) there are a whole slew of things that<br/>\ncome into play that aren&#39;t as cut and dried as something like rape.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBuyer beware.  I don&#39;t think anyone goes into a horse transaction without<br/>\nknowing this.  Most horse sellers don&#39;t point out the horses faults as much<br/>\nas they shine a light on their good qualities.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the thing is (and I knew this) a horse may not be the same for you as he<br/>\nwas for his last owner/rider.  He may not like you.  He may not like the way<br/>\nyou ride.  He may not have had a lot asked of him before and so he never got<br/>\nin huff enough to complain. (be rude or buck) Then you buy him and ask him<br/>\nto work off your leg and on the bit and suddenly he baulks and things can<br/>\nchange quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes horse sellers are just plain ignorant.  It&#39;s also possible that<br/>\nshe had owned this horse (for 8 years, she said) and it WAS quiet for her<br/>\nand so she had no reason to think we would return her.  She used the horse<br/>\nas a trail horse, showed her some, and she was an adult riding the horse<br/>\nwith long legs.  My dd is small, even for an 8 year old. (she was 8 then,<br/>\nalmost 9).  The horse hadn&#39;t had children on her very much and not a child<br/>\nwho knew what they were doing and asked a lot of her.  (which is why I<br/>\nwanted a trial period)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the woman did disappear after telling us we had three weeks in which<br/>\nto return her.  I made a couple mistakes there.  I did not get it in<br/>\nwriting.  I also paid in full for the horse instead of putting a down<br/>\npayment down or withholding payment until I found out if she worked out.<br/>\nShe did tell me in an email the other day that she did get my letters<br/>\neventually (months later because she&#39;s an over the road trucker now and<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get her mail for months) but she assumed after reading the second one<br/>\nthat things had worked out.  In the first letter I told her I wanted to<br/>\nreturn the horse (explained why).  In the second I said, &quot;haven&#39;t heard from<br/>\nyou..things are looking a bit better but I NEED to talk with you.  PLEASE<br/>\nCALL ME.&quot;  (we still weren&#39;t sure if she&#39;d work out or not because she was<br/>\ndoing better for a time but if given the chance I&#39;d have returned her<br/>\nbecause I wasn&#39;t looking for a horse we had to work with)  She took the &quot;a<br/>\nbit better and decided not to call.&quot;  After that I continued to call the X<br/>\nseveral times and even let him know we were selling the horse.  He told me<br/>\nhe&#39;d pass the word on.  (She had put in the contract that she wanted first<br/>\noption to buy her back if we sold her, isn&#39;t that sweet? Was it just bait?<br/>\nOr did she really care?) But in talking to the woman who sold us the horse,<br/>\nshe said she was fighting with her X at the time and he never gave her the<br/>\nmessages.  Messy!  Not really very cut and dried at all.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe horse was quiet and good the three times we tried her at the X&#39;s house.<br/>\n(different times of the day)  After the first buck (second time dd rode her<br/>\nafter we got her home) she had a quiet spell but then after spooking and<br/>\ntaking off on her once, she quickly came to realize she got out of work when<br/>\nshe did that.  Her behavior escalated from cantering off (not an honest<br/>\nspook after the first one though) to cantering off, bucking, and then doing<br/>\na buck/rear/spinny thing.  She was a smart horse and figured out how to get<br/>\nLilly off her.  Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t know anyone at the time with the<br/>\nability to ride her and work her through it.  A couple of more advanced<br/>\nstudents tried to but quickly decided they couldn&#39;t handle her.  I was<br/>\nriding her at the time (I&#39;m still a beginner) at walk/trot and not asking a<br/>\nlot of her and she was fine for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the woman REALLY cared about the horse, she wouldn&#39;t have disappeared<br/>\nwithout giving us a head&#39;s up as to how we could get a hold of her.  (She<br/>\nhas two kids who live with the X, there must be a way through the trucking<br/>\nco. plus she said she was moving.a new phone number would have been good)<br/>\nShe was a rat, no doubt about it.  She didn&#39;t want the horse back, imo, just<br/>\nthe money.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDid she move back to Maine and buy horses this summer and then use her work<br/>\nas an excuse to *have* to sell them?  It looks like it.  Do I think she just<br/>\nbought them to turn around and sell them again and make some money?  Yes. A<br/>\nlot of people buy horses cheap and work with them and resell them.  Is it<br/>\njust a little white lie as to why she says she&#39;s selling the horses?<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a complicated thing is all I am trying to say.  I don&#39;t think I would<br/>\nhave a leg to stand on in a court of law and I don&#39;t think even taking her<br/>\nto court in this part of the country would affect her anymore than spreading<br/>\nthe word about what happened through the horse world. It certainly isn&#39;t a<br/>\nheadliner. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] you owe me an apology!","postDate":"1155344576","msgId":26780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhBQzlCOTVFLTUyNEQtNDcyRi04OTNGLUJFQkFBMTUxMUVCQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwNDQwMWM2YmRhNyRiMWNiMzJmMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4=","referencesHeader":"PDAwNDQwMWM2YmRhNyRiMWNiMzJmMCQ2NTAwYThjMEBlYm9ueT4="},"prevInTopic":26778,"nextInTopic":26787,"prevInTime":26779,"nextInTime":26781,"topicId":26753,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-.

My youngest is just the most confident person <br/>\nsometimes. I still have issues with being a people pleaser and not <br/>\nwanting to upset people, even if it&#39;s just the truth that hurts.<br/>\n<br/>\n   Last summer we bought a horse and the owner of the horse gave us <br/>\nthree weeks in which to return her if she wasn&#39;t a good match for <br/>\nLilly. Well, on day six I tried to call her becaue Lilly had been <br/>\nbucked off and the horses ground manners had gone down the tube and I <br/>\njust knew she was not the horse she had seemed to be when we tried her. <br/>\n(3 times) We were looking for a VERY quiet horse which the woman had <br/>\nsaid this horse was.<br/>\n<br/>\n   When we tried the horse it was at the woman&#39;s x-husband&#39;s house. She <br/>\nsaid she&#39;d be living there for three more weeks. We had his number, her <br/>\ncell phone number, and her mailing address which was a p.o. box. For <br/>\nweeks I tried to get ahold of her. The X said she moved to NC and there <br/>\nwas no way to get a hold of her. Her cell phone kept saying it was out <br/>\nof order. I wrote several letters and got no response. The X had said <br/>\nhe would pass on my messages (I called at least 6 times) but I never <br/>\nheard back.<br/>\n<br/>\n   We ended up trading the horse last January to a trainer who had a <br/>\nvery difficult time with her before she finally made some headway. She <br/>\nreared and bucked and spun, etc. (she had done that for us too) The ad <br/>\nwe responded to was for a VERY SAFE horse. Anyway,...<br/>\n<br/>\n   We recently found 3 more horse ads on-line by the same woman (just by <br/>\nchance) who was living in Maine again. (still?) My dd decided to write <br/>\nto her and call her on her lies to us. My &quot;don&#39;t upset people&quot; <br/>\npersonality didn&#39;t want the conflict but dd was adamant about it. I let <br/>\nher do it. She really called her on everything lie she told us and <br/>\nasked her to explain herself. She was telling the same story she told <br/>\nus in the new ads about why she had to sell the horses that she&#39;d <br/>\nsupposedly had a long time. Well, she wrote back and instead of <br/>\nexplaining herself or feeling badly for her shitty lies, she berated my <br/>\ndd for &quot;talking to her like that and told her that she owed her an <br/>\napology.&quot; (you can bet if I&#39;d have written that letter she&#39;d not have <br/>\nasked for an apology because I am an adult) What a joke! Me, I felt <br/>\nlike I&#39;d been yelled at in school even though everything my dd had said <br/>\nto her was deserved and SPOT ON. My dd let her words roll off her like <br/>\nwater off a duck. It made NO impact at all except to cement what an <br/>\nidiot and liar the woman is.<br/>\n<br/>\n   She has none of the issues that I have with regards to *athority*. <br/>\nShe calls a spade a spade. I think it&#39;s so cool that she can stand up <br/>\nfor herself, with a valid arguement, and not feel less than when <br/>\nconfronting an adult just because they are an adult.<br/>\n<br/>\n   I ended up corresponding with the woman and she made up some excuses <br/>\nas to what happened to her and why she never responded. Whatever. I <br/>\nneeded to feel like things were smoothed over somewhat though because I <br/>\nhave a fear that someone like that might go balistic one day and I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want me or my kids on that person&#39;s hit list.

Unfortunately, I doubt I would have a foot<br/>\nhold in court and honestly it wouldn&#39;t be worth the trouble as much as I<br/>\nwould like to stop this woman from doing the same thing to another family.<br/>\n(However, the horse world is a small place and word does get around) I did<br/>\nnot get the return policy in writing.  (big mistake- I learned and haven&#39;t<br/>\nrepeated that mistake again)  The bill of sale was &quot;as is&quot;.  The return<br/>\npolicy was a verbal agreement between us, her word against mine probably,<br/>\nalthough I did have a witness.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course now I don&#39;t own the horse anymore either, so I can&#39;t give it back<br/>\nto get my money back.  I also had to pay board on the horse for several<br/>\nmonths before I could find a buyer who would buy a horse that I told them<br/>\nbucked and had issues.  It&#39;s not easy to sell a horse like that.  I ended up<br/>\ntrading her for an older pony, which was a pretty big loss monetarily but<br/>\nmoney wasn&#39;t the only thing I considered.  I knew the horse was going to a<br/>\nhome where they could handle her and correct her behavior issues, it got me<br/>\nout from under board payments, and I felt strongly that the old pony we got<br/>\nwould be a safe mount for my dd and if not that he would be easier to sell<br/>\neven if I couldn&#39;t get as much for him.  When you board you have to take<br/>\ninto consideration the monthly cost of board when you hold on to them month<br/>\nafter month.  He is the sweetest old boy though and we wouldn&#39;t have found<br/>\nhim if it wasn&#39;t for the other horse because he wasn&#39;t listed for sale<br/>\nanywhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne good thing happened from the correspondence yesterday.  My dd, who had<br/>\nheld a lot of anger toward the horse and the previous owner, was able to let<br/>\nit go and move past it.  She actually said she feels love for the horse that<br/>\nwe sold and wasn&#39;t sure why.  We are going to go visit her soon.  I think<br/>\nshe was able to let go of the pain that was associated with the whole thing<br/>\nand stop blaming it on the horse by confronting the previous owner who had<br/>\nlied to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI had more thoughts to add about this but the girls are getting ready to<br/>\nride and I am off to help them, then they are babysitting my nephew for a<br/>\nfew hours for some extra money.  If we have time between those two events,<br/>\nwe&#39;ll go see the horse that we sold.

I was sued<br/>\nby a drug company for $83,000. I was sued because my husband was employed as<br/>\na doctor at a clinic that didn&#39;t pay their pharmacy bill. He had nothing to<br/>\ndo with it. I had nothing to do with it. But it didn&#39;t stop us from being<br/>\nnamed in the suit. We live in a community property state, which is why I was<br/>\nnamed as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis law suit was bogus from the start. I do not like controversy, similar<br/>\nto you. But I had no choice about this. If I didn&#39;t do anything about it,<br/>\nthey win, take whatever they can from me. I was forced to go beyond my<br/>\ncomfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe lived a pretty simple and uncomplicated life in a small town in Ohio for<br/>\n12 years. We moved to a more metropolitan area (Phoenix) 4 years ago, which<br/>\nis when we realized that some people really DO make money and power their<br/>\npriority. Will lie and cheat and steal to get it. Seems obvious, but we had<br/>\nnever seen it upclose before irl.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t have much to take from, all the more reason to fight to keep it. Dh<br/>\nonly practices medicine that makes sense, not the kind that makes drug<br/>\ncompanies billions. This means he doesn&#39;t make what many doctors are thought<br/>\nto make moneywise.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we took on this drug company with help here and there from an atty when<br/>\nwe could afford it, and from a friend who is a paralegal, and I researched<br/>\nhow to legally respond to court documents and I prepared Statements of<br/>\nFacts, Motions, Affidavits, etc. I HATED it and at that same time I enjoyed<br/>\nit. I was doing something for personal justice, and I was learning about a<br/>\nsystem that is a large part of our society. In the end, I got the case<br/>\ndismissed because their attys made so many procedural mistakes. The drug<br/>\ncompany lost all their atty fees and had to pay court costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI benefited greatly from that process, in so many ways. I learned a whole<br/>\nlot about the legal system. I stayed strong and determined for what was<br/>\nright. I stuck to the truth no matter what else was flung my way. And in the<br/>\nend, we never even fought it out because I knew enough about the system by<br/>\nthen to show what they did wrong (didn&#39;t send me their evidence exhibits<br/>\nbefore the trial, didn&#39;t engage in court-assigned settlement procedure, et<br/>\nal). I would have loved to come to the end and had Mr. Judge determine the<br/>\ntruth, that I was not liable, but that was okay. All was well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people will just keep going and going in a hurtful pattern until they<br/>\nare stopped. I suspect that this woman of which you speak is one of them. I<br/>\nencourage you to do something legal about her Angela. It may give you<br/>\ndiscomfort initially, but  this may also be an opportunity for you to<br/>\nrelease some of that. Maybe it is effecting other areas in your life too?<br/>\n<br/>\nHorsewoman relies on people not doing anything to her. She knows that most<br/>\npeople will just complain and get mad, but they won&#39;t legally go after her.<br/>\n<br/>\nCourt and law can seem like big ominous things, but so many con artists<br/>\ncount on people thinking and feeling this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne option is to go to small claims court which has a nominal fee<br/>\ninvolved...you used to be able to sue someone for $2500 or less in Ohio in<br/>\nsmall claims court. The cost was $25.

My youngest is just the most confident person sometimes. I still have issues with being a people pleaser and not wanting to upset people, even if it&#39;s just the truth that hurts.<br/>\nLast summer we bought a horse and the owner of the horse gave us three weeks in which to return her if she wasn&#39;t a good match for Lilly. Well, on day six I tried to call her becaue Lilly had been bucked off and the horses ground manners had gone down the tube and I just knew she was not the horse she had seemed to be when we tried her. (3 times) We were looking for a VERY quiet horse which the woman had said this horse was.<br/>\nWhen we tried the horse it was at the woman&#39;s x-husband&#39;s house. She said she&#39;d be living there for three more weeks. We had his number, her cell phone number, and her mailing address which was a p.o. box. For weeks I tried to get ahold of her. The X said she moved to NC and there was no way to get a hold of her. Her cell phone kept saying it was out of order. I wrote several letters and got no response. The X had said he would pass on my messages (I called at least 6 times) but I never heard back.<br/>\nWe ended up trading the horse last January to a trainer who had a very difficult time with her before she finally made some headway. She reared and bucked and spun, etc. (she had done that for us too) The ad we responded to was for a VERY SAFE horse. Anyway,...<br/>\nWe recently found 3 more horse ads on-line by the same woman (just by chance) who was living in Maine again. (still?) My dd decided to write to her and call her on her lies to us. My &quot;don&#39;t upset people&quot; personality didn&#39;t want the conflict but dd was adamant about it. I let her do it. She really called her on everything lie she told us and asked her to explain herself. She was telling the same story she told us in the new ads about why she had to sell the horses that she&#39;d supposedly had a long time. Well, she wrote back and instead of explaining herself or feeling badly for her shitty lies, she berated my dd for &quot;talking to her like that and told her that she owed her an apology.&quot; (you can bet if I&#39;d have written that letter she&#39;d not have asked for an apology because I am an adult) What a joke! Me, I felt like I&#39;d been yelled at in school even though everything my dd had said to her was deserved and SPOT ON. My dd let her words roll off her like water off a duck. It made NO impact at all except to cement what an idiot and liar the woman is.<br/>\nShe has none of the issues that I have with regards to *athority*. She calls a spade a spade. I think it&#39;s so cool that she can stand up for herself, with a valid arguement, and not feel less than when confronting an adult just because they are an adult.<br/>\nI ended up corresponding with the woman and she made up some excuses as to what happened to her and why she never responded. Whatever. I needed to feel like things were smoothed over somewhat though because I have a fear that someone like that might go balistic one day and I don&#39;t want me or my kids on that person&#39;s hit list. (my issue, I know)<br/>\n--<br/>\nAngela<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26786,"nextTopicId":26795}}
