Although he knows how to operate both<br/>\nappliances safely, i&#39;ve been reluctant to take off the locks &quot;for his<br/>\nsafety&quot; (& my convenience, honestly) but I think, after reading this<br/>\nthread, that perhaps the time for those &quot;limits&quot; has passed.<br/>\nThank you!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI always learn something unexpected here!<br/>\nKristin<br/>\n<br/>\nPam said-<br/>\n&quot;Kids can learn about foods and their own needs and safety and health the<br/>\nsame way they learn to be safe in the out-of-doors or in a kitchen or near<br/>\na lake. Maybe try to consider it that way. Give them opportunities to<br/>\nlearn.<br/>\nToo much restriction, control, and limiting is counterproductive to<br/>\nhelping them learn. Conventional parenting does a LOT of controlling and<br/>\nlimiting - often so much that it results in<br/>\nserious shut-downs of learning processes and creates resistance or apathy<br/>\nin the developing child..&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEli&#39;s been expressing resistance to toilet & potty use, maybe taking the<br/>\nlock off will have a positive effect....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66178,"nextTopicId":66146}}
