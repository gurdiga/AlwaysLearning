I just<br/>\nlearned about Unschooling a few years ago. My two oldest children were<br/>\nnever homeschooled (the oldest graduated from college last year and<br/>\nthe second one will graduate next year). My third child went through<br/>\n10th grade and then decided she wanted to come home last year. She<br/>\nwent back to school a few months at the beginning of this year and<br/>\nthen decided she wanted to come home again. My fourth child went to<br/>\nschool until third grade and then was homeschooled through sixth. He<br/>\ndecided he wanted to go to the school for seventh grade where my<br/>\nhusband teaches and tested into the 8th grade. Now he is in 11th.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am guilty, especially since I first started reading the Unschooling<br/>\nadvice of Sandra (and Joyce, Pam S. and Pam L...), of trying to ingest<br/>\nas much information as I could without taking a breather. I did not<br/>\ntake the advice to &quot;read a little, wait a little, watch...&quot;. As a<br/>\nresult, I do not think our journey into Unschooling has been as smooth<br/>\na transition as it could have been. I have always been an attachment<br/>\nparent (family bed, extended breastfeeding, no set bedtimes, food<br/>\navailable when hungry etc.) so some of the advice has been implemented<br/>\nflawlessly. I understand the difference between &quot;principles&quot; and<br/>\n&quot;rules&quot;. There are other areas that I really struggle in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most challenging aspects of our family is having a child<br/>\nthat goes to a conventional school and children that are home and that<br/>\nare free to learn at their own pace and follow their passions. I think<br/>\nit is also challenging for my husband because he is a math teach and<br/>\nvarsity swim coach at that same, very &quot;academically rigorous&quot;, school.<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s paradigm about learning has been changing as well and I<br/>\nthink he would like to be working in some other area but that<br/>\nopportunity has not materialized yet (even though he has been actively<br/>\nlooking).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning (and it has happened several days in a row), my fourth<br/>\nchild did not get up in time to go with his father to school (they<br/>\nhave to leave at 5:30 every morning because varsity swim practice is<br/>\nat 6 before school starts). My son is in danger of not getting credit<br/>\nfor his classes because he is getting close to having missed 10 days.<br/>\nI tried to encourage him to go anyway (even if he missed his first<br/>\nclass) so that he could be marked &quot;present&quot; for the other courses. He<br/>\nbroke down and said that it was &quot;too late&quot;. I wrote my husband and<br/>\ntold him that I would be willing to be the &quot;wake up&quot; person (and make<br/>\nsure that he has his uniform ready, breakfast etc.) since I know how<br/>\nhard it is for my son to get up that early.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband wrote me in an email that &quot;...And by the way, if you let<br/>\nhim go out tonight with friends and not do any work all day long, that<br/>\nis horrible parenting; I completely disapprove if that is what is<br/>\ngoing to happen.  It&#39;s time to get a little tough here.&quot; I feel caught<br/>\nin between loving, respecting, being gentle with my son and being<br/>\n&quot;tough&quot; like my husband feels I should be. At the same time, if my son<br/>\nwants to continue going to that school, there are certain rules that<br/>\nneed to be followed (even if he thinks they are unfair, ludicrous,<br/>\npoorly thought out...). I know he feels ambivalent about being there-<br/>\nwants to be there for the &quot;social&quot; aspects of school (he is very<br/>\n&quot;popular&quot; and is able to mingle with people that are very materially<br/>\nwealthy...)- but does not like putting in the &quot;required&quot; academic<br/>\nmuscle.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure how to navigate this situation in a way that shows that<br/>\nI respect and love both my husband and son. I do not know how to help<br/>\nkeep the peace between my husband and son. My husband interprets my<br/>\nson&#39;s &quot;lack of motivation&quot; as a &quot;lack of respect&quot; towards him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for any advice and thoughts of wisdom.
