Here is the problem:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My teeneage niece, whom I raised until she was 6,<br/>\n&gt; wants to come and live with us and go to college in<br/>\n&gt; Washington.  She and I have a very special elationship<br/>\n&gt; and we are more than happy to have her.  Neither <br/>\n&gt; of us think that her dysfunctional and irresponsible<br/>\n&gt; parents will stop her from leaving.  They will be glad<br/>\n&gt; for one less mouth to feed mostly, and have told her<br/>\n&gt; she is free to go whenever she is free from compulsory<br/>\n&gt; attendance in California and they will not be fined<br/>\n&gt; for truancy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What are her options for getting out of school in<br/>\n&gt; California and getting up here to Washington State to<br/>\n&gt; go to school (or not) as she decides?  In California<br/>\n&gt; she can take her CHSPE to test out, but she is test<br/>\n&gt; phobic.  She would like to see if there is an option<br/>\n&gt; for transferring up here to HS and then getting out<br/>\n&gt; based on Washington State requirements or<br/>\n&gt; alternatives, which she believes to be better (less<br/>\n&gt; hoops to jump through) than California.  Would this<br/>\n&gt; require a parental/guardianship change, or at 16 is<br/>\n&gt; she allowed to make that decision herself in WA??  How<br/>\n&gt; would she transfer from there to here, simply change<br/>\n&gt; her address and move?  What are her options and her<br/>\n&gt; best course of action?  Can anyone point me in the<br/>\n&gt; right direction for finding the information?  I am not<br/>\n&gt; having a lot of luck online.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right now she is in a Home-Study program in California<br/>\n&gt; (like independent study.)  She is an Honor Student<br/>\n&gt; from 1st grade, Presidential Honor Roll student, and<br/>\n&gt; Rainbow Scholar, from a below poverty level family. <br/>\n&gt; She is female and 1/4 Japanese, 1/4 Arabic, so she <br/>\n&gt; qualifies for scholorships and aid on several levels,<br/>\n&gt; if that helps.  She really wants to get out of the<br/>\n&gt; compulsory system and away from her awful home life. <br/>\n&gt; She is very bright.  I would appreciate any help or<br/>\n&gt; advice anyone has to offer.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Nanci K. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1352017,"authorName":"kayb85","from":"&quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;sheran@...&gt;","profile":"kayb85","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Urgent!

Maybe you could find a list specific to <br/>\nCalifornia homeschooling that would answer your question if no one on <br/>\nthis list is sure. I could answer your question if she lived in <br/>\nPennsylvania, but I don&#39;t know California law.  If she lived in <br/>\nPennsylvania, the parents would have to sign the affidavit stating <br/>\nthat she is homeschooled and they are the supervisors of her program, <br/>\nbut they can have anyone teach her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to look into would be making her an emancipated minor. <br/>\n<br/>\nSheila<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In AlwaysLearning@y..., Nanci Kuykendall &lt;aisliin@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Help!
