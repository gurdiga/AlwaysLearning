She <br/>\nfound NBTSC extremely inspiring and has made friendships that have lasted <br/>\noutside of camp.  As a matter of fact, we just had &#39;The Canadians&#39; here to <br/>\nvisit for several days.  Lovely young people.  My 14yo son will go this <br/>\nyear for his first time and is very excited. He considers it a &#39;must-do&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI visited the camp myself and spent an entire day roaming the campus with <br/>\nno influence except my daughter (when she wasn&#39;t busy talking to <br/>\ncamper-friends.)  It was a beautiful forested setting, and being fall, was <br/>\nnippier than I would like (but then I usually like it about 74 <br/>\ndegrees!)  The day I was there, they sent the remote-controlled submersible <br/>\nrobot (that they&#39;d built themselves!) out into the pond for the very first <br/>\ntime - and it worked!  Even though we weren&#39;t expected (we didn&#39;t RSVP), <br/>\nthey graciously made room for us at the table.  The food was more <br/>\nholy-granola-y than I am used to, but it was good and lots of kids went <br/>\nback for seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe camp (and group?) is obviously not a good fit for every child, nor for <br/>\nevery family.  No group ever is.  Please don&#39;t take one parent&#39;s experience <br/>\nof the camp (even mine) for the sum total of camp quality.  Check it out <br/>\nfor yourself and talk to a lot of people!  Shoot, if you go to the NBTSC <br/>\nwebsite, there&#39;s even some teen forums where you can ask the teens what <br/>\nthey think.<br/>\nFirst Hand Info, without the parental slant.<br/>\nPriceless!<br/>\nHeidiWD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;wow, 130,000 troops on the ground, nearly 500 deaths and over a billion <br/>\ndollars a day, but they caught a guy living in a hole. am i supposed to be <br/>\ndazzled?&quot;<br/>\nEmail sent by an SPC in the US Army who wishes to remain anonymous.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17864,"nextTopicId":17878}}
