There are limits in any relationship.  And those limits are<br/>\ndifferent in every relationship.  If a child or an adult is causing harm and<br/>\nwe don&#39;t limit it, the child or adult may not understand that they are<br/>\ncausing harm, may believe that the harm they are causing is ok, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the unschooling issue comes in with HOW you limit.  If any child or<br/>\nany adult told me to &quot;shut up&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t threaten to hit them, I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nthreaten to take away priviledges.....I would say &quot;That was a very rude<br/>\nthing to say to me.  I don&#39;t want you to talk to me that way.

So I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m not going to jump all over my son<br/>\n&gt; for picking the words &quot;shut up&quot;, that may even make him think his<br/>\n&gt; opinion doesn&#39;t matter or perhaps he shouldn&#39;t experiment with any<br/>\n&gt; new words with mommy.

He could say it knowingly that he wasn&#39;t being nice<br/>\n&gt; because of some other issue intirely! In my opinion it is better to<br/>\n&gt; talk about things rather than just pick out certain words that my<br/>\n&gt; son isn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to say. I know my son isn&#39;t perfect (I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; certainly not) and I know he is going to make occasional poor<br/>\n&gt; choices in his words or actions and I feel it is more my job to<br/>\n&gt; model, show him a better way, or talk about it rather than it is to<br/>\n&gt; degrade or limit him.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; You said &quot;Can we go now?&quot; is what my kids would say if they wanted<br/>\n&gt; to go.

He was &quot;tactile defensive&quot; and<br/>\nhis cues for what he needed were MUCH different from my other children. He<br/>\nwas often inconsolable as a baby, and my instinct to cuddle and nurse him<br/>\nwas the opposite of what he wanted. He nursed for hunger, but did not<br/>\nusually seek it out for comfort. It was very confusing and disheartening to<br/>\nme. My earth momma ego was definitely bruised :) He was my first, so I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have comparisons at the time except for the babies I had worked with<br/>\nbefore, which is much different from having your own. He was eventually<br/>\ndiagnosed with high-functioning autism later on, when we wanted to get some<br/>\nservices from the state. It was very helpful to look it up on the internet<br/>\nand get lots of information of things people had experienced and what helped<br/>\ntheir children. Ultimately though, I think that there are a myriad of<br/>\ndifferent personality types, and the diagnoses are often a way to see how<br/>\nsome of those personalities do or don&#39;t fit into the box called &quot;public<br/>\nschool system&quot;. But I digress :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;his physical aggression (though never really taken out on anyone else,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>just with himself) turned to verbal aggression with &gt;&gt;family members when<br/>\nupset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest that you not allow him to hurt himself as well as not<br/>\nhurting others.

This was a transformative experience for<br/>\nall of us. They sometimes stored up their hurts or excitements for that time<br/>\nalone with one of us. It would be great if we could give that kind of<br/>\nattention all the time, but with the logistics of life, it doesn&#39;t always<br/>\nhappen. Having a time that they could count on gave them an ability to hold<br/>\ntheir frustrations for a time that was safe, and saved some &quot;victims&quot; of<br/>\ntheir bad feelings.

I think your inclination to help the victim is a<br/>\ngood one, and if you only have ability in the moment to take care of one,<br/>\nthen taking care of the victim is probably the way to go.

I am saving all of these posts to refer back to often in times when I need some ideas. <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s especially nice to hear about your son, Jaki, who is now older and has had these very intense emotional outbursts like I&#39;m experiencing. My son, Liam, was born intense. At about 15 months he started throwing himself down on the ground, kicking and screaming, when things were not as he needed them to be. I wondered what the heck was happening, because my first child never, EVER, did anything even remotely related to an episode such as this. The hardest and scariest thing for me, as a mother, was that even at that very young age he would never let me touch or console him. I would just sit with him, feeling so helpless, until he was done and would come up and finally snuggle and nurse with me. But, it was always on his terms, and if I tried to sing, speak softly, or touch him he would loose it even more. This continued until he was into his 3&#39;s (peaking between 15 months-3 yrs and then tapering off until he was around 4).<br/>\n <br/>\nOnce he turned 4 he really seemed to hit an even streak. During these times I read a gillion books (all LLL-ish books, as I am a local leader and that was my resource), and tried and tried to give him words to match his feelings, etc. Then, as Danielle mentioned, his physical aggression (though never really taken out on anyone else, just with himself) turned to verbal aggression with family members when upset. And, also, he is just really strong and literally doesn&#39;t know his strength with his 3 yo brother who is much more slight and petite than my very muscular 5 yo. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe do tell lots of stories about people learning to use their strength wisely  (like Hercules) and I watch for movies that might have these themes as well. I like Sandra&#39;s idea of martial arts, we will look into that in the future. He just started soccer, and this is his first &quot;activity&quot; away from home which is a big deal for him. He may not be quite ready yet for a structured class as martial arts, but we will see. Also, getting him away and focusing attention ON HIM when (or ideally right before he melts down) is ideal. My main struggle is my natural inclination is to focus on the victim, and I&#39;m usually juggling the younger children at the same time. I am going to make a big effort to make sure I can do this much more often (especially here before the baby comes), and try to make that connection with him in the moment, even if it&#39;s just sitting with him quietly as it was when he was a baby. <br/>\n <br/>\nAlso, I can relate to Jaki as all of those &quot;well meaning&quot; family members are so concerned that &quot;I allow&quot; this out of control behavior and say often they are concerned about what kind of older child and adult he will be. I just think that&#39;s horrible. It&#39;s certainly not like I&#39;m saying &quot;well, whatever, he&#39;ll work it out on his own&quot;, I&#39;m trying different things, and most importantly my heart is there with him trying to help in ways that I know how. I KNOW he knows this and that is most important. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve always felt that Liam was born with such a great Spirit and has had a bit of a harder time adjusting to this earthly world than some others have. I do CHOOSE to always see Liam surrounded by Light and beauty and for the wonderful, creative, powerful person/soul that he is. Thank you all so much for your words, they have helped me greatly!<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nKristina<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] children hurting with their words","postDate":"1096848161","msgId":21029,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHS0VERUNLQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDAyMDIwMjMxLjczOTM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21028,"nextInTopic":21031,"prevInTime":21028,"nextInTime":21030,"topicId":21021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Kristina, My now 14 year old Max had the most intense tantrums when he was 4 and 5.

In<br/>\nfact, I might even call them psychotic-looking (kidding! kidding! That was a<br/>\njoke in reference to an earlier thread that caused a big response!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned that the most important thing in the moment of intense emotion is<br/>\nto listen to the child. I like Sandra&#39;s suggestion to take him aside so as<br/>\nnot to upset others around you as much as possible, though the others<br/>\ncertainly can learn from watching how to handle rage with love. Becoming the<br/>\n&quot;victim&quot; of your son&#39;s behavior definitely takes the heat off everyone else<br/>\ntoo. But ideally, taking the problem away from others is probably a good<br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no talking &quot;sense&quot; to a child who is in the throws of emotions.<br/>\nThey need loving attention. It&#39;s usually not a good time to tell them how it<br/>\nmakes you feel. You have to take your triggers out of the equation. If what<br/>\nhe is saying bothers you in the moment, do your best to see that this is<br/>\nsimply a child in need of being listened to. You are his safe sounding<br/>\nboard. When he has a chance to let it out, he will be calmer, and that is a<br/>\ngreat time to re-evaluate the situation together.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he is saying these things without intense emotion, but instead with<br/>\nseeming intent to be mean, then I would simply intervene to stop the<br/>\nbehavior and then engage in discussion. Sometimes stopping the behavior will<br/>\nactually trigger strong emotion, and then that is a good opportunity for the<br/>\nchild to release feelings that need to get out of the way. They are probably<br/>\nthe crux of what is driving his negative behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have had family meeting discussions in general about mean talk. Everyone<br/>\nhas a chance to say how they feel when different things are said to them.<br/>\nGive examples that are close to what you hear your guy(s) say as part of the<br/>\ndiscussion. In a safe environment, the &quot;victims&quot; and &quot;abusers&quot; can each say<br/>\ntheir thoughts and hear how others are effected. You may even get to<br/>\nbrainstorm ideas of what to do when:<br/>\n-feeling like you want to say something mean to someone<br/>\n-someone says something mean to you<br/>\n-you hear someone being mean to someone else<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nComing up with ideas together can help everyone feel like they have been<br/>\npart of the problem-solving, and help enroll everyone in making the<br/>\nsituation better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that a couple of your children may be too young for participating<br/>\nin discussions. If they see it happening at an early age though, they will<br/>\ngrow with a great example of how to work things out together.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son Max turned into a mild-mannered, deep thinking individual. His<br/>\noccasional babysitter back then told me that she was very worried he had the<br/>\npersonality of a future axe murderer (yes, she was canned). Fortunately, I<br/>\nhad supportive people reminding me not to not be scared, it was not a<br/>\npermanent thing, he just had feelings to get rid of, and to just keep<br/>\nlistening lovingly, and keep asking for help when I was stuck. I think that<br/>\nadvise was right on. It sounds like you do a lot of this already! I so<br/>\nremember trying to get through tantrums without losing it myself. When the<br/>\ntantrum was over, I learned to call a trusted friend to vent all the things<br/>\nthat it brought up in me. That helped me be clearer for the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Kristina Kahney [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kkahney@...\">kkahney@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, October 01, 2004 7:03 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] children hurting with their words<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been lurking here and on UD for a couple of months (I think?) now, just<br/>\nabsorbing information and allowing myself to make a paradigm shift in<br/>\nregards to my children and my parenting. My kids are 7,5,3, 20 months and<br/>\nour fifth is due in a couple of weeks. We&#39;ve always been a very laid back<br/>\nand unstructured family, but I&#39;ve had things to let go of (and still do ;)<br/>\nin order to get to the place that I visualize for our family.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I struggle so much with is my children and the name calling<br/>\nissue. It centers around my 5 yo son, who is extremely intense...he can blow<br/>\nyou over with the Love that beams out of him and his kindness, or he can<br/>\nalso erupt in terrible frustration like a volcano. One thing he resorts to<br/>\nis saying things like &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;shutup&quot;,<br/>\netc. Unfortunately, some time back I have made the mistake of giving these<br/>\nphrases WAY too much power, but they are a hot button for me and my<br/>\nintelligent children certainly know it. Also, when their father gets mad, he<br/>\ntends to let things build up and then &quot;explode&quot; in the same way, and he is<br/>\nknown to say hurtful things to me and the children (probably one reason why<br/>\nspeaking this way is a hot button of mine...). Not the same phrases my 5 yo<br/>\nuses, but just saying hurtful things in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve already tried to do the &quot;controlling&quot; thing by sending them to cool off<br/>\nor taking something away when this happens. Ok, obviously a hell of alot of<br/>\ngood that approach did, LOL! I felt horrible after trying to manipulate them<br/>\nthis way and they had hurt feelings with me acting in such a manner as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor awhile, now, I have vowed to simply look at them in the eyes and tell<br/>\nthem how I feel when they do this....&quot; I don&#39;t like being spoken to with<br/>\nthose words. You sound (mad, angry, sad, etc..) tell me what&#39;s going on&quot;. To<br/>\nwhich, in the heat of the moment my 5 yo usually sticks his tongue out at me<br/>\nor screams something else in response. My 7 yo daughter doesn&#39;t do this, but<br/>\nmy 3 yo son is now learning from watching his brother. It just seems like<br/>\nthings are spiraling out of control with this issue, and my husband is<br/>\nblaming it all on me because &quot;I just let the kids do whatever they want<br/>\nwithout teaching them any respect&quot;. Ugh.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy friends IRL that I&#39;ve mentioned this too have all looked at me strangely<br/>\nsaying, &quot;gosh, my kids would NEVER say THAT!!&quot;. Well, that really helps,<br/>\nthanks! So, please give me your thoughts...be brutal I can take it.

My 6 yo occasionally tells me to &quot;Shut up&quot; and it is usually <br/>\nduring a situation where he feels like he would rather be doing <br/>\nsomething else but is stuck with a mom who is visiting with a <br/>\nfriend, etc. <br/>\n    Sometimes I reply with a simple - &quot;I will be able to stop <br/>\ntalking in just a minute and then we can get going, Thank you for <br/>\nbeing so patient with me&quot; and if it keeps up then later (after the <br/>\nfriend has left or take him aside alone) I will confirm his feelings <br/>\nthat he is ready to go, bored, wanting some attention for himself, <br/>\netc. whatever and I will ask that he would please try to let me know <br/>\nwhat is going on with him in a more polite way, and I may also <br/>\nremind him of how I am patient for him while he is looking at toys <br/>\netc. so perhaps that this could be a time he could be patient for me <br/>\netc. I think of it as the child not really understanding either the <br/>\npolite way of saying something or perhaps he is at a loss for better <br/>\nwords but feels strongly about a situation. <br/>\n    He went though a short phase (I look back and now it seems short <br/>\nbut I&#39;m sure at the time it seems an eternity) where he would yell <br/>\nsomething like &quot; I hate you &quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want you for my parent <br/>\nanymore&quot;, etc. and I was able to restate those for him like perhaps <br/>\nhe was saying he wanted to be able to have something for himself or <br/>\nperhaps he was just trying to say that he didn&#39;t agree with us and <br/>\nwhen I kept restating what he was saying with more appropriate <br/>\nexpressions then he was able to follow my model and now he rarely <br/>\nsays something totally inappropriate and in those cases he is <br/>\nusually noticably hungry or tired as well.<br/>\n    There was one instance before he really seemed to &quot;understand&quot; <br/>\nthat his words were capable of hurting me that he actually drove me <br/>\nto tears and then he asked me what I was crying for because he was <br/>\nthe one who was upset and so I told him that his words had hurt me, <br/>\netc. that was kind of a turning point for both of us, that he <br/>\nstarted to understand his words could hurt and I started to <br/>\nunderstand that he didn&#39;t realize what he was saying so I shouldn&#39;t <br/>\ntake it at face value, etc. The book the Explosive child  (by Green <br/>\nI think) gives some good examples about teaching a child better use <br/>\nof their own words, but I don&#39;t agree with everything from the book <br/>\n(especially his views on medicine or school)but that&#39;s like most <br/>\nbooks I read I take what is useful to me and leave what isn&#39;t.

My <br/>\nkids are 7, 5 and 4, and my 4 yo is extremely intense and explosive, <br/>\nvery much like you describe. When he was younger, much of his anger <br/>\nwould come out as aggression. Now that he&#39;s a bit older, he has shifted <br/>\ninto verbal aggression, which is a step better, but still aggression <br/>\nnonetheless. Part of my job as a mother, I believe, is to provide a <br/>\nsafe, nurturing environment for *all* my children, and it breaks my <br/>\nheart that there are times when it&#39;s a sibling I must protect them from. <br/>\nIt&#39;s so much easier when it&#39;s us against the world! *g*<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t reply to you right away because I&#39;ve been dealing with this <br/>\nvery issue myself and had no words of wisdom. I was soul-sick and <br/>\nlooking for my own support...  I still have no words or wisdom, but I do <br/>\nnow have the energy to commiserate and share some of what we&#39;re trying <br/>\nto do here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that my guy&#39;s rage seems to come in cycles. Things will be <br/>\nreally good for a while, then really bad for a while. I&#39;m still not <br/>\nquite sure what sends him into a tailspin. It may be that we get too <br/>\nbusy and stop honoring his need for down time; it may just be that he <br/>\nhas a threshold and once crossed needs to blow off steam for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that controlling and time-outs don&#39;t work--in fact it escalates <br/>\nthe behavior. I discovered a long time ago, that walking away from my <br/>\nguy while he was in one of his rages was the worst thing I could do to <br/>\nhim. The fear behind his eyes cut to my heart, and I could see that I <br/>\nwas abandoning him when he needed me most. That need can be difficult to <br/>\nsee when he doesn&#39;t want a hug or any kind of nurturing that I might try <br/>\nto give, but the need is for my presence to reassure him that he is not <br/>\nalone and that he is loved and that I will be there for him when he is <br/>\nready to be loved.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Sam says hateful things, my response is often, &quot;Please don&#39;t hurt <br/>\nme/Em/ Julia with your words. You must feel really mad to have to get it <br/>\nout like that, and you just need to get that hurt out, huh? Is there <br/>\nsomething I can do to help?&quot; Yes, lots of times the response is a <br/>\nguttural, back of the throat scream or a stick the tongue out raspberry. <br/>\nSome of the time, it&#39;s a melting, &quot;Yes, sorry mama&quot; and curl up in my <br/>\nlap. I wish I could make the latter response the norm, but that&#39;s up to <br/>\nhim not me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the important thing with small kids is just being there to <br/>\ncalmly, gently, immediately intervene, letting them all know that this <br/>\nis not how people can be treated within the family. Reasoning with Sam <br/>\nwhen he&#39;s raging is impossible, but talking with him after the fact <br/>\nabout his need for respect and the need for respect to work both ways <br/>\nis, I believe, helpful for the long run if not the immediate moment. <br/>\nWith younger children I really do believe that much of the work we do is <br/>\ngroundwork, the effects of which are long term rather than short term. <br/>\nYou&#39;re welcome to join us over at AlwaysUnschooled, where we talk a lot <br/>\nabout Unschooling issues with smaller children--under 8: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysUnschooled</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is a bit helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Danielle<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html\">http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":149995806,"authorName":"catherine aceto","from":"&quot;catherine aceto&quot; &lt;aceto3@...&gt;","profile":"cat4cat15217","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] children hurting with their words","postDate":"1096732571","msgId":21023,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzMwMWM0YTg5OCQ1NmYyYmFlMCQ4NjAyYThjMEAyMDAyZGVza3RvcD4=","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQxMDAyMDIwMjMxLjczOTM4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjgwNzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":21022,"nextInTopic":21025,"prevInTime":21022,"nextInTime":21024,"topicId":21021,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really liked Sandra s advice -- but also some other more short term things I thought of: In cases where he is saying these things to YOU - I have found that","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1252523954\">I really liked Sandra&#39;s advice -- but also some other more short term things I thought of: <br/>\n<br/>\nIn cases where he is saying these things to YOU - I have found that a mild &quot;really?&quot; can often diffuse the situation with my highly emotional nearly 7 yo - and picturing myself absorbing her anger, rather than reflecting it (or adding my own!). <br/>\n<br/>\n Sometimes after the crisis has passed, I follow up with the informational, &quot;it hurts my feelings when you say that I am mean and horrible and never do anything you want.  do you really feel like that?&quot;  Not in a shaming voice, and not in a long drawn out discussion - but as information.  My other child is only 2, so she has never yelled anything at him, but I think if she did I might do the same mild information that she probably hurt his feelings and did she really feel like that? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is just the words that bug you &quot;stupid&quot; &quot;shut-up&quot; &quot;I hate you&quot; that bother you -- can you get a book of Shakespearean insults or something and see if the two of you can come up with some more colorful but less hurtfully emotional words for him to use to blow off steam?  Maybe if he yelled something like  &quot;you puling poltroon&quot; it would feel less hurtful to all involved because the words had less emotional power? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I liked about Sandra&#39;s advice, is that it was long-term advice on how not to grow up into a person who holds things in and then explodes - my advice is more about managing the moment.   But I have noticed my own now nearly 7 y.o., seems to simply be growing out of many of those explosive name-calling behaviors that she had when she was 5 (though she is still prone to melt-downs when overly stressed by things like noise or activitiy)  No one in her genetic line is prone to explosive, confrontive anger, though, so that may make a difference. <br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this helped. <br/>\n<br/>\n-Cat <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Kristina Kahney <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Friday, October 01, 2004 10:02 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] children hurting with their words<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n  One thing that I struggle so much with is my children and the name calling issue.

(But <br/>\nsomething you need to stay with the more wounded party, too, I know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby was our worst offender at saying something hurtful.   And it&#39;s hard (I <br/>\nremember myself) being an only (or in your child&#39;s case, a younger) and then <br/>\nbeing displaced before you were ready to give up your special mom-closeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would take Kirby aside and let him vent to me.  I&#39;d ask him why he was <br/>\nfrustrated, or why he was tired, or &quot;are you hungry?&quot; &quot;are you feeling sick?&quot; and <br/>\nbasically debrief him sympathetically, but at the same time help him form his <br/>\nown checklist of &quot;what&#39;s my problem?&quot;  (There are adults who could use an <br/>\ninner &quot;what&#39;s my problem?&quot; checklist. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m glad to have started developing one <br/>\nmyself, about the time I was 30.  Before that, if I was angry I thought I was <br/>\nentirely justified in being angry, and all factors were outside of me; I got <br/>\nbetter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have said to all my kids, but mostly Kirby on that case by case basis, that <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry if I have ever hurt them with words and made a bad memory they will <br/>\nhave always, and I&#39;m sorry for some things I said to my sister when we were <br/>\nlittle, that I could never ever take back.   I would say that thinking <br/>\nsomething mean without saying it ise peace of each of my children in his or her own <br/>\nhome insofar as I can, and I&#39;m not just here to protect them from outsiders, <br/>\naxe-murderers and boogie-men of whatever real or imagined sort, but from each <br/>\nother as well.   <br/>\n<br/>\nIt makes me crazy when I hear a mom say &quot;They need to learn to work these <br/>\nthings out for themselves.&quot;    It&#39;s such cop-out, and such disregard for both the <br/>\nunderdog kid AND the bullying kid, who is learning clearly that he can get <br/>\naway with what he can get away with, and his mother isn&#39;t going to interfere <br/>\nbecause she doesn&#39;t know or care how to make peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then what about families where the mom really doesn&#39;t know how to make <br/>\npeace?  Maybe then it&#39;s good to have rules and time-outs so the peace kind of <br/>\nkeeps itself a little more.  But I think if she can gain more peacemaking tools, <br/>\nit&#39;s better for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-One thing he resorts to is saying things like &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll kill <br/>\nyou&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;shutup&quot;, etc. Unfortunately, some time back I have made the <br/>\nmistake of giving these phrases WAY too much power, but they are a hot button <br/>\nfor me and my intelligent children certainly know it. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they phrases do have power.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is a big strong guy and learned early in his life that he had to <br/>\nliterally and figuratively pull his punches.   He COULD kill someone, and so he <br/>\nhad to learn to be patient and gentle, and to learn how to calm himself.  And <br/>\nall people who are trained to kill need (theoretically and ideally) to also <br/>\nlearn how not to WANT to kill, and not to pull it out except in the direst <br/>\nemergency.<br/>\n<br/>\nA desire to kill, with or without the knowledge and ability, isn&#39;t a healing, <br/>\nsoothing, thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend putting him in a martial arts class with a teacher who <br/>\nstresses control and patience.   When Kirby wanted to take karate, I called around <br/>\nand visited until I found a school that seemed peaceful and philosophical and <br/>\nhistorical, not all street-fighting-technique and tournament preparation.    <br/>\nAnd so now Kirby can take another person down without really thinking about it <br/>\nhard, but he has never laid a hand on another person (past when he was quite <br/>\nyounger and would try to strongarm Marty out of his room or away from his <br/>\nstuff).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Also, when their father gets mad, he tends to let things build up and then <br/>\n&quot;explode&quot; in the same way, and he is known to say hurtful things to me and <br/>\nthe children -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nGenetics.  <br/>\nWhat we saw in Kirby, we countered earliest with breathing.  <br/>\n&quot;Take a deep breath, Kirby and then when you calm down tell us what happened.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst the calming down, and then the report/complaint.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a more detailed account of the best way I found to deal with disputes <br/>\nwith kids.

Your other children are counting on you <br/>\nto make things better.   And those thoughts and meanness are coming from <br/>\nsomething real inside him that he needs to learn to control.    Spanking him will <br/>\nmake it worse.  Saying mean awful things to him too will make it worse.   <br/>\nPunishments and groundings and limits might make it worse.  But if you can figure <br/>\nout what to say to help him change his thinking, that could make it better.    <br/>\nHelping him think about times he was hurt by others&#39; words, or helping him find <br/>\nany sort of self-comfort, self-restraint tricks of his own are better for <br/>\nhim, for you, for your husband, and for the other kids.  Better for the <br/>\nneighbors.  Better for your son&#39;s future wife and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nKarate, if you can manage it.

One thing he resorts to is saying things like &quot;I hate you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;shutup&quot;, etc. Unfortunately, some time back I have made the mistake of giving these phrases WAY too much power, but they are a hot button for me and my intelligent children certainly know it. Also, when their father gets mad, he tends to let things build up and then &quot;explode&quot; in the same way, and he is known to say hurtful things to me and the children (probably one reason why speaking this way is a hot button of mine...). Not the same phrases my 5 yo uses, but just saying hurtful things in general. <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve already tried to do the &quot;controlling&quot; thing by sending them to cool off or taking something away when this happens. Ok, obviously a hell of alot of good that approach did, LOL! I felt horrible after trying to manipulate them this way and they had hurt feelings with me acting in such a manner as well. <br/>\n <br/>\nFor awhile, now, I have vowed to simply look at them in the eyes and tell them how I feel when they do this....&quot; I don&#39;t like being spoken to with those words. You sound (mad, angry, sad, etc..) tell me what&#39;s going on&quot;. To which, in the heat of the moment my 5 yo usually sticks his tongue out at me or screams something else in response. My 7 yo daughter doesn&#39;t do this, but my 3 yo son is now learning from watching his brother. It just seems like things are spiraling out of control with this issue, and my husband is blaming it all on me because &quot;I just let the kids do whatever they want without teaching them any respect&quot;. Ugh. <br/>\n <br/>\nMy friends IRL that I&#39;ve mentioned this too have all looked at me strangely saying, &quot;gosh, my kids would NEVER say THAT!!&quot;. Well, that really helps, thanks! So, please give me your thoughts...be brutal I can take it. I&#39;m tired, very pregnant, and just want to get along and have a more peaceful house (if that can ever happen with 5 kids, hehe!). <br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nKristina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20968,"nextTopicId":21075}}
