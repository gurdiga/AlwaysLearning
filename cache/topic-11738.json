I have friends in town who are<br/>\n&gt; French. I&#39;ve lived in France and speak French. I went to college in<br/>\n&gt; France for a year.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One of the French moms invited a number of homeschoolers<br/>\n&gt; over to meet other French mothers. They didn&#39;t know anything<br/>\n&gt; about homeschooling and asked us all kinds of questions. The<br/>\n&gt; most startling response to all our sharing was when one mother<br/>\n&gt; said,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Even if the education is inferior and even if the children don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; enjoy it, I would not want to pull my children out of the state<br/>\n&gt; funded programs to make them better than other people. We<br/>\n&gt; should all have the same education and not make some<br/>\n&gt; superior to others.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well tie my shoelaces!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Right there I saw the cultural absorption of the ideals of<br/>\n&gt; socialism. all the motehrs basically agreed with this position, yet<br/>\n&gt; they couldn&#39;t let go of their fascination with our way of doing<br/>\n&gt; things. It was enlightening.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One thing they also said was that their kids loved going to school<br/>\n&gt; in the states! They loved the way the students could get up and<br/>\n&gt; move around a classroom, the encouragement of group projects<br/>\n&gt; and the absence of ridicule as a method of motivation (very<br/>\n&gt; prevalent in France). They also preferred the way teachers used<br/>\n&gt; multi media to the typical workbook program all day.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; That was interesting. France made these poor kids keep up with<br/>\n&gt; their French grade levels in addition to their schooling here so<br/>\n&gt; these kids were literally doing two times the work of our kids in<br/>\n&gt; school here. I felt so badly for them. :(<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; University in France was a kick! Classes began in Sept. but the<br/>\n&gt; students didn&#39;t show up until mid Oct and sometimes not until<br/>\n&gt; the New Year. Classes lasted all year. I actually enjoyed my<br/>\n&gt; classes there very much, even though they weren&#39;t that rigorous.<br/>\n&gt; I was used to UCLA which is a pretty academic school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; There is a painful apathy in French children and they are<br/>\n&gt; notoriously mischevious. It&#39;s something that we&#39;ve noticed over<br/>\n&gt; the years (we lived in Morocco too and knew French families<br/>\n&gt; there...). But the mothers are actually quite wonderful in many<br/>\n&gt; ways too. They don&#39;t believe in corporal punishment, are very<br/>\n&gt; affectionate and they lead rich artisitc lives compared to what I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; used to here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Strange mix.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All that to say that I&#39;m not at all surprised that the government<br/>\n&gt; would say school isn&#39;t meant to be fun. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Julie B <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"French homeschooling/school comment?","postDate":"1042780537","msgId":11738,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGEyLjMyMjFlNGNlLjJiNThlYjc5QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":11740,"prevInTime":11737,"nextInTime":11739,"topicId":11738,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does anyone know on which list someone talked about a discussion with French moms who said they wouldn t homeschool because it would set kids apart, make some","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2141566554\">Does anyone know on which list someone talked about a discussion with French <br/>\nmoms who said they wouldn&#39;t homeschool because it would set kids apart, make <br/>\nsome better, some such?<br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;m hoping it was here.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11739,"nextTopicId":11752}}
