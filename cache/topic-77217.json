I have one myself, called “sleepy stuff” but that had something that sped up or got loud (I forget what) so I have a sublist called “sleepier stuff” and I’ve used it for a few years, when I’m away from home, especially, and maybe have just switched time zones, and when I close my eyes and that’s playing, it’s more like being home.  So it’s possible that there are songs that would reminde him of being younger, happy, or maybe just new and peaceful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":561807031,"authorName":"","from":"staceyraeme@...","profile":"staceyraeme","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sleeping habits","postDate":"1467240751","msgId":77226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5sMWpldCsxYm1yZjVjQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM3MzA0ODIyMi4zNjEwMi4xNDY3MDc5NTYyNDgxLkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG5rbWQybisxYm5xNW81QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPENBUHYrY1l5b2lvZnBCPXNVTFVoVkROZ3MrREt2PXB2QTlNNlpVRGRNWXNDVE5TZThEZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDM3MzA0ODIyMi4zNjEwMi4xNDY3MDc5NTYyNDgxLkphdmFNYWlsLnlhaG9vQG1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77225,"nextInTopic":77228,"prevInTime":77225,"nextInTime":77227,"topicId":77217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for all the ideas.

I was feeling a bit stuck and needed to see things from some new perspectives.<br><br>A few weeks ago I did have a brief conversation with my son reminding him that staying up was a privilege and that if he couldn&#39;t be quieter then he needed to go to bed earlier. That did help a lot - I don&#39;t think he has woken us up carelessly since. He has woken us up when he wanted help getting to sleep. I don&#39;t mind that as much - I don&#39;t want him lying in bed getting stressed out about not being able to get to sleep - but it is not sustainable for my husband or I to be up in the middle of the night very often.<br><br>His staying up all night started after that conversation. Some nights when he has been quiet and not woken us, one of us gets up at 6 or 7 to see that he has not yet been asleep. My son says that he does not really want to or plan to stay up all night. He tries to turn off the computer or ipad at 2-ish to go to sleep but then feels restless and uncomfortable. When he can&#39;t get to sleep, if he doesn&#39;t come to wake us up, then he ends up turning on the ipad and watching videos and next thing he knows the sun is up and the birds are singing outside his window (that happens between 4 and 5 here nowadays) and that keeps him up too. The next day he is not up to doing much of anything until late afternoon and then he often has trouble getting to sleep the next night because he has slept in. It doesn&#39;t work great for any of us - although I am trying to see how to think about it more flexibly... When we have plans in the morning (which is rare) I do remind him and we talk about what time he needs to get to sleep. But I guess I don&#39;t follow up by helping get to sleep at that time.<br><br>My son has always had trouble getting to sleep. His dad was like this when he was a kid and I was always a night owl - staying up to read by the bit of light that came into my room from the hallway. When he was going to school and he had to get up in the morning we found various things that worked but they took a lot of energy. It was never smooth or easy. When we started letting go of bed times, I didn&#39;t feel like we went too far too fast. But I guess it is true that we stopped helping my son get to sleep kind of abruptly.&nbsp; We just drifted into him staying up later than all of us. He likes to have an hour or two alone after everyone is asleep to catch up on videos and sometimes play games, but he still seems to need support in getting to sleep most nights.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":573406999,"authorName":"Sarah Peshek","from":"Sarah Peshek

things that your daughter wants to do? &nbsp;If so, hopefully you can find someone to help make that happen, be it by picking her up and taking her where she needs to go or by hanging out at the house while your son sleeps and you take your daughter out yourself. &nbsp;Or maybe it&#39;s just more of a general antsy-ness on her part to get started on the day? &nbsp;If going out daily is important to your daughter and also works well for your son once he&#39;s up, maybe you could try to have a plan that you&#39;ll indeed go out some afternoons. &nbsp;That way your daughter knows that an activity outside the house is coming up later that day sometimes.&nbsp;</font></div><div dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ygrps-yiv-482703318yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1467060110077_3001\"><font face=\"Georgia\"

id=\"ygrps-yiv-482703318yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1467060110077_4215\">Or maybe you like mornings best yourself. &nbsp;Taking your last paragraph as a whole, it sounds like you personally do not like him staying up so late and sleeping so late. &nbsp;Maybe that schedule somehow doesn&#39;t match your own preferences and this influences your expectations of your son. &nbsp;Maybe you&nbsp;have voices from your past playing, telling you that sleeping past noon is lazy or wastes time or is somehow not socially acceptable. &nbsp;But it sounds like your son doesn&#39;t see it that way. &nbsp;He prefers what he prefers. &nbsp;To make unschooling as great as it can be, you can make choices every day to make life as in sync with everyone&#39;s preferences as possible. &nbsp;</font></div><div

Are they hanging out in the evening? Because our house is very small and my husband goes to sleep early and REALLY needs his sleep to function (and is easily disturbed), we have found that it doesn&#39;t work for the kids to stay up late because even the lights and the bathroom and their whispering disrupt his sleep. What we do instead is that he usually plays a couple of video games with the kids before he goes to bed, and then they stay up on their tablets while he is getting ready for bed and reading his book (I&#39;m usually in bed at this point, reading). They finish up one last video and then get ready for bed and come in and say goodnight and turn off the internet. Then they get into bed together and close their door and stay up reading until they are ready to sleep. It&#39;s usually pretty smooth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarah</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":124256069,"authorName":"","from":"alohabun@...","profile":"alohabun","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Sleeping habits","postDate":"1467041205","msgId":77223,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5rcmZxbyt1N2E4NG9AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDhEOTI4RUE4LUQxMkMtNDk1Qi05NkJCLTBDQ0M0OTM0OUREMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG5rbWQybisxYm5xNW81QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPDhEOTI4RUE4LUQxMkMtNDk1Qi05NkJCLTBDQ0M0OTM0OUREMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77220,"nextInTopic":77224,"prevInTime":77222,"nextInTime":77224,"topicId":77217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" & ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1813212169\"><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:Cambria;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;\">&lt;&lt;He has trouble getting to sleep on his own once everyone else is asleep&gt;&gt; &amp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:Cambria;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;\">&nbsp;&lt;&lt;He sometimes gets freaked out about being the only person awake and then comes to wake one of us up to sit in his room so that he can get to sleep.&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</span><br></div><div><br></div>If he is feeling like he needs to wake one of you to go to sleep (after you and your husband are already sleeping), is there space on your bedroom floor for a cot, mattress, blow up mattress or a pile of soft blankets?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Maybe that would meet his need to be near you when he is tired and ready to sleep without waking one of you?

I think that is because he has headphones on and is unaware of how loud he is sounding. I know he isn&#39;t doing it on purpose or that he doesn&#39;t care. However, the rest of the family still needs their sleep. Especially my husband because he needs to function well at work. Therefore, we made it clear to Li that he could only keep staying up and communicating aloud with people online if he kept his voice way down.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:Cambria;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-family:Cambria;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;\">One thing I do that helps Li is to remind him that we are going to bed and to remember to keep his voice down/quiet.

Oddly, we are nearing the end of Ramadan, and in the same situation but for different reasons, and I was just thinking we will be moving the alarm up in a few days, anticipating their desire to go swim or whatever after the holiday.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another idea is helping him to remember to be quieter or setting up space for him to softly come sleep in your room when he is tired. Your question seemed to be more oriented towards getting tired earlier, so that is why I focused on that ☺️<br><br><br></div><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <blockquote type=\"cite\"><div>\n\n\n\n</div></blockquote><style type=\"text/css\">\n<!--\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp {\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:10px 0;padding:0 10px;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp hr {\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp #ygrps-yiv-1762538569hd {\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:700;line-height:122%;margin:10px 0;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ads {\nmargin-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp .ygrps-yiv-1762538569ad {\npadding:0 0;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp .ygrps-yiv-1762538569ad p {\nmargin:0;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 #ygrps-yiv-1762538569ygrp-mkp .ygrps-yiv-1762538569ad a {\ncolor:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n-->\n</style><style>\n<!--\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 filtered {panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;}\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 filtered {panose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;}\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 filtered {font-family:Cambria;panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;}\n\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 p.ygrps-yiv-1762538569MsoNormal, #ygrps-yiv-1762538569 li.ygrps-yiv-1762538569MsoNormal, #ygrps-yiv-1762538569 div.ygrps-yiv-1762538569MsoNormal\n\t{margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Cambria;}\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 .ygrps-yiv-1762538569MsoChpDefault\n\t{font-family:Cambria;}\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 filtered {margin:72.0pt 90.0pt 72.0pt 90.0pt;}\n#ygrps-yiv-1762538569 div.ygrps-yiv-1762538569WordSection1\n\t{}\n-->\n</style></span></blockquote></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":561807031,"authorName":"","from":"staceyraeme@...","profile":"staceyraeme","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sleeping habits","postDate":"1466873758","msgId":77217,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG5rbWQybisxYm5xNW81QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77218,"prevInTime":77216,"nextInTime":77218,"topicId":77217,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am looking for perspective and ideas around my son’s sleeping habits.

My son (11) has always been a night owl and for the last\nyear or more has been staying up after everyone else goes to bed. Lately he is\noften still awake at 6/7 in the morning. He says that he is not staying up all\nnight on purpose.<span style=\"\">&nbsp; </span>He has trouble getting\nto sleep on his own once everyone else is asleep but he also says he does not want to go\nto sleep before my husband, who is the last up, goes to be at around 11:30.</span></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-914600754MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-914600754MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sometimes he wakes us up (less often than he used to). He seems to forget\nthat other people are sleeping and will be laughing loudly at youtube videos or will be walking loudly on his way to the bathroom. He sometimes gets freaked out about being the only\nperson awake and then comes to wake one of us up to sit in his room so that he\ncan get to sleep. This is a challenge for my husband and I who both really need our sleep.</span></p><p class=\"ygrps-yiv-914600754MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"ygrps-yiv-914600754MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">His staying up all night puts him out of\nsync with the rest of the family and makes it difficult if he has anything to\ndo in the morning or even early afternoon. I don’t feel that comfortable\nleaving him home alone for long stretches of time and I know he doesn’t like it\nso my daughter and I feel kind of stuck in the house while he is sleeping .\nAlso there are lots of things he likes to do with us – swimming, going for\npicnics, going out for breakfast etc. that seem harder to arrange when he is not\ngetting up until well past noon. I know lots of people in this group have had\nkids with schedules like this and I am wondering how you managed that as a family?</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-914600754yui-cursor\"></span></p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77216,"nextTopicId":77230}}
