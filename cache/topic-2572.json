As<br/>\nchance brought us more &quot;right&quot; predictions our confidence in our abilities<br/>\nwould grow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not saying that as a way of saying you&#39;re full of hooey. Just saying<br/>\nthis is why it feels right to believe it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were to collect all the &quot;psychic predictions&quot; about bin Laden (for<br/>\nexample) and then review them after he&#39;s discovered or killed or captured,<br/>\nsome of them by pure chance will be right. Most will be wrong of course. Are<br/>\nthe right ones psychic or just lucky guessers?<br/>\n<br/>\nI recall in statistics class the teacher told us of a scam where a &quot;stock<br/>\npredictor&quot; would write the same letter to a hundred people saying Stock A<br/>\nwill go up and another hundred that Stock A will go down. Depending on<br/>\nwhether Stock A goes up or down, he chooses the hundred he made the right<br/>\n&quot;prediction&quot; to and to half writes that Stock B will go up and half that<br/>\nStock B will go down. If he keeps on doing this with Stocks C, D, E and so<br/>\nforth, eventually there will be a handful of people who have proof in<br/>\nwriting that the guy is dead on accurate at predicting stocks! ;-) And then<br/>\nsend him lots of money to invest of course!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also an experiment with pigeons where the scientists would<br/>\nrandomly deliver food to pigeons who were in separate cages. After some time<br/>\npassed the scientists checked on the pigeons and they were all doing odd<br/>\nthings -- hopping on one leg, bobbing their heads, flapping their wings and<br/>\nso on. They were behaviors the pigeons just happened to be doing when food<br/>\nappeared. Food reinforced the vague idea that the behavior was associated<br/>\nwith food which made the pigeons slightly more likely to do that behavior.<br/>\nSince they would do the behavior more often, chance would coincide the<br/>\ndelivery of food with the behavior more often. Which increased the frequency<br/>\nof the behavior until the pigeons were certain the behavior was bringing the<br/>\nfood. Since the food delivery was random, the behavior didn&#39;t always bring<br/>\nfood, but it was reinforced often enough that to the pigeons there seemed to<br/>\nbe a connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1920788,"authorName":"Kathryn Orlinsky","from":"Kathryn Orlinsky &lt;kathyorlinsky@...&gt;","profile":"kjandko","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"re: Tarot and Astrology","postDate":"1011026228","msgId":2631,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDNDMwOTM0LjcwREE1MjBCQHdvcmxkbmV0LmF0dC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":2572,"nextInTopic":2815,"prevInTime":2630,"nextInTime":2632,"topicId":2572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you didn&#39;t mention Astrology, but mentioned Tarot so I just wanted to<br/>\nmake it clear that Astrology is a Science.  Astronomy and Astrology were one<br/>\nand the same up until the Age of Enlightenment.  Astrology is also<br/>\nMathematical.  Astrology has been documented 5000 BC and was mentioned<br/>\nprofusely in the original books now known as the Bible...  Of course this is<br/>\na very different metaphysical discipline than Tarot.  As a Professional<br/>\nCertified Tarot Instructor it would be very unprofessional to tell people<br/>\nthey&#39;ve been with people in another life, or to imply something is likely to<br/>\nhappen in the future.  I think those are called Fortune Tellers and are<br/>\nillegal in many states.  The job of a Professional Tarot Reader is to<br/>\nfeedback to you hidden matters that the individual needs to work on within<br/>\nthemselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for evidence it&#39;s only the scientific community that doesn&#39;t recognize<br/>\nthe 6th sense as scientific.  I think it&#39;s more about fear.  I can only<br/>\nspeak for myself but I have on tape in November of last year talking about<br/>\nGeorge Bush and Al Gore and how George Bush would be the better candidate<br/>\nfor WHEN we went to war.  One of the guys on the radio said &quot;don&#39;t you mean<br/>\nIF we went to war&quot; and I said &quot;sorry for some reason WHEN seemed to fit the<br/>\nbill more than IF&quot;..... I also said, again on tape prior to the event &quot;Al<br/>\nGore for some reason will have a hard time leaving the White House, but I<br/>\ncan&#39;t figure out why&quot;.... Well now we know why....<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen JFK Jr&#39;s airplane went down, the week before, again on tape we were<br/>\ntalking about the Kennedy&#39;s on the radio.  I said &quot;that John Jr needed to be<br/>\ncareful flying his airplane especially because of where Mars and Pluto were<br/>\ntransiting in his chart&quot;.... I forgot about it until I turn on the<br/>\ntelevision on a Saturday morning which staying at a hotel with hubby only to<br/>\nsee all this news coverage of his downed airplane.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what kind of evidence should there be and was that just lucky guesswork<br/>\non my part?  I don&#39;t think so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a family of psychics and Tarot Readers so for me I find it<br/>\nreally strange that everyone doesn&#39;t read cards.  It must be really unusual<br/>\nnot to have Tarot Cards around and for conversations in the family to center<br/>\naround the 6th sense and what we are learning with that part of the brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n********************<br/>\nDawn  Falbe<br/>\nAstrologer Coach<br/>\n(520) 312-5300<br/>\n********************<br/>\nwww.astrologerdawn.com<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:dawn@...\">dawn@...</a><br/>\nEnlightening you on how to discover and live your Soul Purpose<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The people who get on in this world are people who get up and look for the<br/>\ncircumstances they want, and, if they can&#39;t find them, make them.&quot; - George<br/>\nBernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;The only time my education was interrupted was when I was in school&quot; -<br/>\nGeorge Bernard Shaw<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2794,"nextTopicId":2637}}
