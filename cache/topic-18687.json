But my whole, strange and embarassingly public transformation is indeed available today. I&#39;ve even saved my own posts and can post them for anyone that doesn&#39;t believe Kelly. lol<br/>\nThe sad thing is, I really, really loved John Holt and his views back when I first started researching homeschooling...back in 1995. I just couldn&#39;t GET IT why my ds didn&#39;t act interested in the cool stuff those kids in the book did. So I pushed.<br/>\nAnd pushed, and then a little less, and less and pretty soon we were very eclectic/relaxed and already considered fringe by all the other homeschoolers around us.<br/>\nTHEN, I went totally unschooling...as far as education goes. But it took me a bit longer to get how it relates to ALL our lives, including tv and food and chores and....well, y&#39;all know.:)<br/>\nI&#39;m the poster child for transformation in public.<br/>\nBecause I&#39;m loudly opinionated, but I am willing to change. So it&#39;s all out there for you folks to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.&quot;<br/>\nAlbert Einstein</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18678,"nextTopicId":18688}}
