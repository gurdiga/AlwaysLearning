I think it more<br/>\nlikely that this difference has to do with hunting.   <br/>\nTraditionally, men are built for hunting, and for<br/>\nphysically protecting mate and young.  In order to<br/>\nfacilitate these adreneline fed activities, men are<br/>\ngiven the ability to hyper-focus on them, and tune out<br/>\nunrelated surrounding distraction.  Men also have more<br/>\ncones than rods in their eyes, cones being what allows<br/>\nclose focusing.  (Hope I got that right, cones vs<br/>\nrods, the principle is correct, men have more focusing<br/>\nability, but I forget which is which cones/rods.)  Men<br/>\nhad no great need for communicating subtleties either,<br/>\nbut used direct, brief, needs driven communication. <br/>\n<br/>\nWomen are designed to pick up more sensory information<br/>\nand subtle clues in order to be aware of the needs of<br/>\nher children around her, and aware of the dangers in<br/>\nher environment, and discovering sustenance and<br/>\nmeeting other basic needs by gathering plantstuffs,<br/>\nall at the same time.  Women have more rods than cones<br/>\nin their eyes, allowing them more peripheral vision<br/>\nand wider and more varied perception.  Women were in<br/>\ncharge of the home and family and needed greater<br/>\nsocial awareness and sensability to deal with those<br/>\naround her, and a more complex communication system<br/>\nfor dealing with the issues of being social,<br/>\ninterrelating and interdependent in a child rearing<br/>\nsituation with others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTimes have changed and sex roles are not so clear cut<br/>\nanymore.  But women are indeed better built for doing<br/>\ncertain things more easily than men, and the reverse<br/>\nis also true.  Which only means some things are more<br/>\nchallenging for one that seem simple to the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
