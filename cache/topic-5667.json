I use it because I&#39;m emphasizing that we&#39;re &quot;inviting&quot; <br/>\nthe kids to do something or share something with us, rather than insisting <br/>\nthat it is time to sit down and do their math or science or whatever. <br/>\nSometimes it really is just an offhand &quot;offer&quot; - &quot;Hey, do you feel like going <br/>\nto the science museum today?&quot; Or, &quot;Look at this coloring book of underwater <br/>\ncreatures, is this something you want?&quot; Other times it is slightly stronger, <br/>\n&quot;Hey, I thought we&#39;d go to the science musuem today.&quot; (See - I&#39;m not exactly <br/>\nasking, but the kids can object - &quot;NO NONO we already had plans to build a <br/>\nlego castle today.&quot;) Sometimes we make plans in advance. I say, &quot;Hey guys, I <br/>\nreally want to go up to the Norton Simon Museum one of these days and so we <br/>\nput that on the calendar. Again, if a kid really didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d work <br/>\nout an alternative for them - staying with a friend or something. But when <br/>\nthey were young they usually wanted to go - we always had fun no matter where <br/>\nwe went and it wasn&#39;t like I tortured them, making them stay longer than it <br/>\nwas fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also used the &quot;Leave it laying around&quot; method a lot -- if I found something <br/>\nI thought was cool for the kids, I&#39;d just get it and leave it out. Sometimes <br/>\nit would get buried in the piles of stuff and reemerge months or years later <br/>\njust at the right moment (there&#39;s that serendipity again) for some child to <br/>\nbe interested.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 279","postDate":"1016719897","msgId":5667,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjI0MmIzOWJlLjI5Y2I0NDE5QGNzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5692,"prevInTime":5666,"nextInTime":5668,"topicId":5667,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pat, Pam s response was so thorough.
