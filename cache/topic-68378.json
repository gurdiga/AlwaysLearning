It didn&#39;t bother him<br/>\nuntil he was 7. That was when he first became frustrated by people not<br/>\nunderstanding him. At that point, I asked him if he would want to go to<br/>\nspeech therapy so that he could learn how to speak so that others would<br/>\nunderstand. He wanted it, so we did it. We didn&#39;t take him before that,<br/>\nbecause he never seemed bothered by it and we had been told that he would<br/>\neventually outgrow it.  It may have been beneficial to do it earlier, but<br/>\nI&#39;m glad we waited until he wanted it. The only problem is that his younger<br/>\nsisters now speak with some of his former speech patterns because they<br/>\nlearned so much from hearing him!<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"5 year old frustrated that others can&#39;t understand his speech","postDate":"1343392825","msgId":68378,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1dTI3cCs3Y2I4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":68392,"prevInTime":68377,"nextInTime":68379,"topicId":68378,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"As the subject says, my 5 year old doesn t have very clear speech yet.

I&#39;m not concerned about it but I&#39;ve noticed him getting more and more frustrated by it. More and more often I hear him tell people to just nevermind when they ask him to repeat himself. I can usually understand him pretty well but I&#39;m around him all the time and I make an effort to listen and understand. The only other person who can really understand him most of the time is his 8 year old brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can&#39;t pronounce consonants in the back of the throat like K and G. He makes T and D sounds for those. I have asked him if he can make those sounds and he says he cannot. He still uses &quot;Me&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;, as in, &quot;Me like that.&quot; He says &quot;wuse&quot; instead of &quot;use&quot;. He tends to speak very softly and quickly so that his words run together. I&#39;ve been asking him to speak more loudly and slowly. He sometimes gets angry when I do that but, otherwise, I sometimes can&#39;t understand him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have any ideas of what I could do to help with his frustration? <br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68452,"nextTopicId":68477}}
