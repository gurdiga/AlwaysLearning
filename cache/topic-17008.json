If <br/>\nit were to someone else for some serious purpose, I might&#39;ve suggested a few <br/>\ntweaks, but it served its purpose pretty well, and gave all the good <br/>\ninformation.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSince I&#39;ve never had my kids tested, it&#39;s fun sometimes when I get the gift <br/>\nof evidence. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGlen is his boss, and Kirby&#39;s friend Eric is with him; Eric&#39;s bicycle is here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent to the store to play in the Magic state Championship tourney… I&#39;m sorry <br/>\nif this messes up anything. As for shopping wise if there isn&#39;t another good <br/>\ntime I&#39;ll just go on my own and try to get it to work out…<br/>\n<br/>\nIt starts at 9 AM and I plan on taking the Van. Glenn&#39;s Cell phone number is <br/>\n720-8249 if you need to get a hold of me. And if you need the Van I could <br/>\nbring it back in the after a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is something that only happens once a year and I think I might do well.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17056,"nextTopicId":17045}}
