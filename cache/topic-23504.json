I should have been more clear. Many years ago I went to a workshop for homeschoolers on learning styles and I didn&#39;t think much of it. I read the discriptions of the styles and couldn&#39;t really find myself or my children at all. However I do think that each person learns more easily in some ways rather than others.  <br/>\n  My first kid learns very easily, she pretty much grasps whatever she is exposed to the first time it comes by. It can be something she reads about, hears, experiences physically or whatever, she remembers and understand it. This seems to be the case even if she isn&#39;t very interested in the material. My second girl is similar, but if she isn&#39;t interested, forget it. Unless she reads it, if she reads something she remembers it.<br/>\n  My youndest is visually impared and we have to get more creative in helping her satisfy her curiosity.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My point was just that each family and child have their own approach(es) to family life and learning. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sharon<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt; -=-We also don&#39;t know what the learning styles of these children <br/>\n&gt; might be. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>&quot;Learning styles&quot; was a really exciting thing for teachers to think <br/>\nabout 20 years ago.

These days, if someone asks me about what we do I share with them<br/>\nexamples of what our lives are like.  I don&#39;t get philosophical or into<br/>\ndetails of unschooling unless I&#39;m talking with other unschoolers.  I just<br/>\nshare what our lives are like and how excited we are about it and how much<br/>\nfun we have with it.  Most of my friends (whose kids are all in school)<br/>\ncan&#39;t imagine being able to do what I do... and visa versa!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara<br/>\n<br/>\nMahalo - May you be in Divine Breath</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152350410,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"&quot;Robyn Coburn&quot; &lt;dezigna@...&gt;","profile":"designarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] OP question","postDate":"1134332787","msgId":23509,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"inReplyToHeader":"PGRuZzUzbSt0M3N2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":23504,"nextInTopic":23512,"prevInTime":23508,"nextInTime":23510,"topicId":23504,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1173964316\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Family number 1:  they have 10 kids and insist that they unschool <br/>\nthe kids.

My experience in<br/>\nmyself of having these kinds of thoughts is that it ends up causing *me* a<br/>\nlot of emotional anguish, distracts me from Jayn and my own family, and<br/>\naffects the other families not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou just can&#39;t take responsibility for other people&#39;s children or control<br/>\nhow other people are going to take any information they receive. Even the<br/>\n&quot;no textbooks&quot; portion is a positive step, rather than something to be<br/>\nfeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is partly why I don&#39;t do school conversations. Self protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect, and I could be wrong, but still, I suspect that your best path is<br/>\nto stop focusing at all, in any way, on what these other families are doing,<br/>\nand what they are labeling their home schooling, and turn all of your<br/>\nattention to enriching your own children&#39;s lives - without making<br/>\ncomparisons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can be a shining light of contentment and joy and relaxed engagement<br/>\nwith your children, you will likely then attract the interest of other<br/>\nmothers who genuinely want to receive the information about Unschooling<br/>\nwithout becoming hostile. They start to want what you have and ask you how<br/>\nyou got there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that it is hard not to be evangelical about Unschooling - but no<br/>\nmessage, regardless of how compelling and simple and joyful it is, will be<br/>\nheard by those with closed ears. <br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Truth be told they are radical <br/>\nreligious people and do try to control the kids life and thinking <br/>\nbut are to busy with other stuff to do anything but say &quot;No&quot; to them <br/>\nand limit their interaction with just about anything.  <br/>\n   And then their is family number2: Who&#39;s Mother always  asks me <br/>\nabout what kind of homeschooling I do with my kids and I am afraid <br/>\nto talk about unschooling to her for fear that I know what a limited <br/>\nlife she lives and I think she might take the &quot;no school time and no <br/>\ntext book&quot; part and forget or gloss over the &quot;get out and experiance <br/>\nlife part&quot;.
