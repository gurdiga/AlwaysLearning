They advertise in homeschool newsletters, in <br/>\nchildrens book stores, and just about anywhere else homeschoolers can <br/>\nbe found.  They sound very appealing to new homeschooler.  When I was <br/>\nnew they sounded very tempting.  My daughter wanted to take a couple <br/>\nof classes so we looked into it.  The *principle* was very charming <br/>\nand happy to show me around the grounds and to show me all the happy <br/>\nchildren.  Then he said I would need an intend to homeschool form <br/>\nfilled out and left with him, not the district but him.  I would have <br/>\nto volunter 10 hours a month, but that I would have imput on the <br/>\ncurriculum for my daughter, because they are so concerened for her <br/>\npersonally....When I asked would I still be considered a homeschooler <br/>\nhe was quick to assure me that *Oh yes you will still have your  <br/>\nhomeschooling statues*....But if I want to take my daughter out for a <br/>\nweek because we have a trip planned that is ok....right?...*Well ummm <br/>\nthose things can be worked out in advance usually it is not a <br/>\nproblem*....So you are telling me I have to file a intend form with <br/>\nyou, I have to volunter, we can not come and go as we please, and my <br/>\ndaughter will be required to follow some curriculum that you an 300 <br/>\nother parents have decided on??....But I am still a <br/>\nHOMESCHOOLER? ....What?...No thank you...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what happened here, to me. And is still going on for <br/>\nmany.  In fact there was, just this school year, a big flap because <br/>\nsomehow the school district got a hold of a Homeschool Assoc. mailing <br/>\nlist and sent pamphets to everyone on the list.  It was assumed by <br/>\nthe Assoc. that someone from the district came in and paid dues and <br/>\ngot the list.  I know it is different in other states.  But for <br/>\nWashington that is what AEP are about.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere the AEP are programs by the district to entice new homeschooler <br/>\nand suck them back into the system were they (the district) have the <br/>\ncontrol. And then to tell the bold face lie that you are still a <br/>\nhomeschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nCally</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3064,"nextTopicId":3079}}
