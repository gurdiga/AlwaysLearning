My 7.5yr old","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1541044109\">Hello all - first posting<br/>\nHave been researching home education for 6/8 months now and still<br/>\nundecided/confident enough to make the leap...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 7.5yr old wonderful son is in primary 2 at our local village school and<br/>\npretty happy.  Before enrolling him I had no idea that we had the choice of<br/>\nwhether or not to send him - we probably wouldn&#39;t have.  As it was we<br/>\ndeferred his starting school (his birthday is end of January so we enrolled<br/>\nhim at 5.7yrs) and at the time I found this decision hard - with more<br/>\nknowledge I would very much prefer our kids to start school (if doing so)<br/>\naged 7 or 8. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am very torn between wanting him to continue as a confident,<br/>\nsensitive, happy person and my increasing worry that the whole &#39;schooling&#39;<br/>\nprocess could turn him into a more insecure, hesitant person whose life is<br/>\ndirected by pleasing others!<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel closer to him, more connected, when we have spent the entire day<br/>\ntogether.  When we walk home from school, I hate the fact that I have to<br/>\nquestion what he did and who he spent time with.  There are many of the<br/>\nteaching practices that I strongly disagree with and can totally understand<br/>\nwhy and how they would stunt enthusiasm and curb curiosity.  We  have a 2<br/>\nyear old daughter (the age gap was deliberate - we wanted our second child<br/>\nto have the same one-to-one time that Cal obviously benefited from) and I<br/>\nwonder about the balance of the pros and cons when dealing with the<br/>\npracticalities of this age range.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s in a class of 20 and I know most of the children.  The teachers aren&#39;t<br/>\nfantastic but they&#39;re not terrible either.  He&#39;s very popular and bright but<br/>\nhe also says he misses me and still obviously needs the hugs and kisses and<br/>\nquiet time of home.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, I flux between &quot;letting it lie&quot; and &quot;we should all be<br/>\ntogether&quot;.  A year ago I wouldn&#39;t be agonising over this, he would be part<br/>\nof the crowd and fitting in fine  - is ignorance bliss?<br/>\n  <br/>\nAlso -  how much of our own life experience injuries do we inflict on our<br/>\nchildren?  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny guidance welcomed.<br/>\nJan<br/>\n<br/>\nPs we live in Scotland where the home-schooling concept has yet to blossom.<br/>\n_______________<br/>\nJan Clark<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jan@...\">jan@...</a><br/>\nDunallan<br/>\nKippen FK8 3JB<br/>\n01786 870 210</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22554,"nextTopicId":22557}}
