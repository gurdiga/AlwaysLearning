I have more books I want  to read, want to <br/>\nwatch movies I choose, want to eat when and what I feel  like eating, <br/>\nand so on. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***You are so right Pam.  A few years ago I went to a dance weekend by  <br/>\nmyself and was camping.  I was at a complete loss to know how much food to  take.  <br/>\nHow much food to I eat??  Do I need to use the bathroom?? It  was so strange <br/>\nto scale down, and be self-focused.  For years I didn&#39;t let  myself have <br/>\nfiction in the house for me.  I wasn&#39;t an attentive mom with my  nose in the book, <br/>\nand I couldn&#39;t seem to read just a little!!  In these  last few years I have <br/>\nmade up for that.  A time, and a season----<br/>\n <br/>\nConnie<br/>\n_www.homeschoolingreflections.com_ (http://www.homeschoolingreflections.com) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21998,"nextTopicId":22007}}
