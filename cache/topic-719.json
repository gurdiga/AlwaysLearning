My oldest is almost 10...I think we&#39;ve got the door<br/>\nopen.  She has a few older friends which has brought some sexuality issues<br/>\nto the surface.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I hope for my children is that they will be responsible, loving, caring<br/>\npeople in their relationships.  As they mature and develop into adulthood,<br/>\nI hope their intimate friendships are based on love, honor and respect for<br/>\neach other.<br/>\nS</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":717,"nextTopicId":722}}
