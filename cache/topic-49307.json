That they all unschool is not <br/>\nenough, by itself, to create a group of friends, as they get into teen <br/>\nyears. Yes, my kids DO really tend to like other unschoolers a lot. They <br/>\nDO find that there are ways they &quot;get&quot; each other that kids who were <br/>\nschooled just don&#39;t get. It IS nice to know other unschooled teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m not discouraging you from getting your girls together with other <br/>\nunschoolers, but your idea of starting an email list and getting <br/>\ntogether once a month is too vague.
