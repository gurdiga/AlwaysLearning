This is a similar situation to the Fox News lawsuit where they claimed sole right to &quot;fair and balanced&quot; because they registered the trademark; the judge laughed them out of court.  Registering a trademark does not automatically make it valid.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  A quick Google search found multiple books and articles prior to her trademark and book that use the terms peaceful parenting.  You cannot have a valid trademark on common language.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Based on my quick review, I do not think she could possibly win a trademark infringement action.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Also, first in time does not automatically win the deal.  I live near the semi-famous music school Interlochen.  A camp out east sued them because it had been using the name Interlochen for almost 50-years longer.  The courts ruled for the music school, because the public generally associated the name Interlochen with the music school, not the camp that used the name first.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  With all that said, if you do not want a potential hassle change the title.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  -John Rizzo<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nAhhh...imagining that irresistible &quot;new car&quot; smell?<br/>\n Check outnew cars at Yahoo!

No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright. (See following note.) There are, however, certain definite advantages to registration. See &quot;Copyright Registration.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nCopyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is &quot;created&quot; when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time. &quot;Copies&quot; are material objects from which a work can be read or visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm. &quot;Phonorecords&quot; are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or LPs. Thus, for example, a song (the &quot;work&quot;) can be fixed in sheet music (&quot;copies&quot;) or in phonograph disks (&quot;phonorecords&quot;), or both. If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhth!!<br/>\n<br/>\nemmy<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.cafepress.com/emmytofa<br/>\nwww.emmytofa.com<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: Sandra Dodd <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Sunday, April 15, 2007 3:25 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] general question<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Philosophically or legally, anyone have an opinion on this?<br/>\n  I&#39;m not recommending people go look at the site.

Yes, she could do that. There was supposed  <br/>\nto be a search to make sure that the phrase was not already being  <br/>\nutilized by someone else - that could include unregistered trademark  <br/>\nuse. In other words, just because you hadn&#39;t actually registered the  <br/>\ntrademark, if you were using it, it could be considered that you had  <br/>\nan unregistered trademark and that could have prevented her from  <br/>\nregistering it. But, they didn&#39;t find that in the search so they let  <br/>\nher register it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not finding an &quot;article&quot; with that title, but you have a nice  <br/>\npage on your site with that title and we&#39;ve listed that as one of  <br/>\nyour talks to be given at the HSC conference.
