It  <br/>\nmust be tiresome for the experienced unschoolers to have to respond to some  <br/>\nqueries, especially when the motivation behind the query is in  doubt.  But I <br/>\nhave to say this particular exchange WAS really  illuminating (Schuyler, I <br/>\nlove hearing you talk anthropology!).  <br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve felt this way before when there&#39;s been an element of controversy on  <br/>\nthe list: sometimes, in these cases, the clarifications and statements  <br/>\ncoming from the experienced unschoolers are absolutely crystallized and really  <br/>\nhelpful.<br/>\n <br/>\nCould a compromise be reached in this case, ie could posts be accepted  so <br/>\nlong as the signature line promoting the mainstream parenting website is  <br/>\nremoved?  (Though I can understand why Sandra  might not want the  hassle of <br/>\npolicing this on top of all the other activities she gets through in a  day).<br/>\n <br/>\nJude x<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4442,"nextTopicId":55193}}
