He didn&#39;t listen to me and fell off onto a rock<br/>\n and split his head and had to go to the emergency room.

Do <br/>\n you tell the parent their child should pay half to get it fixed or <br/>\n get a new one?<br/>\n My opinion is that when we have friends over, I take on the <br/>\n responsibility of the kids and try very hard to make sure things <br/>\n don&#39;t get out of hand and people or things don&#39;t get hurt.  If <br/>\n something does accidentally get broken...bummer.  <br/>\n My example for my thinking, is when we had a party, and my aunt <br/>\n spilled red wine on my carpet, I, in no way, would have asked her to <br/>\n foot the cleaning bill.  It&#39;s the price of a party sometimes.  <br/>\n Having kids in your house, sometimes things get broken.<br/>\n I am now uncomfortable letting my child go to this house because <br/>\n there is always something that happens and I&#39;m told about it and made <br/>\n to feel like he should pay.   <br/>\n We don&#39;t have this problem at other friends houses.<br/>\n He really likes this friend though.

If you are concerned that stuff is going on that makes you uncomfortable or are worried about your child&#39;s comfort or safety, then trust your instincts. You also don&#39;t want your child to be accused of things that they didn&#39;t really do. Could you go over with your daughter to supervise and check things out? Or have the friend go over to your house? <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; by Gavin de Becker <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gavindebecker.com/books-ptg.cfm\">https://www.gavindebecker.com/books-ptg.cfm</a> is a bit paranoid but very informative. <br/>\n<br/>\nI babysat when I was a teen and the parents would drive me home. My mom knew that one set of parents were big social drinkers. I loved babysitting the kids but she thought it might be a problem. Sure enough, the parents came home obviously drunk a few times. We had worked out that I would say that my mom was out, and could pick me up on her way home. It was pretty funny because I would call home and asked for my mom, wait a few minutes and then say that she should leave her friend&#39;s to come get me. One time she came with her fur coat over her nightgown. <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend wouldn&#39;t let her daughter stay over at a relative&#39;s house, because she had a bad feeling and sure enough, the father was later accused of molesting a child.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if it is a concern about paying for broken things, that you could work out as adults. But if you are worried about supervision, or things getting out of hand, or an unreasonable adult who can&#39;t problem solve, then trust your instincts and do what you need to do to keep your child safe.<br/>\n<br/>\nJae<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When friends are over","postDate":"1216760836","msgId":36779,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdCOTU5OTZCLTQ4ODgtNDc2MS1BM0M1LTIwOTg1OTFFRkI4M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc2NTliaitlZ2pmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc2NTliaitlZ2pmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36778,"nextInTopic":36780,"prevInTime":36778,"nextInTime":36780,"topicId":36771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I like the you don t bill me/I won t bill you idea.-=- The problem with that is if her kids are used to having to pay for things or see other people be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1957621455\">-=-I like the &quot;you don&#39;t bill me/I won&#39;t bill you&quot; idea.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with that is if her kids are used to having to pay for  <br/>\nthings or see other people be made to pay for things and they find  <br/>\nout there&#39;s an &quot;I won&#39;t bill you&quot; deal, they might be tempted to  <br/>\nbreak something really expensive &quot;because they can.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When friends are over","postDate":"1216758126","msgId":36778,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3OTI0MS40MDEyNi5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36777,"nextInTopic":36779,"prevInTime":36777,"nextInTime":36779,"topicId":36771,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Something similar has happened with my son at his friends house, MD just turned 6 and his friends are 6 almost 7 and almost 9.

She <br/>\nhas 2 boys.  At my house they had to learn that jumping on the <br/>\nfurniture was not okay, running and screaming through the house-not <br/>\nokay,  hurting the younger brother-not okay, rough housing was done <br/>\noutside (and once they got out there, they would run around but not <br/>\ntackle like they wanted to on the couch, cause it hurts to land on <br/>\npinecones and hard ground.)  I keep them always in ear shot, and when <br/>\nI hear things getting out of control, I step in.  And that does <br/>\nhappen often.   We see them on the beach quite a bit and my mother <br/>\nand sister get annoyed when they are there because the kids are too <br/>\nloud and active for their comfort and they see Jack amping up around <br/>\nthem.  Not that it&#39;s not mutual.  He really likes to wrestle and <br/>\nchase and act crazy.   It&#39;s mostly fine on the beach.  I&#39;m just <br/>\nthinking that this craziness is going on in her house, and who is <br/>\nreally responsible then?<br/>\nA big toy water squirter broke while Jack was playing with it.  We <br/>\nreplaced it with a super soaker, and found out the older boys, who <br/>\nhad the same kind of squirter, also broke after we left that day.  <br/>\nShe could have mentioned that, because she pretty much told me where <br/>\nI could get another one to replace it.  Yesterday, when I picked Jack<br/>\nup, I get to hear about how the older boys DS fell out of his hand <br/>\nand a piece broke off, when he and Jack were getting too crazy.   The <br/>\nstory from both boys was that Jack was blowing a little whistle and <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t stop when asked by his friend.  The friend then kicked him 3 <br/>\ntimes because he was so annoyed, Jack pushed him and the DS fell.  <br/>\nShe felt they were both responsible and Jack should pay half $30 to <br/>\nget it fixed.  (though the DS still works).  She didn&#39;t see any of <br/>\nthis happen.  The reason she knows how much it costs to get fixed is <br/>\nbecause her younger son broke his a couple of weeks ago because he <br/>\nthrew it at his older brother.  The older brother had been annoying <br/>\nhim.  She felt they were both to blame and made the older one chip in <br/>\n$20 to get it fixed. That would not have been how I would have <br/>\nhandled that.  <br/>\nWe obviously have different ideas about acceptable behavior and how <br/>\nto handle friends coming over and consequences.<br/>\nI was really upset when I left there yesterday.  I told Jack as soon <br/>\nas we walked out &quot;your not going over there any more&quot;.  He got sad.  <br/>\nI said they could come to our house and also play on the beach <br/>\ntogether still.  He seemed to understand my frustration and accepted <br/>\nthat.<br/>\nI needed to vent, because I hate confrontation and I have a knot in <br/>\nmy stomach about all this.<br/>\nI also needed/need some perspective.<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna W.
