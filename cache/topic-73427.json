I read TONS of books (by Steiner and by his followers), ran a discussion group from my house AND a biodynamic discussion group when we had our biodynamic farm. I had the perfect little Waldorf homestead and my house looked like a Waldorf kindergarden. I made all my needle-felted props (with homemade plant-dyed wool!!) to tell stories to my girls (Waldorf-approved stories, of course!!) and had a very strong daily, weekly and yearly rhythm... Sooooo, I know where you are coming from. But you know what? I kept going to bed (memorizing my stories... and talking to the girls angels, of course!) and wondering: when will we have fun together? When will it get easier? What&#39;s the point of all this if I feel like going through the day is just a reproduction of a script?<br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">I was on Waldorf forums and kept asking about my girls not wanting to participate in circle time, not wanting to go outside when it was &quot;time&quot;, etc. and all I got was: reign those little girls back in! And it did not felt right... Finally, I came accross Sandra&#39;s Website and Big Book and Rue Kream&#39;s book and others and it all made sense. I remember reading those books on a camping trip with my girls and it was a revelation. Everything changed. And we started having fun! It felt so right...</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Of course, I didn&#39;t drop everything all at once. It was a slow transition (fortunately, my girls were still quite young, so we were still in the early childhood phase), but a sure one to more authenticity and more joy. That being said, it is a long process to let go of those Waldorf-induced fears. The only cure is to watch your child, watch movies with them (and if you do not care for the movie, watch them watch the movie and how their little faces light up!). Forget Steiner and his funky ideas, look at your children. They are your inspiration, not Steiner. Trust that their joy is much more important than some quirky ideas about how to raise children from 100 years ago. Steiner was an interesting man, but he lived a long time ago and we need to be here and now, WITH your children.</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Need to go and fix lunch!</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Love,</p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">Catherine Forest<br></p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] RE: How to tell when screens are being used to escape","postDate":"1391786819","msgId":73466,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlGQ0ZFMzE4LUIxRTYtNEM4NS04RjA1LUJDMTU2MkM0MEE3RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxkMWpxNCs2ZXUwZnZAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGZpd2J2Z25xeW90bGNmM242dWdlNmJseS4xMzkxNzAwMTI5NTM0QGVtYWlsLmFuZHJvaWQuY29tPiA8QTkxMDcxNjEtMzQ3NS00NzJBLTg4N0QtRTREOUQ0QjYxQkI1QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8bGQxanE0KzZldTBmdkBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73465,"nextInTopic":73468,"prevInTime":73465,"nextInTime":73467,"topicId":73427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-he gets disappointed and wonders why I am reading all this stuff and just pretending to do it!

But that&#39;s not the way unschooling kids learn. They actively compare shows, movies, games, stories, and things other people say to them. They bounce ideas off other ideas and see where that gets them. They wonder why the same story has multiple versions - and why very different stories can have the same underlying themes, plots, even characters.&nbsp;<br><br>If &nbsp;your daughter likes Barbie movies, here&#39;s something for you to play with in your own mind- how is the Barbie Rapunzel story like Tangled? How are they different? Which is more &quot;true&quot; to the original tale? Which do you like better? Which is more &quot;feminist&quot;? Like an old compare-contrast school exercise ;) Or if not Rapunzel, pick some other show or movie or game your daughter likes and think about it in terms of some classic piece of literature or folk lore.

I do have a really hard time with this. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You *should* be worried if your daughter gets transfixed by something!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can&#39;t relax until you can see what&#39;s *really* happening that you&#39;re *labeling* transfixed. Until then you&#39;re just trying to stuff your fears down. That&#39;s not good! The fears will fester and pop back up unexpectedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;s engaged. She&#39;s found games and other things that seem to her to understand what she&#39;s curious about. They&#39;re answering her questions. They&#39;re showing her new things she&#39;s likely to be curious about and she is curious about some of them. And she then has the freedom to explore them.<br/>\n<br/>\nGames are incredibly empowering! Kids get to control what they pursue. And they are given the power to pursue it. The younger you are the more road blocks that real life puts in your path to pursuing interests. Real life makes young kids dependent on adults who may not have the patience or time to support a child investigating their curiosities. Real life sets up roadblocks of time, money, distance and all sorts of other things. With games it&#39;s all right there in reach of a finger. If you make a mistake, no adult will make you feel embarrassed or point it out. Games provide *real* feedback that something didn&#39;t work. So you get to try again. And again. You can even *deliberately* choose wrong to see what will happen and learn more about how the world (or the rules) work.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want to grab all that power and freedom away from her. So she can do what? Play with physical toys that make *you* feel better?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Our 2 year old daughter sits transfixed<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If she were transfixed, that means all our kids are (or were) also transfixed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does that mean? Did we not care that our kids were transfixed? And now that some of our kids are older, do we not see or care about the damage it caused to our kids? Are we so in love with a philosophy that we&#39;d recommend other parents damage their kids too?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is more likely? That your daughter is transfixed? Or that you&#39;re mislabeling what you&#39;re seeing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; All my Waldorf reading indicates they will contract some terrible disease at <br/>\n&gt; 35 if they are &quot;awakened&quot; too early from early academics or watching media.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Television has been around (in significant numbers) since the 1950s. Computers since the end of the 70&#39;s. Why is it that only these Waldorf people -- as opposed to the legions of scientists who would be naturally curious about such connections -- have noticed these diseases and how they connect to technology?<br/>\n<br/>\nWaldorf writers are playing on the natural instinct of mothers to want to protect their children from scary things. And what do they get? They get people to buy their books and send their kids to their schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe Waldorf people believe what they&#39;re saying. I believe they do want to protect people from what they believe are horrible things. The thing is that once someone accepts that their fears might be real, they start filtering the world through that fear. They pull in all the ideas that support their fears which bolsters their confidence that they&#39;re right to fear. And they dismiss anything that would cause them to question their fears. The fear becomes like a big comfortable wall between you and what will harm your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* you want to support your children rather than your fears, those fears need to be dragged out in the light to be examined. (As you say you are :-)) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If you were living alone, technology would definitely not have to be part of *your* life. You could make that choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you have a family and your choices impact them. You&#39;re deciding that *they* shouldn&#39;t have TV just because you don&#39;t want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to unschool, then you&#39;ll need to find a way to live your values in such a way that others can peacefully pursue what they values. Vegetarian and organic loving unschooling parents *can* find ways to eat and prepare what they believe is best while supporting their kids exploring the world of food.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith TV fears, it&#39;s often much easier for a parent to drag her dislike out into the light to examine it. It&#39;s much harder to create an environment where everyone can watch what they want in peace and feel supported while you avoid it! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo *is* it just the Waldorf message that began your fears? Or did Waldorf feed fears that were already there? Can you trace the roots of your fears back? Does it go deeper than technology? Is there something you fear not having control of because of something bad in your past?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":270927662,"authorName":"janine davies","from":"janine davies &lt;daviesj69@...&gt;","profile":"kessykoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] RE: How to tell when screens are being used to escape","postDate":"1391587027","msgId":73454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjEyNC1XNDZDM0M0MTgzQzcyQjY2NTIxQjRBNEE2OTUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGxjcnRydCtlMGU4c25AWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGxjbm82ayt0N212Z0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+LDw1RUU3NTg1NS0yRENFLTQ3QzktQTIyQS1CN0QzNTFEMzM2M0ZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+LDxsY3J0cnQrZTBlOHNuQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73453,"nextInTopic":73455,"prevInTime":73453,"nextInTime":73455,"topicId":73427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My eldest son did a year of alternative steiner like school, then a year at a recognised steiner school, and before that 2 yrs mainstream.

It is very big to her especially since we got wifi hooked up in our house on weekend.\nIt helps to put self into child&#39;s shoes with husband example. Offers that insight where you are indeed a partner not a dictator.\nI would love to come to terms with technology. I am quite old fashioned in this way.\nMy husband gets this so much better than me. We have been trying to tear apart my fears and biases and strongly uncomfortable feelings around children looking at ipod or computer or TV. .. I am looking at the clock and wondering if she will ever play with her toys again. I am worried about our 2 and 4 year Olds and their sudden increase in exposure to these technological devices. Our 2 year old daughter sits transfixed when something is on. I do have a really hard time with this.  All my Waldorf reading indicates they will contract some terrible disease at 35 if they are &quot;awakened&quot; too early from early academics or watching media. It&#39;s scary stuff and after reading Waldorf materials for the past three years I am now basically saying everything Mr Steiner said was rubbish! Oh it&#39;s very confusing.\nMy husband says if I can just come to peace with this part of life (which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... Plenty of people don&#39;t have televisions) I will be able to embrace unschooling.  Or rather if I can embrace the technology I will be closer to getting unschooling.<br>\n\n    </div>\n\n\n\n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

There is no way Steiner&nbsp; wrote about keeping kids from TV and computers. There were no such thing at that time or even when Steiner died.<br>You should not\n believe some crazy thing you read saying are going to have a terrible disease at 35 if you watch media .&nbsp; Look at your children, See what they are seeing.<br>See how wonderful computers and tables are. They bring the big wide world to you . You can travel to Everest and looks at videos and pictures and even hear the sounds of the wind howling !

Oh it&#39;s very confusing. \nMy husband says if I can just come to peace with this part of life (which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... Plenty of people don&#39;t have televisions) I will be able to embrace unschooling.  Or rather if I can embrace the technology I will be closer to getting unschooling.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>But you are here using the computer!!!!!!&nbsp; Isn&#39;t it a tad ironic? You say it is all very confusing because someone created a school that tells your child should not have access to media and technology 100 years ago when they did not even have TVs??? Someone a tad crazy&nbsp; if you read about him.<br>One can always decide all technology is crap and go live in a very remote village where they don&#39;t even have running water or electricity. No need for TV there!!!!<br><br>I know I am being picky here . I am glad you are trying to look into your fears and your husband is so supportive. <br>I wish people did not get so scared by\n doom-professing people. You know the run of the mill If your child watches TV their brain will melt and they will have a horrible disease by the time they are 35 or your child will be living in your basement and a looser because they love video game.<br><br><br></div><div style=\"font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\"><div style=\"font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1431603316y_msg_container\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905\"><div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905ygrp-mlmsg\" style=\"\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905ygrp-msg\" style=\"\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905ygrp-text\">\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\">_<br></div></div></div></div></div><br></div> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lpet4TJi41A?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":360440773,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;kgharriman1@...&gt;","profile":"kirsty_harriman","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: How to tell when screens are being used to escape","postDate":"1391562151","msgId":73455,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxjczJqNytzN2FydTRAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY2Q0ZFOTZGLTNCMkUtNEFFNi05MkUzLUU0NjQ1RDg3QUQzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxjbm82ayt0N212Z0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw1RUU3NTg1NS0yRENFLTQ3QzktQTIyQS1CN0QzNTFEMzM2M0ZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDwxMzkxNTUzMjU2LjU4NjQ5LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWIxODIyMDYubWFpbC5iZjEueWFob28uY29tPgk8RjZDRkU5NkYtM0IyRS00QUU2LTkyRTMtRTQ2NDVEODdBRDNGQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":73454,"nextInTopic":73456,"prevInTime":73454,"nextInTime":73456,"topicId":73427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a friend who had a bad car accident and played lots of video games to improve her memory.

It is very big to her especially since we got wifi hooked up in our house on weekend.\nIt helps to put self into child&#39;s shoes with husband example. Offers that insight where you are indeed a partner not a dictator. \nI would love to come to terms with technology. I am quite old fashioned in this way. \nMy husband gets this so much better than me. We have been trying to tear apart my fears and biases and strongly uncomfortable feelings around children looking at ipod or computer or TV. .. I am looking at the clock and wondering if she will ever play with her toys again. I am worried about our 2 and 4 year Olds and their sudden increase in exposure to these technological devices. Our 2 year old daughter sits transfixed when something is on. I do have a really hard time with this.  All my Waldorf reading indicates they will contract some terrible disease at 35 if they are &quot;awakened&quot; too early from early academics or watching media. It&#39;s scary stuff and after reading Waldorf materials for the past three years I am now basically saying everything Mr Steiner said was rubbish! Oh it&#39;s very confusing. \nMy husband says if I can just come to peace with this part of life (which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... Plenty of people don&#39;t have televisions) I will be able to embrace unschooling.  Or rather if I can embrace the technology I will be closer to getting unschooling.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] How to tell when screens are being used to escape","postDate":"1391553256","msgId":73438,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzOTE1NTMyNTYuNTg2NDkuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE4MjIwNi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDVFRTc1ODU1LTJEQ0UtNDdDOS1BMjJBLUI3RDM1MUQzMzYzRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxjbm82ayt0N212Z0BZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDw1RUU3NTg1NS0yRENFLTQ3QzktQTIyQS1CN0QzNTFEMzM2M0ZAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73437,"nextInTopic":73440,"prevInTime":73437,"nextInTime":73439,"topicId":73427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I really do not understand why people shun and fear technology and screens !
