However, since both spouses are non natives of the country, it would seem that these struggles wouldn&#39;t be unique to one spouse over the other.  Some of the cultural challenges that present in a workplace can be different than those faced by a stay at home parent, but many of them overlap. Some people would struggle regardless of their country of residence or how much support of family or friends they receive. <br/>\nI don&#39;t know the &quot;right&quot; path forward for the poster or her family.  In reading the responses though, I felt this point above was worth mentioning. For what it&#39;s worth, both my husband and I grew up outside the US, in different countries from each other, we met in the US in college, and have moved for his job to 2 other very culturally different countries as well. I can relate to the difficulty of life in a new, unknown culture. <br/>\nMaybe the husband should spend a few months back in his home country and would perhaps see the darkness follows him and isn&#39;t because of his wife or where they live? <br/>\nI hope things improve for them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":77077,"nextTopicId":77088}}
