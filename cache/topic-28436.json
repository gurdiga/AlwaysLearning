Not quite to the extent that your son is perhaps but surely close enough.  I do try to realize it&#39;s just who she is, sensitve to certain things as I and her dad and even her brother are.  At an age when they are just learning to understand their anonymity it is understandable that their feelings are difficult for them to deal with.  Is he sensitive about other things?  It&#39;s probobly best to acknowledge his feelings and provide a strong presence for him.
