I&#39;m afraid he was so damaged by school and conventional parenting by that point that he wanted to drop out of everything. Once when he was about 14 someone asked him why he didn&#39;t take pride in the things he did. His response was that school had taken all the pride out of him. The reason he waited until he 16 was because that is the legal age in our state that he could quit going to school without parents&#39; permission, which wasn&#39;t an issue because I would&#39;ve registered us as homeschoolers if he didn&#39;t want to go to school. I think he just wanted to be done with all of it at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Starting late?","postDate":"1270736392","msgId":52559,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDA5RTRGMUMyLTBENTQtNDMyNS05NDEyLTYwQzU0M0U2OTM1MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhwa2x0dStxcXQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhwa2x0dStxcXQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52558,"nextInTopic":52585,"prevInTime":52558,"nextInTime":52560,"topicId":52536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- After that he went back and forth in and out of public school of his own choice (and pressure from my husband and some outside sources) before he decided","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1026090691\">-=- After that he went back and forth in and out of public school of  <br/>\nhis own choice (and pressure from my husband and some outside sources)  <br/>\nbefore he decided to drop out at 16.

He was 12, almost 13, when I finally pulled him out of school. He&#39;s 19 now. We didn&#39;t go straight into unschooling. We spent probably the first year deschooling and investigating curricula. After that he went back and forth in and out of public school of his own choice (and pressure from my husband and some outside sources) before he decided to drop out at 16. I considered that the beginning of his unschooling experience. I don&#39;t know that I have any words of wisdom.
