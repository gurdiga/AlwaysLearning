I don&#39;t think on a planet of over six billion people who  <br/>\nfly around from continent to continent all the time that anyone  <br/>\nanymore should think of any &quot;right mate.&quot;  Certainly not THE right mate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just in from two solid hours of working in the yard, digging,  <br/>\nundoing and turning a big compost bin, clearing out a big two-year-old  <br/>\n(or more) pile of branches and small trees and an old christmas tree  <br/>\nand moving rocks, and when I do things like that, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith won&#39;t consider it &quot;cleaned out,&quot; because there will be an  <br/>\nunexpected pile of stuff for him to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, one of the things I was thinking was fate and destiny and  <br/>\ncalling.  I often do think about things I don&#39;t believe in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause Facebook is for whatever reasons cooking up, lots of old  <br/>\nfriends of mine have joined lately, so some of us are talking about  <br/>\nwhen we were kids, and some of my SCA friends from 25, 30 years ago  <br/>\nare catching up and telling me stories, and lots of people I know are  <br/>\nretiring from &quot;professions&quot; and callings.  Several of them are  <br/>\nteachers, were teachers, retired and are teaching in different  <br/>\ncapacities now, and they&#39;re summarizing years of work and change and  <br/>\ngrowth and confusion on facebook.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo generation ever has had this before.  When people wrote a lot of  <br/>\nletters--the 18th century and that, when people &quot;wrote their letters&quot;  <br/>\nevery morning (kind of like checking e-mail now) and &quot;entertained  <br/>\ncallers&quot; in the afternoon (kind of like chatrooms or going out for  <br/>\ncoffee now) they seem to have tended neither to spill their guts nor  <br/>\nto talk much philosophy.   There were niceties and formulaeic  <br/>\nconversations.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here I find myself, being me, summarizing what I&#39;ve done in thirty  <br/>\nyears, to various kinds of people who know me in various kinds of  <br/>\nways--many of them very will, in one window or phase of my life or  <br/>\nanother.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting.   I suppose I&#39;m still &quot;involved in education,&quot; as  <br/>\nthat goes.<br/>\nI can&#39;t retire, because I didn&#39;t stick with any one job long enough to  <br/>\n&quot;retire.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe things I wanted to do when I was little--be a teacher, a  <br/>\nmissionary or a magazine writer--all rolled together to be  <br/>\nSandraDodd.com, maybe, and this list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":43155,"nextTopicId":43180}}
