He seems kind of oblivious when he&#39;s doing it.

I know we talked about running<br/>\naround naked inside/outside but how about our son (6yo.) touching<br/>\nhimself all day. I told him that&#39;s his private parts and he should do<br/>\nthat when he&#39;s alone. It doesn&#39;t bother me when he does it in the<br/>\nhouse, it really bothers DH. DH says i gotta put some clothes on him<br/>\nso he wont do that all the time. Well...he does it with his clothes on<br/>\ntoo. DH took him to the playground today and he son our son was doing<br/>\nit there and some girls were looking at him,pointing and laughing. Our<br/>\nson is so stubborn about this. He&#39;s very animated doing it in the<br/>\nhouse,flipping it,bending it when he talking to us.
