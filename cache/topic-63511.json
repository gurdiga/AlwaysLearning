Where did it come from?  <br/>\nWho gave you the idea he needs to spend his childhood preparing to be  <br/>\nan adult? Why is being a child not seen as acceptable by society?  <br/>\nBecause kids outgrow it? ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why isn&#39;t video games a potential career? The people who designed  <br/>\nMinecraft undoubtedly spent their childhoods playing video games! :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe learning that comes from video games isn&#39;t just applicable to more  <br/>\nvideo games. Video games tap into real world skills. A lot of the  <br/>\nproblem solving in video games mimics real life. Read here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/videogames/\">http://sandradodd.com/videogames/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact the first link is about Minecraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeems to me someone brought a link here recently to an article about  <br/>\nhow video gamers solved a science problem that had been baffling  <br/>\nscientists for years. You may want to keep an eye out for that as you  <br/>\nread back through the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you play with him? Do you have your own account? The more you know  <br/>\nabout what your child is interested in, the more connected you are and  <br/>\nthe more you can help him explore what interests him and connect him  <br/>\nwith other things that might interest him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I keep thinking he should<br/>\n&gt; be looking for something he could study on his own so he will be  <br/>\n&gt; happy as an<br/>\n&gt; adult making money in something he enjoys.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why is being happy right now not a good goal? Really think about that!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it reasonable to expect someone to find what they&#39;ll love in the  <br/>\nfuture by doing things they don&#39;t love right now?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn&#39;t it make more sense that people will discover all sorts of  <br/>\nthings they love by exploring what intrigues them? In a rich  <br/>\nenvironment where they&#39;re supported in what they love and have  <br/>\nswirling around them other things they could pick up and explore to  <br/>\nfind potential new loves?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs he happy choosing Minecraft? But you want him to give up that  <br/>\nhappiness to do things that would sooth your worries so that he can  <br/>\n(you believe) be a happy adult? Where&#39;s the guarantee that will happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I keep thinking he should<br/>\n&gt; be looking for something he could study<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>For one thing, he *is* studying Minecraft right now! He sees the value  <br/>\nin it. If you can&#39;t, is it because you&#39;re more knowledgeable about it  <br/>\nor because he is?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor another thing: Unschooling is not *not* NOT kids exploring  <br/>\nschoolish looking activities on their own! (This is a fairly common  <br/>\nmisconception.) Unschooling looks exactly like what you&#39;re worried  <br/>\nthat he&#39;s doing right now: Playing!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe humans play for a reason: It&#39;s how we explore and discover and  <br/>\nlearn. We learn by exploring what intrigues us and playing &quot;What  <br/>\nif...?&quot; &quot;What if I do this? What happens? Why did that happen? Let&#39;s  <br/>\ndo more and see what happens.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe learn very very poorly by people telling us the answers to  <br/>\nquestions we haven&#39;t asked yet. IT&#39;s why it takes school so long to do  <br/>\nwhat they do.
