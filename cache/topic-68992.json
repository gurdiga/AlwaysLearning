In our neighbourhood, the school kids are doing lots of cool things around that time - parties, festivals, picnics, trips.

that learning is happening because your 7 year old is a fantastic reader.***<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a fantastic reader isn&#39;t the best indicator that learning is happening.  This is especially true for unschooling families.  When learning looks totally different from what happens in school, it&#39;s best to see the learning in the activities that your children are doing.  You will have a very hard time measuring their learning based on school learning if they aren&#39;t doing school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most common examples of this is the multiplication tables.  There is this discrepancy in what &quot;looks&quot; like learning on the surface that happens especially in the 8-13 ish age range.  Kids in school will appear to have all this vast knowledge that unschooling kids won&#39;t.  Kids in school are on this very tight schedule to fit in all this knowledge.  Kids that are 9 (at least around here) must know multiplication tables.  If a kid reaches 10 and doesn&#39;t know this, they are behind, there is a deficit in that kid.  So when your unschooled 9 yr old doesn&#39;t know multiplication, it&#39;s easy to say, &quot;we&#39;re working on that&quot;, but when they reach 10 or 11 and still don&#39;t know it, it&#39;s hard to counter that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe learning curve of an unschooler looks different.  Most kids will learn how to multiply in their own way and time.  If an unschooling parent can&#39;t see all that other learning that&#39;s happening that isn&#39;t school based, they are going to have a very hard time, a)defending what they do, and b)relaxing enough to not worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was around 11 she wanted to know what multiplication was.  Her school friends seemed to think it was a pretty big deal that she didn&#39;t know it.  We did a quick 10 min demonstration and that was all it took for her to understand it.  Her friends had been working on it for a couple of years at that point.  Right before she turned 18, she was going to do a GED program at the local community college.  She had to do a placement test.  Her lowest score was in math, but it was still in the range of normal, and even at the level she got, it put her in the realm of being able to take college courses.  All those years and only one single 10 min math demonstration and she was still on par with her school age peers, except she doesn&#39;t hate math and isn&#39;t afraid of it like many of her peers.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":439465581,"authorName":"Robert and Colleen","from":"&quot;Robert and Colleen&quot;

Yesterday, we found a worm on the sidewalk and <br/>\nthe girls played with it and made observations about it and asked questions <br/>\nabout it. It was all in the context of play.

Sharing <br/>\nis part of our lives.<br/>\nSomething else to think about is how approachable you are. If the kids think <br/>\nthat you are busy or will get mad for interrupting, then they are not as <br/>\nlikely to share with you.

(cringes in fear of response to that) :-) and feel like <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m &#39;waiting&#39; for either one to come to me to as for help to get this <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or that, facilitate a need.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Sounds like you need to play more! Don’t amuse yourself, find something to <br/>\ndo that brings you joy and happiness. Don’t wait for them to come to you. Do <br/>\nsomething fun. If you run across something cool, share it with them. Go <br/>\nwatch what they are doing. You don’t have to play with them but you can sit <br/>\nand watch. I will do that periodically. I will walk over to one of the girls <br/>\nand stroke her hair and say, “how’s it going?” or “Just wanted to say I love <br/>\nyou.” Then, I go about my business. Sometimes, they will open up and tell me <br/>\nall about what they are doing and ask me for input.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it because they see that I am &#39;busy&#39; that they continue to play or do I <br/>\ncontinue to &#39;busy myself&#39; because they are playing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They will not allow me to play their game with them, fair enough ;-) so <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;obviously they are content and happy to fire up their own imaginations <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and creativity in doing what they dig... which is play!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Give them more stuff to be imaginative with. I found a store that had some <br/>\nlittle puppets for a dollar so I stocked up on puppets. If they like dolls, <br/>\nget them dolls. Offer to make new sew clothes for the dolls using old socks <br/>\nthat don’t have mates. There are tons of things that can be done to feed the <br/>\nimagination without directing the play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The &#39;worries&#39; I imagine do come from an external source. My Mum feels <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that they should be doing something &#39;constructive&#39; everyday. Each <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time we talk she will say &quot;have they learnt to tell the time yet? can <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they do their times tables? What is OD&#39;s grammar like? Can YD <br/>\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;read/spell yet? Why don&#39;t you do this or that?&quot; etc Aghhhhhhh!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I tend to find something that the girls can do that I can share with family <br/>\nmembers that question. A simple answer like “We are working on it.” works <br/>\nfor some people. They don’t need to know that my idea of working on it is <br/>\nplaying and having fun. : –)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy niece (who is now 20) is the one that helped me find my confidence. She <br/>\nhas been hanging out with us since she was a baby and I helped her mom <br/>\nhomeschool her for a while. We were talking one day and she made the remark <br/>\nthat she can’t come to my house without learning something because we always <br/>\nhave cool toys and are always sharing interesting/weird/different stuff. She <br/>\nnever knows what kind of food, toy, book, instrument, computer game, etc. <br/>\nshe will see when she comes over.

More connecting, more strewing, more sharing life and joy, more discovering new things together, more learning together about what your kid;s interests are, more creating a learning environment, more opportunities to discover new things. But  it not directing play, or directing learning, or directing kids to schoolish subjects. If a parent is not seeing learning and not  aware of what the child is learning and doing  maybe that parents needs more deschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling%c2%a0\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/learning%c2%a0\">http://sandradodd.com/learning%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;Are they learning enough, are they getting what they need? <br/>\nI know that natural learning is happening because my 7 yr old taught herself to read at 5 and now is a fantastic reader. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n She learned to read.

I do not know all of the time tables but I can figure them out in a few seconds ( the ones I never remember).<br/>\nI have a Law Degree and I speak a few languages. I have worked with many different things over the years. I can also do algebra really well. I actually love doing it. Those big puzzles are fun! But I do not know all the time tables~!<br/>\n It does sound like you need some more deschooling. <br/>\nI was just talking to a dad that homeschools yesterday and he was telling me he knew all this chemistry stuff a few years ago but since he is not working with it anymore he forgot them all. <br/>\nDo you really remember everything you were taught in school as a child? Do you think the children in school do?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot a question to answer but to ponder.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf you think you are not doing enough, do more. Connect with them more, play with them more, share things that you find interesting! Offer more, bring more home ( since they like to be home), strew more. <br/>\n|<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":435362655,"authorName":"Stephanie Kleiner","from":"Stephanie Kleiner &lt;ssminnow1@...&gt;","profile":"ssminnow1@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Too much play?","postDate":"1347471103","msgId":69007,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNDc0NzExMDMuMTg3MTMuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjExMzkwNy5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDc0NjQ4MDYuOTA2MTcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEUzQTJDMkQ2LTdDN0ItNDI1Ri1BQUQ0LUIyRDhCNzc5M0EyMUB5bWFpbC5jb20+IDxDQU1TdTdOeUQzUj0zYUQwaXFYZG80S21SRmdiU2NQdW1zNmg1dWJZckQxSzAtRFNOT1FAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDwxMzQ3NDY0ODA2LjkwNjE3LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4MTUwOC5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69006,"nextInTopic":69008,"prevInTime":69006,"nextInTime":69008,"topicId":68992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-549494228\">&lt;&lt;&lt;I think that it is the time of the year.

Adults<br/>\nfacilitate learning, in a Constructivist model - they don&#39;t teach.  And lots<br/>\nand lots of play in an environment rich with materials (toys, gadgets,<br/>\ngames, art supplies, etc.) is key.  Because through play, children are<br/>\nexperimenting and exploring and thinking and evaluating. and therefore<br/>\nlearning :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this vein, I think of one of my major roles as an unschooling parent as<br/>\nmaking sure my child is surrounded with interesting people, items, and<br/>\nexperiences.  I don&#39;t stand back and see what happens as he makes his own<br/>\nway in his own world - I (and my husband) actively create a fun world for<br/>\nhim to play in and then I (and my husband) participate and play in it with<br/>\nhim :-).  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my son (who is now 9) plays with and around a variety of things that come<br/>\nfrom his interests, my interests, my husband&#39;s interests, our friends&#39;<br/>\ninterests, etc.  I watch what he likes, what he asks, what he&#39;s curious or<br/>\npassionate about, and I provide more of that or expansions of that - but I<br/>\ndon&#39;t provide or expand with attachment to the outcome. I think of myself<br/>\n(borrowing a phrase this time from early childhood education) as being<br/>\nattached to the process, not the product :-)  Sometimes he joins me in<br/>\nexploring something I think up, and sometimes (like right now) he&#39;s nearby<br/>\nand we&#39;re chatting while doing completely different things - he&#39;s playing<br/>\nPokemon, I&#39;m reading/writing email, we&#39;re listening to music (Silly Wizard,<br/>\ncurrently), and we&#39;re chatting about what we did and didn&#39;t like about<br/>\nAvatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. we&#39;re a multi-tasking<br/>\nsort of family, it seems ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Too much play?","postDate":"1347467819","msgId":69004,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2M0U2RjlFLUE3NTgtNEEwNS1BODM0LUE0ODI3NENDNkM1OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDc0NjQzMzAuODMzODYuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA3Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEUzQTJDMkQ2LTdDN0ItNDI1Ri1BQUQ0LUIyRDhCNzc5M0EyMUB5bWFpbC5jb20+IDwxMzQ3NDY0MzMwLjgzMzg2LllhaG9vTWFpbE5lb0B3ZWI4MTUwNy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":69003,"nextInTopic":69005,"prevInTime":69003,"nextInTime":69005,"topicId":68992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- More connecting, more strewing, more sharing life and joy, more discovering new things together, more learning together about what your kid;s interests","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1825371458\">-=- More connecting, more strewing, more sharing life and joy, more discovering new things together, more learning together about what your kid;s interests are, more creating a learning environment, more opportunities to discover new things. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.

The children rarely want to leave the house because they are engrossed in playing something.  <br/>\nAm I failing them because they do not know their times tables, etc.,or aren&#39;t being taught what other kids are learning?<br/>\nStephanie K <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Too much play?","postDate":"1347458588","msgId":68994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGsycTRtcytpbmplQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGsycHRucis3MWNqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":68992,"nextInTopic":68995,"prevInTime":68993,"nextInTime":68995,"topicId":68992,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==Is it because they see that I am busy that they continue to play or do I continue to busy myself because they are playing?== I have wondered about this","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1663570124\">==Is it because they see that I am &#39;busy&#39; that they continue to play or do I continue to &#39;busy myself&#39; because they are playing?==<br/>\n<br/>\nI have wondered about this sometimes.

We have been on our home ed (autonomous) journey for 4 years now and just in the last year their focus is just soooo much on play play play... and more play then some play and more play (with a few altercations in between of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have naturally been concerned about this at times, then read a little, then watched, then let it (mentally) &#39;go&#39; in other words... *not* worry about it so much then read some more about it (Alan Thomas, Harriet Pattison and Holt).  But to be honest my concerns still sit at the back of my mind poking my &#39;worry button&#39; every now and then!<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay is of course vital, I know that, and very important to development and learning, emotional and otherwise but as I sit and amuse myself with organising their/our diaries, do a bit of knitting etc, tidy up, do the washing blah blah blah I feel &#39;out of it&#39; lonely and I admit at times... Bored!  (cringes in fear of response to that) :-) and feel like I&#39;m &#39;waiting&#39; for either one to come to me to as for help to get this or that, facilitate a need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it because they see that I am &#39;busy&#39; that they continue to play or do I continue to &#39;busy myself&#39; because they are playing?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will not allow me to play their game with them, fair enough ;-) so obviously they are content and happy to fire up their own imaginations and creativity in doing what they dig... which is play!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have often asked either of them (while they are playing) if they&#39;d like me to read to them (or do something else).  Either being read to or &#39;doing something else&#39; with both or either of them is something that we would have spoken about the day/s before we promised we would do.  They appear so distracted with each other&#39;s needs I can&#39;t seem to pin one of them down without the other wanting &#39;in&#39; too.  Which of course I don&#39;t mind either.  But as we all do at times need peace and relaxation, one or the other just won&#39;t allow it to happen with out a too doo or a hoo har!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;worries&#39; I imagine do come from an external source.  My Mum feels that they should be doing something &#39;constructive&#39; everyday.  Each time we talk she will say &quot;have they learnt to tell the time yet? can they do their times tables?  What is OD&#39;s grammar like? Can YD read/spell yet? Why don&#39;t you do this or that?&quot; etc Aghhhhhhh!<br/>\n<br/>\nI embrace anything they want to do if I&#39;m able.  If one comes away from the play situation they would usually go on their nintendo or draw or want to help with preparing meals.  They have groups they attend and we as a home ed community have a big support network and often get together so they have lots of choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... I guess my main need for discussion/help/advice really is &quot;is there a ever such a thing as too much play?&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":69014,"nextTopicId":68980}}
