If a person <br/>\nwho is<br/>\nreligious can become an atheist because of depression, does it mean that<br/>\nfaith, or the perception of God, or spirituality, is controlled by some<br/>\nfunction of the brain, which depression interrupts?  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If the answer to any of that is &quot;yes,&quot; does it mean that God does not <br/>\nexist,<br/>\nthat our perceptions are delusions which plague some but not others, or does<br/>\nit mean he/she/it *does* exist, and has created these structures or<br/>\nfunctions in order to have contact with us?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;My religion&#39;s hagiography is replete with saints whose visions could be <br/>\njust<br/>\nas easily described as hallucinations; were they just nuts, or can severe<br/>\nfasting account for them?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow... What fascinating questions!  You&#39;ve reminded me of a book a friend <br/>\nrecommended to me recently.  I&#39;m going to try to borrow it today.  It&#39;s <br/>\ncalled &quot;Lying Awake&quot; by Mark Salzman.  The blurb on Amazon says the book <br/>\n&quot;...probes the nature of spiritual illumination.&quot;  It&#39;s about a middle-aged <br/>\ncloistered nun in LA who is languishing in a spiritual drought.  That is <br/>\nuntil she begins receiving intense, rapturous mystical visions.  <br/>\nUnfortunately, they&#39;re accompanied by excruciating headaches and blacking <br/>\nout.  She learns she has a form of epilepsy that commonly brings this type <br/>\nof experience about.  Now she&#39;s faced with the decision of whether ot go <br/>\nahead with surgery and risk obliterating her spiritual life and her art, or <br/>\n&quot;...cling to a state of grace that may actually be a delsuion ignited by an <br/>\nelectrochemical imbalance.  At the bottom there lurks a profound meditation <br/>\non the mystery of artistic inspiration.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThought some others may be interested in checking this out as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Stacey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp.</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":728,"nextTopicId":751}}
