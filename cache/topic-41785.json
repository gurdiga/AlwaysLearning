Force them to stop because itsÂ  :eyeball roll: surely an addiction? Make them stop for a while because something else has to be done? <br/>\n<br/>\nI had to limit Court&#39;s time on WOW today because we had to go pick up her brother from school. We just moved and I don&#39;t know any neighbors yet that i could call to check on her or she could go running to if there was a problem . Its a good 15 minute drive to the school so if she were to call me I couldn&#39;t just dash home so I just dont feel ok leaving a 9 year old home alone in the current situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing she hates transition ...what kid dosent when they have to stop doing something they love ?...I made it as pleasant as possible for her. I gave her a few warnings ... 30 minutes left ..ok you are down to 5 and need to get where you can log out ...and asked if she wanted me to grab anything for her to take like her ipod. <br/>\n<br/>\nI see sometimes having to limit time on something as a necessary part of being part of a family. <br/>\n<br/>\nNicole <br/>\n<br/>\nNever play with hot lava in the house ~Alyssa,5<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Wed, 2/4/09, Jill Parmer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jparmer@...\">jparmer@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\nFrom: Jill Parmer &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jparmer@...\">jparmer@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Misconceptions about unschooling<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Wednesday, February 4, 2009, 9:57 PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n            Today, I listened to a blog radio interview from the Unschoolers  <br/>\n<br/>\nWinter Waterpark Gathering.
