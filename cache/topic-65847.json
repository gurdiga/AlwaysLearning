When we moved to where we currently live there were several unschooling  groups in the county, all on Yahoo, which I pulled together in a central Facebook group. That group has grown to more than 50 families. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe unschoolers in our group range from more eclectic/relaxed homeschoolers moving towards unschooling to a few of us who are radical unschoolers.   We do a weekly park day with the group as well as outings that various people set up. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough we still attend some activities lately Caitlyn has been less interested in park days and scheduled activities and more in favor of staying home or doing smaller get-togethers. I&#39;m not the only one who is also experiencing this. Sometimes a park day has several families that plan to attend and by the time the day arrives, kids have decided they want to do something else like staying home. So, while it&#39;s nice to have local unschooling families for support and connection, I&#39;ve come to realize it&#39;s not the necessity I once believed it was. I&#39;m sure as Caitlyn gets older, we will find connections based more on shared interests than simply because other families are unschoolers. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the Internet is a huge part of our unschooling connection. And as I said above, even our local group is very active online.

Although this has been our fourth year homeschooling, (now<br/>\ntransitioning to unschooling), this has been our first year with access to<br/>\na homeschool group. We live in a fairly small town and the groups are all<br/>\nreligious. It&#39;s been challenging. I only know of one unschooling mom, but<br/>\nshe is pretty busy.

I just got back from our &quot;Unschoolers<br/>\nand Others&quot; park day.  This is a group headed up by an unschooler, but<br/>\neveryone is welcome.  Several of the families are &quot;eclectic&quot; and some<br/>\nfollow some kind of curriculum for all subjects, but all of the families<br/>\nare good at allowing the children to play as they want and only getting<br/>\ninvolved when asked to do so by the children.  For instance, none of the<br/>\nparents went spastic when most of the kids were playing volley ball<br/>\nbarefooted (in Maryland in February).  The kids range in age from 4 to 16<br/>\nand they usually play all together and organize things amongst themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had several new families come today, which was great.  Two of the moms<br/>\nthat came with their children seemed very curriculum based, very new to<br/>\nhomeschooling and seemed to be looking for some support.  Both of these new<br/>\nmoms related that they had been desperately looking for a group in the area<br/>\nthat they felt would be &quot;comfortable&quot; (code for not fundamentally<br/>\nreligious, homeschooling for God folks).  Neither had met any other<br/>\nhomeschooling families that weren&#39;t in some religious group, and then they<br/>\nfound that we secular homeschoolers actually outnumber  (looking at the<br/>\nnumbers of the various groups) the religious ones.  My point being that you<br/>\nare probably not the only unschooling or relaxed or at least relaxed enough<br/>\nhomeschooler desperate to meet someone who is also not strict about things<br/>\nin general.  Maybe you could try starting an email group with the intent of<br/>\nhaving weekly park days or game days or play dates.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe worse that could happen is that you get no response.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":403767111,"authorName":"Jo Isaac","from":"Jo Isaac &lt;joanneisaac@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.isaac","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] question about homeschool vs unschool groups","postDate":"1329956074","msgId":65862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERVQjEwMS1XNTk4RTMxNjBFRDhBNzQzRjQxMzlFRkI3NjUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PGppMzlhcitpMzVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGppMzlhcitpMzVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65861,"nextInTopic":65863,"prevInTime":65861,"nextInTime":65863,"topicId":65847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==did you just meet/hang out with other unschoolers, or homeschoolers and unschoolers?== Since we discovered unschooling, we ve lived in a few different","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-394057585\">==did you just meet/hang out with other unschoolers, or homeschoolers and unschoolers?==<br/>\n <br/>\nSince we discovered unschooling, we&#39;ve lived in a few different places.

When our daughter was younger, around 4, I thought being a good mom meant finding all kinds of exciting social activities for my only child.  Ha! If she had been a lonely child, that would have been fine and maybe welcomed.  But she was actually very happy to spend her time with her family and family friends. Her favorite outings were into the woods with me or Michael. Playgrounds were stressful during busy times because they were so noisy and other kids were unpredictable; story times were frustrating because Noor liked to be read to in her own very non-linear way; and the few dance classes she went to were an exercise in standing in line and waiting your turn to do fun things to music :(<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are very few radical unschoolers where we live, and while Noor&#39;s best friends now are other homeschooled kids, we&#39;re the only ones who radically unschool.  The co-ops we&#39;ve gone to were way too academically focused. The larger playdates were more about moms getting a chance to socialize, I think, than experiences where deep friendships flourished between kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe food thing can be really annoying in larger groups, as can the way other moms bitch about their kids. Probably even more frustrating is the way moms either ignore or try to control the kids. I&#39;ve found that for us, we&#39;ve done much better fostering close relationships with a few families rather than being active in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if your kids are old enough to enjoy Skype, that&#39;s another really wonderful way for unschooled kids to connect, play games together, draw, role play......<br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":231154952,"authorName":"Pam Laricchia","from":"Pam Laricchia &lt;pam@...&gt;","profile":"learn2day2002","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] question about homeschool vs unschool groups","postDate":"1329951647","msgId":65860,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGNDU3MzlGLjIwMDAwMDVAbGl2aW5nam95ZnVsbHkuY2E+","inReplyToHeader":"PGppMzlhcitpMzVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGppMzlhcitpMzVvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65856,"nextInTopic":65861,"prevInTime":65859,"nextInTime":65861,"topicId":65847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" We haven t focused much","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-640383031\">&lt;&lt; Do you find issues or problems doing things with other homeschoolers?

That can definitely be nice, as typically the families are more likely to<br/>\nshare your parenting goals, but life doesn&#39;t need to be isolated to this slice of society. There are nice schooled kids as well. Over the years we<br/>\nhave definitely enjoyed going to unschooling conferences and my kids have made good friends that way, but gathering around shared interests is also a<br/>\ngreat way to meet and hang out locally with others in a wide range of ages (for us, so far it&#39;s been karate, girl guides, and the local animal shelter<br/>\n- the kids are 14, 17, and 19 now). And from these acquaintances, friendships can grow as the kids find additional common ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe motivation wasn&#39;t mentioned, but it&#39;s worth it to take a moment and ask yourself if your kids are interested in pursuing those outside<br/>\nrelationships, or whether it&#39;s a parent thinking that it&#39;s necessary. If as a parent you&#39;re asking them to participate in things they aren&#39;t<br/>\ninterested in doing, chances are they won&#39;t be learning what you hope. If they don&#39;t want to be there, maybe they&#39;re thinking about what they wish<br/>\nthey were doing instead, not about connecting with those around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it&#39;s a vicious circle: a parent takes their children out places because they want them to make friends; the kids wish they weren&#39;t there so they<br/>\nthink of other things to pass the time, not participating fully and/or connecting with others there; the parent sees that and thinks they need more<br/>\n&quot;practice&quot; making friends so they take them out more. Round and round and round with frustration on both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve had fun by focusing on the things we like to do and gathering with others that like to do them too, regardless of the educational approaches<br/>\nchosen by the other families involved. It sometimes sparks interesting conversations with the kids about parenting too.

I am not sure, it just doesn&#39;t feel right.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you find issues or problems doing things with other homeschoolers?  Is it best to just try to associate with other unschoolers?<br/>\n<br/>\nStacey</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":65864,"nextTopicId":65903}}
