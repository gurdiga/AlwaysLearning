You sound so tired. You write of<br/>\n<br/>\nbeing afraid of what will happen if you step away from timeouts and <br/>\ncountdowns to spankings. You write THEIRS in shouting capitals and write<br/>\n<br/>\ni in lower case tiny letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound so tired and so angry. When I was pregnant with Linnaea, my <br/>\nsecond child, I was tired. I was grouchy. I didn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>\npatience. I was working part time when I was pregnant which felt like <br/>\nthe only time when I got a break. And I felt horribly guilty for <br/>\nenjoying the break. For enjoying being able to go over to the cafeteria <br/>\non the Fridays when I went into the VA and get a coke and just sit at my<br/>\n<br/>\ncomputer and work without any distractions. It was lovely to be all on <br/>\nmy own. I&#39;ve never really felt that way at any other time. I&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>\nthe luxury of walking quickly to the shops or of not having to be <br/>\nslightly vigilantly aware of where everyone is when going somewhere <br/>\nelse, but I enjoyed the &quot;just me time&quot; when I was pregnant with Linnaea <br/>\nmore than I ever have before or since. I&#39;m not suggesting that you need <br/>\n&quot;me time&quot; with your pregnancy in the same way that I did, but maybe you <br/>\nare tired. Maybe, as this parasitic growth inside you gets closer and <br/>\ncloser to birth, and is taking more and more from you to support her <br/>\nlife, you have less to give to your other dependents. Maybe you need to <br/>\nschedule in your day pick me ups, little energy boosts of a banana <br/>\nmilkshake or an energy bar or 10 minutes of you and a cup of tea and <br/>\nsome cookies. Maybe you need to think about what really needs to get <br/>\ndone in a day. Maybe you could fix a bunch of freezable meals when your <br/>\nhusband is around that you could just pop in the oven or microwave for <br/>\nthe days when he isn&#39;t around, so that you don&#39;t have to choose between <br/>\nbeing with your children and standing at the stove. Maybe you could get <br/>\na crock pot and cook dinner all day and not have to spend a particular <br/>\ntime stuck to the stove. Maybe if you have to cook you could set up <br/>\nsomething for the boys to do while you are cooking, a video or a game or<br/>\n<br/>\ntime on the computer or something that would keep them entertained so <br/>\nthat you don&#39;t have to feel pulled in to many directions. Maybe you <br/>\ncould order pizza on the nights when you just can&#39;t cope anymore. Or buy<br/>\n<br/>\na few frozen ones to have as back up for when baseball was too <br/>\ndistracting to keep you standing at the stove.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what you &quot;have&quot; to do. I don&#39;t know what things in your <br/>\nhouse are piling up from one day to the next. If I don&#39;t get done what I<br/>\n<br/>\nwant to on one day it doesn&#39;t feel that bad to address it the next. Are <br/>\nthere ways that you can make your required labor less intense. Buy some <br/>\nboxes on wheels to toss toys into when you need to clean up the living <br/>\nroom. Soak dishes overnight and do the dishes in the morning. Try and <br/>\nminimize how much you feel you need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t good that they are breaking windows or that they are breaking <br/>\nthings that are yours. Maybe if you give them something they can play <br/>\nwith in the house when they are trying to use something that will break <br/>\nor will break other things they won&#39;t respond so angrily. Simon just got<br/>\n<br/>\nan indoor frisbee &quot;called a Superang&quot; for his birthday. Pillows are <br/>\nusually pretty good, oh, Simon discovered a while ago that a tam, little<br/>\n<br/>\nround knitted hat that lies flat when it isn&#39;t worn, makes a great <br/>\nindoor frisbee. You could talk to them about why it isn&#39;t okay to play <br/>\nwith certain things in the house. Simon got this cool electronic circuit<br/>\n<br/>\nbuilding set for Christmas that has, among other things, a spinning disc<br/>\n<br/>\nthat you build a launcher for. One of the paintings in our house got <br/>\nchipped by the disc, and so it isn&#39;t something that we use in the living<br/>\n<br/>\nroom unless I&#39;ve draped a blanket over the painting.  If something is <br/>\nimportant to you that it not be broken you might want to make sure that <br/>\nit isn&#39;t accessible. If they want to go in the pool when you think it is<br/>\n<br/>\ntoo cold, get lots of towels and be prepared to warm them up, make some <br/>\nhot chocolate or give them a nice warm bath or shower when they are <br/>\ndone. Maybe you could take them to a heated indoor pool. A friend <br/>\nmentioned that a Holiday Inn near us (in Newcastle, so I don&#39;t know if <br/>\nyou can do this in the U.S.) lets you use their pool and jacuzzi for 5 <br/>\npounds a person, or something, maybe you could go there. Or maybe you <br/>\ncould book a night at a local hotel and stay over, watching new <br/>\ntelevision and swimming in the pool and enjoying the continental<br/>\nbreakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuice boxes, buy more. Buy more when you go shopping so that they have <br/>\nlots and lots to drink. If you can&#39;t afford to buy more, than make that <br/>\nsomething that you talk about. Have them help you figure out what to buy<br/>\n<br/>\nat the grocery store. If they choose to splurge on the exciting new <br/>\nfoods you just got from the grocery store, that is pretty normal. All <br/>\nthe good fruit goes really quickly around here. And fresh bread is <br/>\nalways more appealing than day old bread. And when it is gone you can <br/>\nwrite it on the list for the next grocery run. At some point the thing <br/>\nthat was an exciting splurge will change. Chips last far longer than <br/>\nstrawberries around here. Chips are common, strawberries, good spring <br/>\nstrawberries, are rare, and so get eaten very, very quickly. Artichokes <br/>\nand edamame and good apple juice and soy milk at the moment are things <br/>\nthat disappear, but we have a box filled with tic tacs (cinnamon which <br/>\nI&#39;ve only found in one place here, so we bought the store out) and <br/>\nstarbursts and hohos (cadbury mini rolls really) and gum and coke bottle<br/>\n<br/>\ncandy and wine gums and a bunch of other stuff that has been there for <br/>\nat least a month and that I&#39;ll have to go through soon to throw out what<br/>\n<br/>\nis stale or melted or gross. Phish food ice cream goes pretty quickly, <br/>\nbut the Fossil Fuel just hasn&#39;t moved. But it takes a while to trust <br/>\nthat what you like will be there when you want it. And if you have <br/>\nequated being good with getting a certain treat, like juice boxes or a <br/>\ncandy bar, than those things taste of more than just a candy bar or a <br/>\njuice box. And it may take a while for that unintentional raise in value<br/>\n<br/>\nto dissipate, for food to taste like food instead of like praise or <br/>\npunishment. Linnaea is right now, this very minute, playing with her <br/>\nfriend for whom chocolate is the most amazing food. She isn&#39;t allowed <br/>\nfree access to chocolate. So when she comes over we stock up, and <br/>\nLinnaea, for whom right now, this very minute, fitting in is very <br/>\nimportant, will try and mirror her consumption of chocolate. But she <br/>\ncan&#39;t. She just doesn&#39;t need it in the same way as her friend needs it. <br/>\nSo, she eats what she can and then gets to share what she couldn&#39;t and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, though, the first thing I would look at if I were in your shoes<br/>\n<br/>\nis how much being pregnant has made you weary. I would think about how <br/>\nbig and how heavy I felt and how feeling that way might be coloring my <br/>\nvision of the rest of the world. Being pregnant is hard work, and its <br/>\nconstant and it doesn&#39;t help you to sleep at night. Try and give <br/>\nyourself permission to let go of housework and other things right now. <br/>\nTry and take the time to breathe and relax and not feel everything <br/>\nmounting around you in some sort of Sarah Sylvia Cynthia Stout who would<br/>\n<br/>\nnot take the garbage out kind of way <br/>\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mste.uiuc.edu/courses/ci407su01/students/north/kristy/Projec\">http://www.mste.uiuc.edu/courses/ci407su01/students/north/kristy/Projec</a><br/>\nt/K-Poem-Net.html). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>SPONSORED LINKS <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Unschooling&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attac\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Unschooling&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attac</a><br/>\nhment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+parenting&c<br/>\n=5&s=104&.sig=O82AQhD_DXKdsA55u0IORA&gt;  <br/>\nAttachment<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Attachment+parenting&w1=Unschooling\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Attachment+parenting&w1=Unschooling</a><br/>\n&w2=Attachment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+pa<br/>\nrenting&c=5&s=104&.sig=mWlG37faHBsTH26WLfJbUw&gt;  parenting <br/>\nJohn<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=John+holt&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attachm\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=John+holt&w1=Unschooling&w2=Attachm</a><br/>\nent+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+parenting&c=5<br/>\n&s=104&.sig=aXLviSaeQBQ0Koa1fFBC0w&gt;  holt <br/>\n<br/>\nParenting<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Parenting+magazine&w1=Unschooling&w\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Parenting+magazine&w1=Unschooling&w</a><br/>\n2=Attachment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+pare<br/>\nnting&c=5&s=104&.sig=1vVhu6yG9zKP6tD21Ys9qw&gt;  magazine <br/>\nSingle<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Single+parenting&w1=Unschooling&w2=\">http://groups.yahoo.com/gads?t=ms&k=Single+parenting&w1=Unschooling&w2=</a><br/>\nAttachment+parenting&w3=John+holt&w4=Parenting+magazine&w5=Single+parent<br/>\ning&c=5&s=104&.sig=86a8STGJlXAgNag9XEqGWA&gt;  parenting <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!

I <br/>\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t like to get hit with a baseball accidentally, pregnant or <br/>\n&gt; not, but I&#39;m not going to sequester myself from my son&#39;s activities <br/>\n&gt; just in case.  What kind of life would that be?!  For that matter, I <br/>\n&gt; should give up driving the car in case I get into an accident, stop <br/>\n&gt; walking up and down the stairs in case I fall, stop cooking in case I <br/>\n&gt; burn myself, stop ... well, you get the idea.  I refuse to live my <br/>\n&gt; life based on fear of what *could* happen.  Or, based on lack and <br/>\n&gt; limitation.  I don&#39;t want my son to, either.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be facetious (I *am* facetious!). :-)  I&#39;m really <br/>\n&gt; trying to help you see how you may be operating from a place of fear <br/>\n&gt; rather than a place of joy.  Joy is way better than fear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But, you have to be willing to look at yourself and see where your <br/>\n&gt; fear is.  And then, push through it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; For my whole life before my son was born I had a morbid, intense fear <br/>\n&gt; of spiders.  (In fact, as a little kid I was afraid of nearly <br/>\n&gt; everything:  dogs, cats, birds, butterflies, bees, and even feathers <br/>\n&gt; for a while.  All those fears gradually fell away as I got older, but <br/>\n&gt; the spider fear hung on.  **I guess the fear served me well.**)   It <br/>\n&gt; was intense, and even into my 30s, if I saw a little spider on the <br/>\n&gt; wall way across the room, I would freak out and I would need to have <br/>\n&gt; someone &quot;get rid of it&quot; for me (it was like I was taking a contract <br/>\n&gt; out on the poor guy, whose only crime was looking like a spider.  I <br/>\n&gt; had lots of guilt around that!).  Then, our son was born, and we <br/>\n&gt; moved into a little cottage in the woods.  Lots of spiders.  Big, big <br/>\n&gt; ones.  I began to see that fear as a luxury I couldn&#39;t afford.  I <br/>\n&gt; thought that if I was irrationally afraid of spiders, Liam could <br/>\n&gt; catch my fear like a virus!  So, I stopped.  Each time I saw a spider <br/>\n&gt; I made the conscious choice to allow my fear to move through me and <br/>\n&gt; leave.  Whenever we saw spiders or anything (I really was not that <br/>\n&gt; afraid of anything else, just spiders), like snakes or bees or some <br/>\n&gt; other creepy-crawly, we would both quietly observe it.  And, I got to <br/>\n&gt; the point where I could trap a big spider (without fear) and just <br/>\n&gt; escort the guy out of the house and into the woods.  Liam does have <br/>\n&gt; some small trepidation about spiders and bees, but nothing like what <br/>\n&gt; I had as a kid.  And, because we&#39;re together a lot, I have to <br/>\n&gt; opportunity to help him calm himself about it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I just wanted to be sure that he could see an adult living a life <br/>\n&gt; that was not based on fear.  But, I also really wanted to be a person <br/>\n&gt; who does not operate out of fear.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Be well,<br/>\n&gt; Marji<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re absolutely right. I have a lot of fears, a lot of insecurities,<br/>\nand i&#39;m very sensitive right now. I am afraid my child will be cold in<br/>\nhe gets in the pool, afraid he will get cut if he climbs on the fence,<br/>\nand afraid of not making the right choices as a parent. You guys<br/>\nsharing your personal experiences and suggestions with me is<br/>\nbenefiting me greatly in learning to let go of fears and think<br/>\ndifferntly. For instance, i saw that they choose not to get in the<br/>\npool and played with water balloons instead stopping to come get<br/>\nwrapped in a towel when they were cold. I saw that my four year old<br/>\nclimbed on the fence over and over and didn&#39;t cut himself. And<br/>\nalthough he had three juice boxes in a row the first day he only asked<br/>\nfor one yesterday. I had a talk with dh last night about it. My son is<br/>\nno more likely to cut himself on the fence than to cut himself or<br/>\nbreak an arm for that matter, falling out of a tree, off his bike, or<br/>\noff of a tramoline. But i don&#39;t tell him not to climb trees or ride<br/>\nhis bike. My worries about his safety are still the same, but i cope<br/>\nwith them internally and watch him do what he has fun doing. I need to<br/>\nlearn to handle the things that have been less excepted in my mind the<br/>\nsame way. It&#39;s just hard to see at first that things you previously<br/>\nthought were good parenting techniques in fact are not. From my<br/>\nprevious point of view i would be being a neglectful mother to let my<br/>\nchildren do things i thought i knew better about. This is because i<br/>\ndon&#39;t want my children to suffer. It&#39;s taking time to see that they<br/>\nmay be suffering more because of the limitations i put on their lives<br/>\nto help me cope with my own fears. There are still just a lot of<br/>\nthings about this that seem confusing to me, and i feel it doesn&#39;t<br/>\nhelp when one person will just post over and over again that my kids<br/>\nneed me more. I realize they need me more. What i need help with is<br/>\nunderstanding how to do that and make it workable in life. I feel that<br/>\nsometimes Sandra cuts down my questioning, and lack of understanding<br/>\nas though the answer is so straightforward and simple. Okay, they need<br/>\nme more, i get that point. But sometimes the answers seem to<br/>\ncontradict each other. For instance, how does a woman manage to turn<br/>\noff the cooking and go play when she has seven kids that may all want<br/>\nsomething differnt for dinner? Not that i have seven children myself,<br/>\nbut i do have two and dh to make dinner for at night, and i can see<br/>\nhow solutions like pop some frozen dinners in the oven is a workable<br/>\nsolution for me, for certain times, but what if everyone is crying at<br/>\nyou that they all want something different, they are hungry now, and<br/>\nthey don&#39;t want to let you alone long enough to make it. I can&#39;t<br/>\nimagine how an amazing lady with seven kids manages. It&#39;s not that i<br/>\njust don&#39;t want to accept the answers, it&#39;s just that i am confused,<br/>\nand afraid of how it will actually work out in practice. This is new<br/>\nand strange to me and i feel that i benefit more from others sharing<br/>\nhow they manage to do it than being told my children need me more. I&#39;m<br/>\nalready trying to be here for them more and in new ways. I do greatly<br/>\naprreciate ALL of the suggestions EVERYONE has made so far that relate<br/>\nto helping me figure out how to change. I already realize i need to<br/>\nchange, that&#39;s not the part i need help with. I do think you&#39;ve put a<br/>\nfinger on a large part of it for me.

I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t like to get hit with a baseball accidentally, pregnant or <br/>\nnot, but I&#39;m not going to sequester myself from my son&#39;s activities <br/>\njust in case.  What kind of life would that be?!  For that matter, I <br/>\nshould give up driving the car in case I get into an accident, stop <br/>\nwalking up and down the stairs in case I fall, stop cooking in case I <br/>\nburn myself, stop ... well, you get the idea.  I refuse to live my <br/>\nlife based on fear of what *could* happen.  Or, based on lack and <br/>\nlimitation.  I don&#39;t want my son to, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be facetious (I *am* facetious!). :-)  I&#39;m really <br/>\ntrying to help you see how you may be operating from a place of fear <br/>\nrather than a place of joy.  Joy is way better than fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, you have to be willing to look at yourself and see where your <br/>\nfear is.  And then, push through it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my whole life before my son was born I had a morbid, intense fear <br/>\nof spiders.  (In fact, as a little kid I was afraid of nearly <br/>\neverything:  dogs, cats, birds, butterflies, bees, and even feathers <br/>\nfor a while.  All those fears gradually fell away as I got older, but <br/>\nthe spider fear hung on.  **I guess the fear served me well.**)   It <br/>\nwas intense, and even into my 30s, if I saw a little spider on the <br/>\nwall way across the room, I would freak out and I would need to have <br/>\nsomeone &quot;get rid of it&quot; for me (it was like I was taking a contract <br/>\nout on the poor guy, whose only crime was looking like a spider.  I <br/>\nhad lots of guilt around that!).  Then, our son was born, and we <br/>\nmoved into a little cottage in the woods.  Lots of spiders.  Big, big <br/>\nones.  I began to see that fear as a luxury I couldn&#39;t afford.  I <br/>\nthought that if I was irrationally afraid of spiders, Liam could <br/>\ncatch my fear like a virus!  So, I stopped.  Each time I saw a spider <br/>\nI made the conscious choice to allow my fear to move through me and <br/>\nleave.  Whenever we saw spiders or anything (I really was not that <br/>\nafraid of anything else, just spiders), like snakes or bees or some <br/>\nother creepy-crawly, we would both quietly observe it.  And, I got to <br/>\nthe point where I could trap a big spider (without fear) and just <br/>\nescort the guy out of the house and into the woods.  Liam does have <br/>\nsome small trepidation about spiders and bees, but nothing like what <br/>\nI had as a kid.  And, because we&#39;re together a lot, I have to <br/>\nopportunity to help him calm himself about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to be sure that he could see an adult living a life <br/>\nthat was not based on fear.  But, I also really wanted to be a person <br/>\nwho does not operate out of fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe well,<br/>\nMarji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: putting my feet in the water","postDate":"1144845065","msgId":25130,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNDdBMTMzLUY4MzItNDFFOC1BNTlFLUFDMEI4Q0M0RUZEQ0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGUxaHBwaCs3MXJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGUxaHBwaCs3MXJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":25129,"nextInTopic":25131,"prevInTime":25129,"nextInTime":25131,"topicId":25102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In some  <br/>\n&gt; places they go between natural hot springs, or saunas, and ice-cold  <br/>\n&gt; water.  It&#39;s not so crazy to just want to play in a pool that would  <br/>\n&gt; be too cold for you.  Maybe they&#39;ll just want to get in a little bit  <br/>\n&gt; and get right back out.  Would you feel the need to talk to them  <br/>\n&gt; about it  if they did, and say &quot;I told you so?&quot;  If you could say  <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Okay,&quot; and then &quot;Was it fun?&quot; when they get back, that would be  <br/>\n&gt; nice.  Kids play in the snow, and then they come in to sit by a fire  <br/>\n&gt; and drink hot chocolate.  If you think it will be too cold for them,  <br/>\n&gt; maybe you could have towels to wrap up in and a nice DVD to watch  <br/>\n&gt; while they get warm.

You  <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t expect kids to know what you know.  Years ago, Kirby broke the  <br/>\n&gt; hardwood pointer that was my souvenir of being a teacher. I used it  <br/>\n&gt; as a prop the first time I ever spoke at a conference.   He didn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; know it was any more important than any old dowel or stick around the  <br/>\n&gt; house.  I cried and he felt bad.  I didn&#39;t punish him.  It wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; have brought the stick back, and it wouldn&#39;t have made him care more  <br/>\n&gt; about me or my things.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>\n&gt; the past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think you&#39;re leaving them to take care of each other too much.   <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling will work well if you do things with them, lots, or with  <br/>\n&gt; one of them, or with all of your kids.  And fewer things will get  <br/>\n&gt; broken if you&#39;re there and they have something better to do.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-That&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every  <br/>\n&gt; time i<br/>\n&gt; clean their room.-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do you throw away things that aren&#39;t broken?

No, i wouldn&#39;t hope they got cold. That&#39;s ridiculous to assume.<br/>\nNot wanting them to be cold would be my reasoning for not wanting them<br/>\nin the pool in the first place. I just really don&#39;t appreciate that<br/>\ntype of response. I have been staying home since my first son was<br/>\nborn, and i have been an attentive parent.

I don&#39;t think letting<br/>\nmyself get hit in the stomache with a baseball or bat by accident<br/>\nwould be a good idea either. I really wish you could just keep harsh<br/>\nassumptions to yourself.

If she said &quot;You&#39;ll get sick&quot; and I didn&#39;t, she  <br/>\nwas pretty grumpy.  She WANTED me to suffer.  She wanted to be right,  <br/>\nbut her assertions and theories were extreme and wrong and mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuys swim in ice-cold water in some parts of the world.  In some  <br/>\nplaces they go between natural hot springs, or saunas, and ice-cold  <br/>\nwater.  It&#39;s not so crazy to just want to play in a pool that would  <br/>\nbe too cold for you.  Maybe they&#39;ll just want to get in a little bit  <br/>\nand get right back out.  Would you feel the need to talk to them  <br/>\nabout it  if they did, and say &quot;I told you so?&quot;  If you could say  <br/>\n&quot;Okay,&quot; and then &quot;Was it fun?&quot; when they get back, that would be  <br/>\nnice.  Kids play in the snow, and then they come in to sit by a fire  <br/>\nand drink hot chocolate.  If you think it will be too cold for them,  <br/>\nmaybe you could have towels to wrap up in and a nice DVD to watch  <br/>\nwhile they get warm.  That wouldn&#39;t be too much work, but might seem  <br/>\nlike a party to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Also what do you do about them respecting YOUR things? They<br/>\nplay with my stuff, and jump on my bed, climb on the car, and get into<br/>\nmy husband&#39;s tools. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I did was respect my children and their things from before they  <br/>\ncould remember, so they&#39;ve been pretty good about my things.  You  <br/>\ncan&#39;t expect kids to know what you know.  Years ago, Kirby broke the  <br/>\nhardwood pointer that was my souvenir of being a teacher. I used it  <br/>\nas a prop the first time I ever spoke at a conference.   He didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow it was any more important than any old dowel or stick around the  <br/>\nhouse.  I cried and he felt bad.  I didn&#39;t punish him.  It wouldn&#39;t  <br/>\nhave brought the stick back, and it wouldn&#39;t have made him care more  <br/>\nabout me or my things.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>\nthe past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re leaving them to take care of each other too much.   <br/>\nUnschooling will work well if you do things with them, lots, or with  <br/>\none of them, or with all of your kids.  And fewer things will get  <br/>\nbroken if you&#39;re there and they have something better to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-That&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every  <br/>\ntime i<br/>\nclean their room.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you throw away things that aren&#39;t broken?

You sound so tired. You write of <br/>\nbeing afraid of what will happen if you step away from timeouts and <br/>\ncountdowns to spankings. You write THEIRS in shouting capitals and write <br/>\ni in lower case tiny letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou sound so tired and so angry. When I was pregnant with Linnaea, my <br/>\nsecond child, I was tired. I was grouchy. I didn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>\npatience. I was working part time when I was pregnant which felt like <br/>\nthe only time when I got a break. And I felt horribly guilty for <br/>\nenjoying the break. For enjoying being able to go over to the cafeteria <br/>\non the Fridays when I went into the VA and get a coke and just sit at my <br/>\ncomputer and work without any distractions. It was lovely to be all on <br/>\nmy own. I&#39;ve never really felt that way at any other time. I&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>\nthe luxury of walking quickly to the shops or of not having to be <br/>\nslightly vigilantly aware of where everyone is when going somewhere <br/>\nelse, but I enjoyed the &quot;just me time&quot; when I was pregnant with Linnaea <br/>\nmore than I ever have before or since. I&#39;m not suggesting that you need <br/>\n&quot;me time&quot; with your pregnancy in the same way that I did, but maybe you <br/>\nare tired. Maybe, as this parasitic growth inside you gets closer and <br/>\ncloser to birth, and is taking more and more from you to support her <br/>\nlife, you have less to give to your other dependents. Maybe you need to <br/>\nschedule in your day pick me ups, little energy boosts of a banana <br/>\nmilkshake or an energy bar or 10 minutes of you and a cup of tea and <br/>\nsome cookies. Maybe you need to think about what really needs to get <br/>\ndone in a day. Maybe you could fix a bunch of freezable meals when your <br/>\nhusband is around that you could just pop in the oven or microwave for <br/>\nthe days when he isn&#39;t around, so that you don&#39;t have to choose between <br/>\nbeing with your children and standing at the stove. Maybe you could get <br/>\na crock pot and cook dinner all day and not have to spend a particular <br/>\ntime stuck to the stove. Maybe if you have to cook you could set up <br/>\nsomething for the boys to do while you are cooking, a video or a game or <br/>\ntime on the computer or something that would keep them entertained so <br/>\nthat you don&#39;t have to feel pulled in to many directions. Maybe you <br/>\ncould order pizza on the nights when you just can&#39;t cope anymore. Or buy <br/>\na few frozen ones to have as back up for when baseball was too <br/>\ndistracting to keep you standing at the stove.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what you &quot;have&quot; to do. I don&#39;t know what things in your <br/>\nhouse are piling up from one day to the next. If I don&#39;t get done what I <br/>\nwant to on one day it doesn&#39;t feel that bad to address it the next. Are <br/>\nthere ways that you can make your required labor less intense. Buy some <br/>\nboxes on wheels to toss toys into when you need to clean up the living <br/>\nroom. Soak dishes overnight and do the dishes in the morning. Try and <br/>\nminimize how much you feel you need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t good that they are breaking windows or that they are breaking <br/>\nthings that are yours. Maybe if you give them something they can play <br/>\nwith in the house when they are trying to use something that will break <br/>\nor will break other things they won&#39;t respond so angrily. Simon just got <br/>\nan indoor frisbee &quot;called a Superang&quot; for his birthday. Pillows are <br/>\nusually pretty good, oh, Simon discovered a while ago that a tam, little <br/>\nround knitted hat that lies flat when it isn&#39;t worn, makes a great <br/>\nindoor frisbee. You could talk to them about why it isn&#39;t okay to play <br/>\nwith certain things in the house. Simon got this cool electronic circuit <br/>\nbuilding set for Christmas that has, among other things, a spinning disc <br/>\nthat you build a launcher for. One of the paintings in our house got <br/>\nchipped by the disc, and so it isn&#39;t something that we use in the living <br/>\nroom unless I&#39;ve draped a blanket over the painting.  If something is <br/>\nimportant to you that it not be broken you might want to make sure that <br/>\nit isn&#39;t accessible. If they want to go in the pool when you think it is <br/>\ntoo cold, get lots of towels and be prepared to warm them up, make some <br/>\nhot chocolate or give them a nice warm bath or shower when they are <br/>\ndone. Maybe you could take them to a heated indoor pool. A friend <br/>\nmentioned that a Holiday Inn near us (in Newcastle, so I don&#39;t know if <br/>\nyou can do this in the U.S.) lets you use their pool and jacuzzi for 5 <br/>\npounds a person, or something, maybe you could go there. Or maybe you <br/>\ncould book a night at a local hotel and stay over, watching new <br/>\ntelevision and swimming in the pool and enjoying the continental breakfast.<br/>\n<br/>\nJuice boxes, buy more. Buy more when you go shopping so that they have <br/>\nlots and lots to drink. If you can&#39;t afford to buy more, than make that <br/>\nsomething that you talk about. Have them help you figure out what to buy <br/>\nat the grocery store. If they choose to splurge on the exciting new <br/>\nfoods you just got from the grocery store, that is pretty normal. All <br/>\nthe good fruit goes really quickly around here. And fresh bread is <br/>\nalways more appealing than day old bread. And when it is gone you can <br/>\nwrite it on the list for the next grocery run. At some point the thing <br/>\nthat was an exciting splurge will change. Chips last far longer than <br/>\nstrawberries around here. Chips are common, strawberries, good spring <br/>\nstrawberries, are rare, and so get eaten very, very quickly. Artichokes <br/>\nand edamame and good apple juice and soy milk at the moment are things <br/>\nthat disappear, but we have a box filled with tic tacs (cinnamon which <br/>\nI&#39;ve only found in one place here, so we bought the store out) and <br/>\nstarbursts and hohos (cadbury mini rolls really) and gum and coke bottle <br/>\ncandy and wine gums and a bunch of other stuff that has been there for <br/>\nat least a month and that I&#39;ll have to go through soon to throw out what <br/>\nis stale or melted or gross. Phish food ice cream goes pretty quickly, <br/>\nbut the Fossil Fuel just hasn&#39;t moved. But it takes a while to trust <br/>\nthat what you like will be there when you want it. And if you have <br/>\nequated being good with getting a certain treat, like juice boxes or a <br/>\ncandy bar, than those things taste of more than just a candy bar or a <br/>\njuice box. And it may take a while for that unintentional raise in value <br/>\nto dissipate, for food to taste like food instead of like praise or <br/>\npunishment. Linnaea is right now, this very minute, playing with her <br/>\nfriend for whom chocolate is the most amazing food. She isn&#39;t allowed <br/>\nfree access to chocolate. So when she comes over we stock up, and <br/>\nLinnaea, for whom right now, this very minute, fitting in is very <br/>\nimportant, will try and mirror her consumption of chocolate. But she <br/>\ncan&#39;t. She just doesn&#39;t need it in the same way as her friend needs it. <br/>\nSo, she eats what she can and then gets to share what she couldn&#39;t and <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, though, the first thing I would look at if I were in your shoes <br/>\nis how much being pregnant has made you weary. I would think about how <br/>\nbig and how heavy I felt and how feeling that way might be coloring my <br/>\nvision of the rest of the world. Being pregnant is hard work, and its <br/>\nconstant and it doesn&#39;t help you to sleep at night.

It might sound more like a helpful <br/>\nsuggestion to them if you included yourself in the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well why don&#39;t you go play baseball with them?&quot; I<br/>\n&gt;suppose that&#39;s possible some of the time, but solutions like that<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t workable in reality 100% of the time. I&#39;m currently nine months<br/>\n&gt;pregnant, and can&#39;t leave food on the stove cooking, for instance, to<br/>\n&gt;go play baseball.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True, but you can turn off the stove and go outside with them if they <br/>\nreally need you.  Baseball playing is probably not the thing for you <br/>\nto do right now, but since it&#39;s apparent that they really want you to <br/>\nbe with them, all you have to do is be there.  With them.  Talking <br/>\nand listening and laughing and being your wonderful self who they really love!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;(My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>\n&gt;know i&#39;m busy with something hard to walk away from like cooking or an<br/>\n&gt;important phone call.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They&#39;re trying really hard to get your attention.

I felt i NEEDED to tell him not to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Give him information (in a loving, supportive way) that he can use to <br/>\nmake a good decision about climbing the fence.  See if there&#39;s a way <br/>\nyou can help him do what he wants to do rather than just telling him <br/>\nhe can&#39;t.  If you can give him information in the right, supportive <br/>\nway, he&#39;ll reach the conclusion that works best for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Or what if they want to drink the whole container of juice boxes in<br/>\n&gt;one day and you know they will cry for the rest of the week that there<br/>\n&gt;aren&#39;t anymore?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again, give him the information.  And, if he decides to drink all the <br/>\njuice boxes and then is sad that they&#39;re all gone, comfort him, the <br/>\nway you would any friend who was sad.  Don&#39;t rub salt into the wound <br/>\nor say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;  He&#39;ll get it.  Or, just make sure you get <br/>\nenough juice boxes for the week and don&#39;t keep them all out where <br/>\nthey can be seen and consumed right away!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Or what if they want to eat the things i buy<br/>\n&gt;specically for my husband&#39;s lunches at work?(I do buy them their own<br/>\n&gt;treats.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Find a way to keep these things out of their sight if you don&#39;t want <br/>\nthem to eat them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;If they want to play in the pool, but you know it&#39;s not warm<br/>\n&gt;enough outside should you just let them do it anyway, and hope they<br/>\n&gt;learn from it when they are cold?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I have a different perception of the temperature than my son <br/>\ndoes.  When I&#39;m cold, he&#39;s really not.  I would not make him wear a <br/>\njacket when he&#39;s not cold, and I would hope he wouldn&#39;t prevent me <br/>\nfrom wearing a jacket if I were cold.  So, if they want to play in <br/>\nthe pool and it&#39;s too cold for you, let them reach the decision based <br/>\non their comfort.  &#39;Cause if you prevent them from doing it, they&#39;ll <br/>\nwant to do it all the more regardless of their personal comfort or safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;This is going to be so hard for me<br/>\n&gt;to learn.

The one or two that I do leave out are fair game.  If there&#39;s <br/>\nstuff that you have that would make you sad if it got broken, <br/>\nconsider putting it away for a while until your kids are older and <br/>\ncan be more respectful of your things.  If you can do this in a <br/>\nloving, mindful way, you won&#39;t feel so resentful of having to do without.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We have had a<br/>\n&gt;rule that if it&#39;s not yours don&#39;t play with it. I don&#39;t know what to<br/>\n&gt;do about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Rules again!  What do they really mean to a little one?!  Get your <br/>\nstuff out of harm&#39;s way.  And, consider rearranging your home so that <br/>\nit&#39;s less convenient for them to run, if you don&#39;t want them running <br/>\nin the living room, say.  Replace all the breakable stuff with <br/>\nunbreakable stuff (for now), and realize that you&#39;re sharing your <br/>\nhome with little folks who need the place to be more kid-friendly <br/>\nthan it is right now.  That will relieve a lot of the tension your having.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;So if you all haven&#39;t given up on me because of my<br/>\n&gt;negativity yet please help me figure some of this out.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re willing to hang in there.

It sounds  <br/>\nexhausting, but it is your job, and after a while, they won&#39;t need  <br/>\nyou as much because they will trust that you&#39;ll be there when they  <br/>\nneed you. And soon they will grow up and not be so intense. You don&#39;t  <br/>\nhave to play hard, but sometimes your presence to validate them is  <br/>\nall they need. Sitting in a lawn chair and saying &quot;WOw! You can run  <br/>\nreally fast&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could throw the ball so high&quot;, or  <br/>\nplay as long as you can and say in an exaggerated manner, &quot;Sheesh!  <br/>\nYou guys have a lot of energy...mommy needs to sit down and rest the  <br/>\nbaby&quot; That&#39;s what I usually wind up doing (and I&#39;m pregnant a LOT  <br/>\nlol!) But then I&#39;m sitting there and being involved.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well why don&#39;t you go play baseball with them?&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; suppose that&#39;s possible some of the time, but solutions like that<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t workable in reality 100% of the time. I&#39;m currently nine months<br/>\n&gt; pregnant, and can&#39;t leave food on the stove cooking, for instance, to<br/>\n&gt; go play baseball.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to turn the food off to play with your kids, it&#39;s easy to  <br/>\nmake foods that you don&#39;t have to attend to, you just have to make  <br/>\nthe choice to do it. I have seven kids, one of whom has a severe  <br/>\ndisability, several of whom have moderate issues, and two of whom  <br/>\nhave serious food allergies. If I can do it pregnant...so can you.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just a matter of turning off the &#39;what if&#39;s?&#39; and choosing to  <br/>\nlive this life and be happy doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; (My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>\n&gt; know i&#39;m busy with something hard to walk away from like cooking or an<br/>\n&gt; important phone call.)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Because they know it&#39;s the best way to get your attention!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I also have so much to do preparing for the new<br/>\n&gt; baby<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Babies don&#39;t need anything but mom and love. Maybe diapers, but not  <br/>\nall moms do that. They don&#39;t need a crib, they don&#39;t need toys, they  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need a fresh coat of paint. Take this time when you can&#39;t be  <br/>\ndoing everything to choose to spend time with your kids. It will make  <br/>\nall the difference. I just did this myself, and came fully to  <br/>\nunschooling when i was on three months bedrest with my last baby. It  <br/>\nwas awesome to let all that stuff go!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; that can be and is put off to do things with them sometimes, but<br/>\n&gt; it can&#39;t always be that way. Yesterday, for instance, we played out<br/>\n&gt; back with water bombs and water guns all afternoon instead of me doing<br/>\n&gt; the things i know i need to get done and now i&#39;ll have a heavier load<br/>\n&gt; today.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What heavier load? Laundry is laundry, dishes is dishes, dust is  <br/>\ndust. It will always be there, but your kids won&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; What do you do when your four year old wants to climb on the fence and<br/>\n&gt; it is sharp at the top?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Let him do it. Trust that he has the brains to know when he&#39;s gone  <br/>\ntoo far and be willing to help him out without scolding or saying &#39;I  <br/>\ntold you so&#39;. Encourage him. Don&#39;t yell because it throws him off  <br/>\nbalance and the worst thing you could do is undermine his self esteem  <br/>\nby fretting.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Or what if they want to drink the whole container of juice boxes in<br/>\n&gt; one day and you know they will cry for the rest of the week that there<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t anymore?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Get more. Or offer something else cool to drink. Chocolate milk.  <br/>\nHomemade lemonade. Water with ice cubes that have plastic bugs frozen  <br/>\nin them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Or what if they want to eat the things i buy<br/>\n&gt; specically for my husband&#39;s lunches at work?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Get them the same stuff you buy dh. Or pack theirs up like you pack  <br/>\nhis. Or make something new and different for lunch. edible playdough,  <br/>\npizza rolls, pigs in a blanket, sandwiches cut into shapes. Picnic  <br/>\noutside.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; )If they want to play in the pool, but you know it&#39;s not warm<br/>\n&gt; enough outside should you just let them do it anyway, and hope they<br/>\n&gt; learn from it when they are cold?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yep. They will play in it for about ten minutes. Or they might  <br/>\nsurprise you and play longer because to them it DOESN&quot;T feel that  <br/>\ncold. Or they might stand on the side and splash or get cups of water  <br/>\nto make mud. have big warm blankets to snuggle them in when they do  <br/>\nget cold. and hot cocoa is always nice ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Also what do you do about them respecting YOUR things? They<br/>\n&gt; play with my stuff, and jump on my bed, climb on the car, and get into<br/>\n&gt; my husband&#39;s tools.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I ask the kids to treat my things with respect. I redirect. I ask  <br/>\nthem again. I redirect. I ask them again. I redirect. Sounds simple,  <br/>\nbut if they are jumping on the bed, it&#39;s either because they need  <br/>\nthat input or that they need my attention. They aren&#39;t jumping on it  <br/>\njust to destroy it. Now, if you made a big deal about how they will  <br/>\ndestroy it, and that&#39;s the attention they get, it might turn into  <br/>\nthat. And some kids just need longer to learn than others. My kids  <br/>\nhave their own tools. They climb on the walls outside. They jump on  <br/>\ntheir own beds, and sometimes they jump on mine. Sometimes *I* jump  <br/>\non mine. It&#39;s fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; By the way, i did not exaggerate about things<br/>\n&gt; getting broken. My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>\n&gt; the past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve lost a ceiling fan, a sliding glass door and two screens. It  <br/>\nwas accidental each time, they just wanted to see what happened and  <br/>\nnow they now. They didn&#39;t get a lecture about breaking things or  <br/>\ndestroying things, so that&#39;s not their focus. They&#39;ve learned that  <br/>\nthey can ask me for help. The fan was the funniest thing, because  <br/>\nthey thought they could swing around like cartoon characters do.  <br/>\nWell, they didn&#39;t ;-) I&#39;m just thankful they didn&#39;t break their necks  <br/>\nor pull the whole thing out of the ceiling on their heads.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; That&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every time i<br/>\n&gt; clean their room. It&#39;s not that things MIGHT get broken at my house.<br/>\n&gt; Things DO get broken.<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Kids have lots of energy. They need to have lots of mommy too. Some  <br/>\nkids need more sensory input than others and they have to play as  <br/>\nhard as possible just to feel real. The alternative is to have a  <br/>\nspacey kid who is a vegetable. Meds can do that for you. We do lots  <br/>\nof heavy work, we dig holes to china. we dig tigger traps. we build  <br/>\nstuff (lots of hammering and sawing). we jump alot, we climb alot of  <br/>\ntrees.<br/>\nI know you&#39;re tired. i feel that you are uncertain of where you are  <br/>\ngoing. I was there not so long ago. I&#39;m still there sometimes. But we  <br/>\nhave a job as parents to make better choices, to know where we are  <br/>\ngoing. You CAN do this, and you took the first step by admitting you  <br/>\nneed help to get there. Make the choice now to keep going. To trust  <br/>\nin your kids and support them, the same way you did when you married  <br/>\nyour husband...<br/>\nhope this is okay</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":211613748,"authorName":"lilith_pouia","from":"&quot;lilith_pouia&quot; &lt;lilith_pouia@...&gt;","profile":"lilith_pouia","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: putting my feet in the water","postDate":"1144779721","msgId":25109,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGUxZ3M0OSt2MW9zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJiNDE2NmMyOTNjZTQzMzAyZjM1NWI2MmRmMWZjYTZlQGNveC5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":25108,"nextInTopic":25112,"prevInTime":25108,"nextInTime":25110,"topicId":25102,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She really offended me by making a remark<br/>\n&gt; about me leaving my children without a mother. I can see her point<br/>\n&gt; better now after reading this, though i feel she could have stated<br/>\n&gt; things differently and less harassingly. I have tried to quit smoking<br/>\n&gt;   several times throughout the past year, and i felt she was being<br/>\n&gt; harassing as though i don&#39;t realize how important it is to quit. But i<br/>\n&gt; just wanted to share that i noticed this philosophy can be applied to<br/>\n&gt; anything we need to do to better ourselves, not just our parenting. It<br/>\n&gt; could become &quot;too late&quot; for me to quit smoking, and i think maybe<br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s all my mother was trying to explain to me.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;m just guessing here that you smoked during your other pregnancies <br/>\n&gt; as well.  Have you considered that your two boys may have physiological <br/>\n&gt; conditions that are causing their behavior?  Upon reading the details <br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve posted, I&#39;ve begun to suspect that your boys are behaving <br/>\n&gt; abnormally.  What does their pediatrician say about their behaviors?  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be mean or hurtful or judgmental, but you came to <br/>\n&gt; this list asking for help from more experienced unschoolers, and I&#39;m <br/>\n&gt; probably not the only one who&#39;s thinking along these lines.

Our study extends <br/>\n&gt; previous research onhumans by controlling a broad range of correlates <br/>\n&gt; of maternal smoking during pregnancy todetermine if smoking is <br/>\n&gt; associated with behavior problems in the offspring severe enough to <br/>\n&gt; qualifyfor DSM-III-R diagnoses. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Method: Subjects were 177 clinic-referred boys, ages 7 to 12 years at <br/>\n&gt; the time of the first assessment, who underwent longitudinal assessment <br/>\n&gt; for 6 years using annual structured diagnostic interviews. Correlates <br/>\n&gt; of maternal smoking during pregnancy and previously identified <br/>\n&gt; demographic, parental, perinatal, and family risk factors for the <br/>\n&gt; disruptive behavior disorders were controlled in logistic regression <br/>\n&gt; analyses. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Results: Mothers who smoked more than half a pack of cigarettes daily <br/>\n&gt; during pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a child with <br/>\n&gt; conduct disorder (odds ratio, 4.4; P=.001) than mothers who did not <br/>\n&gt; smoke during pregnancy. This association was statistically significant <br/>\n&gt; when controlling for socioeconomic status, maternal age, parental <br/>\n&gt; antisocial personality, substance abuse during pregnancy, and <br/>\n&gt; maladaptive parenting.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy appears to be a robust <br/>\n&gt; independent risk factor for conduct disorder in male offspring. <br/>\n&gt; Maternal smoking during pregnancy may have direct adverse effects on <br/>\n&gt; the developing fetus or be a marker for a heretofore unmeasured <br/>\n&gt; characteristic of mothers that is of etiologic significance for conduct <br/>\n&gt; disorder.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Lauren S.

I should let them learn THEIR OWN value for things like<br/>\n&gt; books and whatever else.<br/>\n&gt; The not throwing and runing in the house thing will be hard because i<br/>\n&gt; offer my kids alternatives like playing in the backyard and they<br/>\n&gt; always act as though they are being punished if i say &quot;Go outside if<br/>\n&gt; you want to wrestle, or rough house, run, throw, etc.&quot; Or i might say<br/>\n&gt; &quot;Why don&#39;t you guys go play baseball or hide and seek?&quot; But sometimes<br/>\n&gt; they just refuse my suggestions and continue being high strung<br/>\n&gt; indoors. So i have had a rule that if they won&#39;t calm down inside i<br/>\n&gt; make them go out back. They respond to this like a punishment.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s easy to say &quot;Well why don&#39;t you go play baseball with them?&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; suppose that&#39;s possible some of the time, but solutions like that<br/>\n&gt; aren&#39;t workable in reality 100% of the time. I&#39;m currently nine months<br/>\n&gt; pregnant,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It would have helped the discussion if you&#39;d mentioned this fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd from your next post:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This reminds me of a hurtful argument my mother and i had about me<br/>\nquitting smoking last week. She really offended me by making a remark<br/>\nabout me leaving my children without a mother. I can see her point<br/>\nbetter now after reading this, though i feel she could have stated<br/>\nthings differently and less harassingly. I have tried to quit smoking<br/>\n  several times throughout the past year, and i felt she was being<br/>\nharassing as though i don&#39;t realize how important it is to quit. But i<br/>\njust wanted to share that i noticed this philosophy can be applied to<br/>\nanything we need to do to better ourselves, not just our parenting. It<br/>\ncould become &quot;too late&quot; for me to quit smoking, and i think maybe<br/>\nthat&#39;s all my mother was trying to explain to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m just guessing here that you smoked during your other pregnancies <br/>\nas well.  Have you considered that your two boys may have physiological <br/>\nconditions that are causing their behavior?  Upon reading the details <br/>\nyou&#39;ve posted, I&#39;ve begun to suspect that your boys are behaving <br/>\nabnormally.  What does their pediatrician say about their behaviors?  <br/>\nI&#39;m not trying to be mean or hurtful or judgmental, but you came to <br/>\nthis list asking for help from more experienced unschoolers, and I&#39;m <br/>\nprobably not the only one who&#39;s thinking along these lines.  You may <br/>\nneed medical intervention, rather than parenting advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was from just one try googling &quot;smoking during pregnancy&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chem-tox.com/pregnancy/smoking.htm\">http://www.chem-tox.com/pregnancy/smoking.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSmoking During Pregnancy Increases Conduct Disorders<br/>\n<br/>\nSOURCE: Archives General Psychiatry, 54:670-676, July, 1997<br/>\n<br/>\nMore evidence on the connection between a mother&#39;s smoking during <br/>\npregnancy and increased risk of having a child with behavior disorders. <br/>\nBelow is a direct quote of the summary of the 1997 journal article <br/>\nreport in the Archives of General Psychiatry, 54:670, 1997.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackground: Previous animal and human studies have indicated that <br/>\nprenatal exposure to nicotine isassociated with adverse reproductive <br/>\noutcomes, including altered neural structure and functioning,cognitive <br/>\ndeficits, and behavior problems in the offspring. Our study extends <br/>\nprevious research onhumans by controlling a broad range of correlates <br/>\nof maternal smoking during pregnancy todetermine if smoking is <br/>\nassociated with behavior problems in the offspring severe enough to <br/>\nqualifyfor DSM-III-R diagnoses. <br/>\n<br/>\nMethod: Subjects were 177 clinic-referred boys, ages 7 to 12 years at <br/>\nthe time of the first assessment, who underwent longitudinal assessment <br/>\nfor 6 years using annual structured diagnostic interviews. Correlates <br/>\nof maternal smoking during pregnancy and previously identified <br/>\ndemographic, parental, perinatal, and family risk factors for the <br/>\ndisruptive behavior disorders were controlled in logistic regression <br/>\nanalyses. <br/>\n<br/>\nResults: Mothers who smoked more than half a pack of cigarettes daily <br/>\nduring pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a child with <br/>\nconduct disorder (odds ratio, 4.4; P=.001) than mothers who did not <br/>\nsmoke during pregnancy. This association was statistically significant <br/>\nwhen controlling for socioeconomic status, maternal age, parental <br/>\nantisocial personality, substance abuse during pregnancy, and <br/>\nmaladaptive parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nConclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy appears to be a robust <br/>\nindependent risk factor for conduct disorder in male offspring. <br/>\nMaternal smoking during pregnancy may have direct adverse effects on <br/>\nthe developing fetus or be a marker for a heretofore unmeasured <br/>\ncharacteristic of mothers that is of etiologic significance for conduct <br/>\ndisorder.<br/>\n<br/>\nLauren S.

I had<br/>\na good cry the other night, and have been reading more articles, and<br/>\nhad long discussions with my husband. We have decided to try the no<br/>\nmore punishment thing. I am scared though, of what might happen if it<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t work or i break down and can&#39;t handle it. I&#39;m afraid of not<br/>\nbeing consistent with my children and them resenting me more for it.<br/>\nBut maybe if i can ask questions as they come up, and as i learn more<br/>\nabout the way you all are with your families i might get the hang of<br/>\nit. I&#39;ve realized it&#39;s true that i don&#39;t have to let it upset me when<br/>\nmy kids break THEIR things, that the things become THEIRS when i give<br/>\nthem to the kids and the things have to be THEIRS for them to ever<br/>\nlearn how to care for THEIR things. And maybe i should find things to<br/>\ngive them just so they can break them if that&#39;s what they like to do.<br/>\nIt&#39;s true also that the value I put onto books is MY value, not<br/>\nTHEIRS, and shouldn&#39;t be impossed on them if i want them to learn to<br/>\nthink freely.

I&#39;m currently nine months<br/>\npregnant, and can&#39;t leave food on the stove cooking, for instance, to<br/>\ngo play baseball.(My kids like to run and yell in the house when they<br/>\nknow i&#39;m busy with something hard to walk away from like cooking or an<br/>\nimportant phone call.) I also have so much to do preparing for the new<br/>\nbaby that can be and is put off to do things with them sometimes, but<br/>\nit can&#39;t always be that way. Yesterday, for instance, we played out<br/>\nback with water bombs and water guns all afternoon instead of me doing<br/>\nthe things i know i need to get done and now i&#39;ll have a heavier load<br/>\ntoday. But, i am willing to try.<br/>\nYesterday was our first day trying not to tell the kids what to do<br/>\nconstantly, and with no punishments and i already have a billion<br/>\nquestions.<br/>\nWhat do you do when your four year old wants to climb on the fence and<br/>\nit is sharp at the top? I felt i NEEDED to tell him not to do it.<br/>\nOr what if they want to drink the whole container of juice boxes in<br/>\none day and you know they will cry for the rest of the week that there<br/>\naren&#39;t anymore? Or what if they want to eat the things i buy<br/>\nspecically for my husband&#39;s lunches at work?(I do buy them their own<br/>\ntreats.)If they want to play in the pool, but you know it&#39;s not warm<br/>\nenough outside should you just let them do it anyway, and hope they<br/>\nlearn from it when they are cold? This is going to be so hard for me<br/>\nto learn. Also what do you do about them respecting YOUR things? They<br/>\nplay with my stuff, and jump on my bed, climb on the car, and get into<br/>\nmy husband&#39;s tools. By the way, i did not exaggerate about things<br/>\ngetting broken. My children have broken three or four windows within<br/>\nthe past year, and a ceiling fan, a floor fan and a light fixture.<br/>\nThat&#39;s aside from the books, toys and videos i throw away every time i<br/>\nclean their room. It&#39;s not that things MIGHT get broken at my house.<br/>\nThings DO get broken. And alot of times it&#39;s MY things. We have had a<br/>\nrule that if it&#39;s not yours don&#39;t play with it. I don&#39;t know what to<br/>\ndo about that. So if you all haven&#39;t given up on me because of my<br/>\nnegativity yet please help me figure some of this out.<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nLilith mother of Tristan Michael(7), Danikan Amadeus(4), and soon to<br/>\nbe Jude Onyx</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25280,"nextTopicId":25233}}
