Sorry for just jumping in and blabbing my fool head off without an intro.... :-) Here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;m Rachelle...as you know we just moved from Colorado to North Idaho.  I&#39;ve been married to Shawn for almost 10 years and we have an 8 year old girl named Kennedy. I&#39;m also the proud Surrogate mama to Kayla, who just turned 5 last week (does that mean I can&#39;t blame this &quot;baby weight&quot; on her anymore!!?? ;-)  She lives in the Bay area and also part time in Hawaii with her Mom and Dad. Kayla&#39;s homeschooled, too! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Kennedy went to public school for preschool and most of kindergarten.  I pulled her out to homeschool and we&#39;ve just been having a blast ever since.  She starts 3rd grade next week.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  I pulled her out for several reasons...one of which being that I used to teach....hehehe... *that&#39;s* telling, isn&#39;t it? I know how hard teachers try to give kids the attention they need and it simply *can&#39;t* happen anymore.  Too many kids, too much red tape and paperwork, not enough help, time or money.  I also had a run-in with the admin. at her school and they proved to me that the parents&#39; opinions meant jack squat to them....so she came home with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Technically, we are not unschoolers (yet!) I hope you don&#39;t ban us! ;) I HATED school until I went to college... college is about LEARNING (gasp!), not popularity or money and all the rubbish that high school is about...and I was hooked instantly... I kept getting degree after degree and loving every second.  (and I have the student loans to prove it!) LOL...but it&#39;s OK...I feel that I am a more well rounded person than I would have been had I not done all that (of course, not that that applies to everyone...but it&#39;s MY personal path).  What college did was get the joy of sharpened #2 pencils, A pluses and chalk dust planted firmly in my heart... and so that&#39;s how I started our HSing... kind of school at home.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, as you all know....THAT DOESN&#39;T WORK VERY WELL! lol.... so while we still use curricula, I am starting to read up on unschooling and more &quot;real life&quot; learning and am anxious to start incorporating that kind of thing more into our days.  I ordered two books from Amazon on unschooling that just came last week and I look forward to reading them...and of course, learning from all of you!<br/>\n<br/>\n  So that&#39;s us.... basically, we managed to move from one conservative, right wing, heavily religious state to another, and we&#39;re kind of the *opposite* of all that....so we&#39;re a little lonely sometimes and looking forward to meeting some other HSers that might share more of our views and values.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thanks for letting me join you!<br/>\n  Rachelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5577,"nextTopicId":5543}}
