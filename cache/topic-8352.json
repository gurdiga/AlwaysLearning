I have a question and I feel<br/>\nlike a school-at-homer asking &quot;what about math?&quot; ;)  But... what<br/>\nabout fiber and vitamins?<br/>\n<br/>\n----------<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the fiber has had me stumped for quite awhile, I&#39;ll tell you (my<br/>\noldest daughter does regularly get a strong craving for huge green salads,<br/>\nso that takes care of her, I think, but my youngest seems to have no<br/>\nproblems with the inner works in her fruit-and-veggie free diet -- and I do<br/>\nvery complacently expect that to change as she ages).<br/>\n<br/>\nVitamins are easy, here: I ask them to eat a multi-vitamin every day. I<br/>\nexplain that this is a foible of mine as mommies sometimes lunge awake at<br/>\nnight worrying that their children might not grow up strong without a daily<br/>\nvitamin,  and I beg the courts, (er, I mean the children&#39;s) indulgence, and<br/>\nthey humor me (and I think they do so directly because I&#39;m not constantly<br/>\nyammering at them to eat or not eat this or that). They did flatly refuse to<br/>\neat the icky Costco brand chewables I dragged home one week &lt;g&gt; but we&#39;ve<br/>\ncompromised nicely as long as I bring home Pokemon or Flintstones.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this isn&#39;t &quot;as good as&quot; getting vitamins from real food, but it&#39;s<br/>\npainless. We do talk sometimes about what food is good for what nutritional<br/>\nreasons. If they refused the vitamin, I&#39;d drop the issue like a hot rock and<br/>\nprobably grind it up into their brownies or sprinkle it on their Bagel<br/>\nBites. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWally and I made this eating decision - we won&#39;t sacrifice for our children<br/>\ntoday&#39;s calm happiness in their eating choices against tomorrow&#39;s<br/>\npossibilities and statistically-varying maybes. I give them choices and<br/>\ntrust them, and it seems to work for us. They definitely eat more &quot;junk&quot;<br/>\nthan a nutritionally-focused family would approve of, but I also see them<br/>\nCHOOSING to eat more &quot;good food&quot; than the children in many of those<br/>\nfamilies, when said children ARE suddenly presented with &quot;choices&quot; -- as<br/>\nsomeone (Deb?) said, mine have never made themselves sick gorging on<br/>\n*anything* because they&#39;ve never had cause to think of chocolate as less<br/>\naccessible than bread.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":119302179,"authorName":"meghanfire","from":"&quot;meghanfire&quot; &lt;meghan@...&gt;","profile":"meghanfire","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Silk road class","postDate":"1029121799","msgId":8413,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGFqNzh1NytrOWhjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNENTJBNzkxLjc4QzMxQkU2QGxpbm1heC5zYW8uYXJpem9uYS5lZHU+"},"prevInTopic":8412,"nextInTopic":8414,"prevInTime":8412,"nextInTime":8414,"topicId":8352,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... me of how ... series.

But each family <br/>\nmember gets to choose one thing.  Lexie had narrowed it down from <br/>\nbrocoli, tastycakes, and something else.  I can&#39;t remember.  Janene had <br/>\noriginally picked out a package of 8 small packages of chips, but later <br/>\nI saw one that had 44 packages of chips, same brand, more variety in <br/>\nchips, for just $2 more, so we got the better buy.  We don&#39;t buy soda, <br/>\nor cookies at the store, but we do make cookies, brownies (remember, I&#39;m <br/>\ngoing to go make some now, as soon as Mark finishes the dishes), etc. <br/>\n It&#39;s not really a treat, it&#39;s just that when we go to the store to buy <br/>\nbasic stuff, the kids get to pick something I dont&#39; have a coupon for <br/>\nand isn&#39;t necessarily on sale and that we don&#39;t necessarily need, etc. <br/>\n They also picked out a few other things-ticktacks, (they were free as I <br/>\nhad a coupon for 55cents off, and the store doubles it and the price was <br/>\n55 cents each), some gogurt yogurt thing, an off brand because the name <br/>\nbrand was nearly twice as expensive as the off brand so I said they <br/>\ncould get two of the off brand or one of the name brand and they aren&#39;t <br/>\nstupid, let&#39;s see, what else did they pick.  Oh yes, the shrimp.  They <br/>\nbegged for that.  The salmon was on sale, for $3 a pound and the shrimp <br/>\nwas also on sale, for even less, so it was pretty cheap--the cherries <br/>\nthough, they were expensive, why are canned cherries so expensive!  It <br/>\nwas a good meal but we don&#39;t eat like that every day.  We also don&#39;t <br/>\ndeny kids food for expense.  For my birthday a few weeks ago we went to <br/>\nred lobster and Janene, who is four, ordered lobster and veggies.  And <br/>\nchocolate cake.  We had it all.  Lexie (7) ordered the shrimp plate off <br/>\nthe adult menu.  They don&#39;t order off the kid&#39;s menu.  What I meant by <br/>\nspending my money wisely is that I generally don&#39;t buy soda and other <br/>\nthings.  If my kids want to choose soda that&#39;s fine with me.  I do limit <br/>\ncaffeine but I do see that more as a drug and they can always have the <br/>\nnoncaffiene choices.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll never forget one day at the store. we were going to leave the next <br/>\nday for a few days and I didn&#39;t want to buy things that would go bad <br/>\nwhile we were gone.  They had cpt crunch berries on sale, my favorite, <br/>\nso we bought three boxes, one for each.  Then we got to the produce <br/>\ndept.  I was going to get apples for the car, and maybe grapes, but the <br/>\ngirls kept begging for things.  Please mom, get us carrots. Mom get us <br/>\ntomatos, please mom get us plums.  Please mom get us brocoli.  Finally I <br/>\nhear myself saying loudly &quot;you already got your treat, capt crunch <br/>\nberries, I am NOT buying you brocoli.&quot;  Got a few looks for that one.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I do do that I probably shouldn&#39;t is I ask that things like <br/>\nthe chips and tasty cakes be saved for when we go places, like the park, <br/>\netc.  Just as I ask that bottled water be saved for going to the park, <br/>\ntrips in the car, etc.  But if they eat all the chips and tasty cakes <br/>\nand stuff and there are none left for going to the park or the beach <br/>\nthen that&#39;s life.  I dont&#39; get bent out of shape over it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Money is a pain in the ass &lt;g&gt;, but if you can afford salmon and shrimp<br/>\n&gt; maybe you can afford homemade chocolate chip cookies and some nice salty<br/>\n&gt; generic chips off the bargain rack? (We stock up on the ingredients <br/>\n&gt; for lots<br/>\n&gt; of baked sweets, one by one as they&#39;re on sale).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Ype so do we.

My<br/>\nhusband noticed how Dylan would just take his plate to the sink after<br/>\ndinner, just get up and do it, without being asked.  We talked then about<br/>\nthe possibility that everything could be learned that way, by just living<br/>\nand participating and being involved.

We were such radicals! &lt;G&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it seems funny to me when I hear unschoolers assign household chores<br/>\nto their kids, because the observation about household stuff is what led<br/>\nus to wondering about all the rest.

He is very decisive<br/>\nabout exactly HOW everyone should move and who should<br/>\nsay what (Director??)  We have long discussion which<br/>\nmainly consist of answering his myriad questions.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t like going to the theater with him because he<br/>\ntalks through the entire movie, asking questions.  But<br/>\nI still take him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI help him search online for movie information, film<br/>\nwebsites, and etc.  I play movie trailers for him, and<br/>\ninterviews with the actors.  I play fanfilm parodies. <br/>\nOne of his favorites is TROOPS, which is done like<br/>\nCOPS with Storm Troopers: &quot;On location with the men of<br/>\nthe Imperial Forces.  All suspects are GUILTY! <br/>\nOtherwise they wouldn&#39;t be suspect would they?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now he is on a Lord of the Rings kick, since we<br/>\nbought the first DVD.  In November, when the special 4<br/>\ndisc edition with all the extra footage and more<br/>\nspecial features comes out, we will get that as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my younger son, we are finding all sorts of ways<br/>\nto practice letters and words, since that is what he<br/>\nis interested in.

There&#39;s an apprehension when you know how <br/>\nanother person runs things and you&#39;re going to be involved being <br/>\ntotally aware that it&#39;s not going to fit your philosophies.<br/>\nWe signed up for a snake &quot;unit study&quot; with a small group of 4 or 5 <br/>\nother families about three years ago. This was before I was totally <br/>\nunschooling, but still had those philosophies. I&#39;d say we were more <br/>\neclectic/relaxed homeschoolers.<br/>\nI msut have seemed like an unschooler to them because I wouldn&#39;t make <br/>\nmy kids do all the stuff the other kids were getting rammed down <br/>\ntheir throats.<br/>\nHow it turned out, was I let my kids take from it what they enjoyed <br/>\nand not do the rest. I didn&#39;t let them be disruptive to the other <br/>\nmembers during things they didn&#39;t want to do, but they understood.<br/>\nIt turned into this awful class style, so to counter that I just told <br/>\nmy kids to wait patiently for a fun activity and if they could just <br/>\nbe quiet enough for the others participating that was enough.<br/>\nWhile several moms got up and did a &quot;report&quot; (lecture) on a <br/>\nparticular snake, the kids were supposed to take notes and at the end <br/>\nthey&#39;d have this snake journal.<br/>\nWell my boys were 6 and 9 at the time and not even vaguely interested <br/>\nin taking notes. So they didn&#39;t. This really pissed off a first year <br/>\nhomeschooler that is SUPER controlling.<br/>\nSo then the art project for the day......<br/>\nThey were supposed to make a particular snake, not just do art for <br/>\nthe sake of fun. My boys whispered &quot;do we have to do it like she says <br/>\nMom?&quot; I replied of course not, it&#39;s your project and art is about <br/>\ndoint what you enjoy, do whatever kind of snake thingy you want.<br/>\nWell, Trevor was getting into his project, totally enjoying himself <br/>\nand obviously NOT making the snake they were supposed to, when she <br/>\ncomes along and informs him he&#39;s doing it wrong.<br/>\nHis reply?<br/>\n&quot;My Mom said we could do whatever we wanted.&quot;<br/>\nOOOOOH! You should have seen the glares I got at that point. I mean, <br/>\nif my child could do what he wanted, that really messes up the <br/>\nthoughtless following process the other kids were doing. ugh.<br/>\nAfter the class, I did explain to her why I told them that and shared <br/>\nsome of our homeschooling philosophies. She was totally confused. <br/>\nAnother Mom explained the Charlotte Mason method and helped her <br/>\nunderstand a bit more. She didn&#39;t get it to say the least, but <br/>\nstrangely enough, she&#39;s lost some of her rough edges and we still <br/>\nstay in touch. She understands how I homeschool and would never dream <br/>\nof encroaching on that again, but she still thinks I&#39;m a bubble short <br/>\nof plumb!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is (there really is one, I swear) is that you can <br/>\nparticipate in these things and gain from them.

If there is something they don&#39;t want to do, don&#39;t <br/>\nmake them. Or adapt it. Like the art project we &quot;adapted&quot;....if you <br/>\nlet them do the activities in their own way, even if it wasn&#39;t <br/>\nexactly what the leader envisioned, they will get something out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would love to take the class!!! It sounds awesome. I <br/>\njust might do my own version here.<br/>\nAny time I can combine History and food, I&#39;m a happy camper.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8433,"nextTopicId":8493}}
