They touch on so many situations that we as parents live through each day.   I am by no means an unschooler (yet), I am in the process of gleaning, learning and healing myself and my children. We are making changes and transitions as a family, but one at a time. My husband came from from deployments as an abusive Father and husband and we are working and coping our way through the crescendo of that wave. Over the years I have molded and allowed myself to be molded from an intuitive parent to a hectic and harried one.  I completely lost my focus and center. One of my goals at the moment is to deschedule our lives as much as possible. For a few years now we have been on a roller coaster, and it&#39;s time to RELEARN how to stop and smell the roses. We are learning a whole new way to be. My goals are gentleness and respect. My childrens&#39; joy, peace and love.  After years of trying to please others by conforming in the area of being on time especially, I now tell people that I have 7 children. We will arrive where we are going just as soon as we can peacefully get there. After years of YELLING &quot;Go, go GO GET IN THE CAR, NOW, HURRY, HURRY GOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;. I simply tell people that I won&#39;t disrespect my children in that way. It has been surprising how open people have been to that. Too often I looked for the approval of others rather than joy in being where I was. I love and loved every moment, but I wasn&#39;t ever really 100% present. My children too are having to learn to be patient and loving. These lessons are so much more important than anything they could ever learn in a classroom. They are blossoming. We have a lot of healing to do, and a long ways to go, but I wanted to thank you all for giving me food for thought and reminding me as a parent that it is not in one or two areas or however many, children, because they simple ARE deserve to be listened to, loved respected and cherished.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nStefanie in Alaska</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":64919,"nextTopicId":64987}}
