Now, who said that?&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, Martinez says, &quot;George Bush to the Japanese Prime <br/>\nMinister, 1991.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNow furious, another student yells, &quot;Oh yeah? Suck this!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMartinez jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the <br/>\nteacher, &quot;Bill Clinton, to Mon! ica Lewinsky, 1997!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nNow with almost a mob hysteria someone sa id, &quot;You little shit.
