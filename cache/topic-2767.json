Even if he were having a bad day, I would say something like, &quot;I<br/>\nknow today isn&#39;t going the way you wanted, but it isn&#39;t my fault and the<br/>\nthings you are saying hurt my feelings.&quot;  I say the same kinds of things to<br/>\nmy kids.    A couple of days ago, Adriane (11) was really being snotty and<br/>\nshort tempered and I said something like the above to her.  In a little<br/>\nwhile, she came to me and apologized, talked to me about what was stressing<br/>\nher and we worked to fix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked with my 3yo today about how it hurts people&#39;s feelings when they<br/>\nare called stupid.  I didn&#39;t punish him or yell at him, but I talked with<br/>\nhim about it.  I don&#39;t think unschooling is about saying that mean behavior<br/>\nor whatever is ok for children.  Only that because the kids are learning,<br/>\nthey are going to make mistakes (just like adults) and we need to know that<br/>\nand expect it and not shame them because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion--why is it &quot;indignation&quot; in an adult and a &quot;tantrum&quot; in a kid?<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie--who had a tantrum yesterday that would have made any 2yo proud  :(</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2768,"nextTopicId":2771}}
