Bulbs will arise that you didn&#39;t plant.   And maybe you  <br/>\noriginally bought some bulbs, or someone gave them to you, or you  <br/>\nbought a house where some were already in the ground.  But there were  <br/>\noriginal bulbs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list and the sites and blogs you can get to so easily from it  <br/>\nare like a big bulb exchange.  You can gather up TONS of ideas and  <br/>\ninspirations and warnings and reminders, but nobody can put those  <br/>\nbulbs in the ground at your house but you.

I bought really good  <br/>\nquality colored pencils (Prismacolor) and coloring books for our cross- <br/>\ncountry train trip and all the girls on the trip really enjoyed them.  <br/>\nI got Dover coloring books - one is costumes, another is cats, another  <br/>\nis fashion, one is butterflies, and there was also an art masterpieces  <br/>\none.

What makes sense  <br/>\nto me is to say that 4 to 5 year olds might like these activities, but  <br/>\nit doesn&#39;t make sense to think of the activities as being &quot;for&quot; four  <br/>\nto five year olds. It was fun to think back about what my girls loved  <br/>\ndoing at that age - but, really, what I had was either a 4 yo and 1 yo  <br/>\nor a 7 yo, 4 yo, and 1 yo, or an 11 yo, 7, and 4 yo. And they all  <br/>\nenjoyed the activities I mentioned, it wasn&#39;t specifically or only the  <br/>\nfour year old.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor several years I ran a girl scout troop that had girls from 4 to 16  <br/>\nyears old. What we noticed, in a big way, was that the activities we  <br/>\nthought were aimed at the younger girls were very very often taken up  <br/>\nwith great gusto by the older girls - they were visibly thrilled to  <br/>\nhave the chance to engage in a lot of the activities that most people  <br/>\nwould have judged were &quot;too young&quot; for them. And, sometimes, the  <br/>\nyounger girls would work with the materials intended for the older  <br/>\ngirls and have a great time - sometimes surprising us with their  <br/>\ncompetencies, sometimes using the same materials to do simpler things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we&#39;re better off to think in terms of what a particular child  <br/>\nmight enjoy, rather than generalizing about certain ages of kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Is Unschooling about Activities?","postDate":"1215285053","msgId":36151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEM4RjAwMjg0LTU2NUYtNDc2RS04QzQwLTdGMUFEMEMzRjhBNkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":36161,"prevInTime":36150,"nextInTime":36152,"topicId":36151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Is Unschooling about activities?

If I added &quot;activities&quot; to the top of my list of topics, it  <br/>\nwould mar the whole operation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere aren&#39;t &quot;unschooling activities.&quot;  There are real-world  <br/>\nactivities.  Unschooling is a different way of seeing those  <br/>\nactivities, a different way of engaging in them, and of valuing them  <br/>\nin retrospect.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrainstorming on this list is one thing and it&#39;s not a bad thing!   <br/>\nHaving those ideas where people will come across them isn&#39;t a bad  <br/>\nthing at all.  But if I start collecting activities for 4 and 5 year  <br/>\nolds, will people want a new and different set of activities for 6  <br/>\nyear olds?  Or if there&#39;s a list of things to do, will people come  <br/>\nback and say &quot;We did all that.  Now what?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m still thinking, but it seems it&#39;s more important to discuss why  <br/>\nand how than what.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36121,"nextTopicId":36250}}
