You found the avenue by saying &quot;yes&quot; to her interest! Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS amazing what our children will lead us to when we stay open, <br/>\nwhen we stay curious and interested in EVERYTHING.:)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a Hot Topic store near you, you might check out their <br/>\nstock. They often have Invader Zim shirts or buttons and such.  I <br/>\nbet she&#39;d like that. Plus, the employees usually have colorful hair <br/>\nand interesting styles. I&#39;ve also found very fun unschoolish bumper <br/>\nstickers.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy wherever this cartoon path leads, I be you&#39;ll be amazed quite <br/>\noften at the learning it swirls into your lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I think what Sandra way trying to say about not posting when <br/>\nyou&#39;re feeling negative, is simply to expect strong reactions. If <br/>\nyou can handle them (obviously you can!), then I suppose it&#39;s not a <br/>\nproblem....sometimes I stop to think a bit more before I hit &quot;send&quot; <br/>\nthese days. These lists cause you to do a lot of self <br/>\nexamination....a very good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22996,"nextTopicId":23009}}
