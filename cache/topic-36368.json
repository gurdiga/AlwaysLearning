I&#39;ve not given my okay yet -- dh is really reluctant to <br/>\nlet them sell toys he feels they&#39;ll likely miss very soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome history on these games.  We gave them each a new DS January 07, <br/>\nand they were thrilled. Played them virtually all the time.  Andy <br/>\n(12yo) wore his out.  In January 08, our home was broken into, all <br/>\nthe electronics were stolen, including the DS and games, one of our <br/>\ncomputers (we interrupted them, and the left one puter behind as they <br/>\nfled), our DVD player, digital camera, etc.  By the time we&#39;d dug up <br/>\nthe info for the insurance company (which always pays so little <br/>\nanyway), it was mid April before we replaced their DSs.  Within days, <br/>\nDan -- who had considered a guitar instead, but chose the DS, had <br/>\nregrets almost immediately.  He often misplaces his DS for days, and <br/>\ntho he has several games he doesn&#39;t play it all that often.  Andy <br/>\nreally enjoyed his DS, tho recently he plays with it less. He often <br/>\nonly owns one game, preferring to spend his allowance on other <br/>\nthings. <br/>\n<br/>\nI say all this to explain that I can see they aren&#39;t all that <br/>\nattached to their DS, but I do find having those makes a convenient <br/>\ndistraction on road trips.  We&#39;re taking a family trip over Labor Day <br/>\nto San Francisco, so about 18 hrs in the car each way.  Time to fill <br/>\nwithout DS games - which has dh concerned it will be a l-o-o-n-g road <br/>\ntrip, with seriously bored, restless children.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo weeks ago, we got a PS2 -- the boys choice for their part of the <br/>\nstimulus check -- and 4 games.  The boys love it, and have spent <br/>\nhours each day playing their games on it.  They&#39;ve decided that&#39;s <br/>\nenough for them, and they&#39;d rather trade their DS for other toy <br/>\npurchases.  Dan still would like an electric guitar.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concerns are ..... the novelty of the PS-2 will wane, and they&#39;ll <br/>\nwish the still had DS games; they won&#39;t get much money for their DS <br/>\nstuff, will spend it away on smaller toys of fleeting value to them, <br/>\nand when they realize they&#39;d like DS again, they&#39;ll need to save up <br/>\ntheir allowances to buy new, because our budget simply won&#39;t cover <br/>\nnew DS for each boy.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey&#39;ve often traded games and smaller things, sold toys to friends, <br/>\netc to raise smaller bits of money and seldom regret it, but this <br/>\nseems like a big deal to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur policy has always been that once we give them an item, it&#39;s <br/>\ntheirs to do with as they wish.  Any past &#39;sell-offs&#39; have always <br/>\nbeen smaller toys, not big things, which made it easier to hold to.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI really want to trust their judgment and choice in this, but I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant them to seriously regret their choice? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone have experience with this?  Suggestions for how to respond?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re off to Gamestop to see what they could get for their DS items --<br/>\n just recon, no one is going to sell anything today.  Dh really wants <br/>\nthem to wait a week or two to be sure they really want this <br/>\nbefore &#39;allowing&#39; them to sell their own stuff.  I find myself <br/>\ndefending their right to make their own choices, but want to protect <br/>\nthem from the risks -- not to mention I don&#39;t want to hear dh later <br/>\npoint out that we shouldn&#39;t have let them do this if they have <br/>\nregrets.<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36356,"nextTopicId":36431}}
