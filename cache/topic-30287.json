Other daughter Dani(2) camps out in a <br/>\nbasket with pillows.<br/>\n<br/>\nCassie came home today and crashed on *her* couch, the problem was <br/>\nthat just minutes before Dani was hanging out on the couch. They <br/>\nboth wanted the couch without the other one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey proceeded to scratch and pull at each other. I took them both <br/>\nand said we do not hurt each other we can work this out. Cassie <br/>\nproceeded to scream at the top of her lungs and Dani tried to bury <br/>\nher head in the pillows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sat between them and started talking about how each one wanted the <br/>\ncouch and there had to be some way to work it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas--<br/>\nsit on both ends<br/>\ncassie couch dani basket<br/>\nOlder brother said Dani gets it she never gets it<br/>\ndad said cut it in half<br/>\ndad said buy a new recliner<br/>\nI said lay together<br/>\n<br/>\nafter a few minutes of negotiating and nothing working<br/>\nI got up off the couch<br/>\n<br/>\nCassie took the cushions off the couch and *made* her own couch on <br/>\nthe floor and got pillows for Dani to cushion her couch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point is they found a way to make it work and on their own- not <br/>\nbecause I made them share or took sides or made it fair. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for being there to teach me how to respect both my <br/>\nkids and others. It is not my way or your way it can all be worked <br/>\nout somehow when you put enough brain cells to it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulieH</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30272,"nextTopicId":30233}}
