I have<br/>\nseen my MIL lock a screaming baby in a room alone, let<br/>\nhim scream so hard he vomitted, and then let him sleep<br/>\nin his vomit.  These were my SIL&#39;s kids.  They (my dh<br/>\nand his sibs) were treated like that, and SIL lets her<br/>\nparents treat her kids like that as well.  I have<br/>\ncalled them to the carpet many times, and they treat<br/>\nmy kids with respect (although at arms length, but I<br/>\nthink that&#39;s a good thing) while they treat her kids<br/>\ntotally different.
