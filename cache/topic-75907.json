While I&#39;ve already read through most of her website, something about having an actual book in my hands made it seem more special. Maybe it&#39;s the feel of the paper, or the smell of a new book (although I particularly love the smell of old books even more), or the fact that I can make notations or turn down pages which are particularly meaningful to me. It just seems to make it more MINE.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Anyway, yesterday when I was reading through it, I had an epiphany about this whole reading thing because of something that she said.

It was this particular quote that hit me :&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>~= I am so certain that learning comes from experiences and touching, hearing, seeing, smelling and tasting that in light of natural learning, books seem flat and dry.=~ (p. 148)</div><div><br></div><div>Just that one sentence turned everything upside down for me.

It wasn&#39;t so much that it was Little House play- it was just the first example that came to mind. I wasn&#39;t concerned so much with the content of what I read to them as with making sure my kids ACTUALLY enjoy being read to. I don&#39;t want them to feel like they have to listen. Maybe instead of telling them that I&#39;m going to start reading, I&#39;ll start asking them if anyone would like for me to read. It can be tricky finding a good time to read because with 10 kids there&#39;s always someone exploring or building something, and I don&#39;t want to interrupt them.
