Our nation&#39;s educators are finally cracking<br/>\n&gt; down on an insidious evil that imperils our schoolchildren<br/>\n&gt; every day-a dark and sinister scourge of the schoolyard...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Is it drugs?

Yes, it&#39;s because of injuries-but not the<br/>\n&gt; bruises, scrapes and skinned knees you might be thinking of.<br/>\n&gt; It&#39;s because of the possibility of hurt... feelings!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m not kidding. Over-protective educators (see also &quot;amateur<br/>\n&gt; psychologists&quot;) in school districts from at least seven<br/>\n&gt; states have recently banned dodge ball and similar playground<br/>\n&gt; games on the grounds that they may be harmful to some kids&#39;<br/>\n&gt; self-esteem. Hmmm. I wonder how they plan to teach these poor<br/>\n&gt; kids to regain their self-confidence-by growing up and suing<br/>\n&gt; the school bully for emotional trauma?  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m also wondering: Do these same teachers blame their own<br/>\n&gt; failings in life on the emotional scars of having been beaned<br/>\n&gt; with a red rubber ball during 3rd grade recess? Do they<br/>\n&gt; really think that the reason they ended up miserable and<br/>\n&gt; underpaid (in their opinion) is because they were once &quot;it&quot;<br/>\n&gt; during a schoolyard game of tag?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And what&#39;s really sad is this: These misguided fools think<br/>\n&gt; they&#39;re guarding kids&#39; self-esteem, but they&#39;re actually<br/>\n&gt; destroying it. Those fragile, untested egos will have a hard<br/>\n&gt; time holding up down the road, when the dog-eat-dog reality<br/>\n&gt; of life hits them full in the face-and Mrs. Beeswax isn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; there to protect them anymore. I have a pretty good idea of<br/>\n&gt; what&#39;ll happen-and it doesn&#39;t take a degree in psychology to<br/>\n&gt; figure it out, either. Oh well, at least they&#39;ll qualify for<br/>\n&gt; teaching certificates...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Look, nobody said it was fair, but it&#39;s a harsh reality of<br/>\n&gt; life that we learn many of the most important lessons the<br/>\n&gt; hard way-and some of them come at the hands of our enemies in<br/>\n&gt; the schoolyard. And that&#39;s also where we learn how to<br/>\n&gt; function as part of a team, how to fit into a group (or how<br/>\n&gt; to develop self-reliance when we don&#39;t fit in). It&#39;s where we<br/>\n&gt; learn what we&#39;re good at, what our strengths and weaknesses<br/>\n&gt; are-and how we handle pressure and adversity. It&#39;s where we<br/>\n&gt; learn to stick up for ourselves, and what we&#39;re really made<br/>\n&gt; of.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; No teacher in the world can teach children these lessons. But<br/>\n&gt; in at least seven states now, they can prevent our kids from<br/>\n&gt; learning them until it&#39;s way too late... <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Action to take: Teach your kids at home. It&#39;s their only<br/>\n&gt; hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yeah, it is where we learn our place all right. What&#39;s wrong with Rap <br/>\nMusic?
