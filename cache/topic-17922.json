I <br/>\nalso have to say that my child has decided that she really likes <br/>\nbeing in a mixed group, not strictly home educators, and not just <br/>\nunschoolers. This is the real world, all different kinds of people, <br/>\nand she feels that this kind of experience, whether it&#39;s camping or <br/>\nanything else, is better for her.  There is something very insular <br/>\nand also very restricted in the predominantly white, predominantly <br/>\nupper middle class unschooling community.  She actually finds the UU <br/>\nkids to be much more open-minded, and definitely more inclusive and <br/>\nmore integrated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I know that all unschoolers are not from a high income strata, <br/>\nbecause we aren&#39;t.  But she found NBTSC to be very cliquish, more so <br/>\nthan most any other experience she has had.  And part of that is <br/>\nperhaps because many of these kids have been attending for years <br/>\n(kids who can afford that, hence a certain income bracket, which is <br/>\nseparative to begin with) and stick with their own group of friends.  <br/>\nWheras she did not find this at all at Earlham College&#39;s two-week <br/>\nsummer Explore-A-College program, a very homeschool friendly program, <br/>\nby the way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone plans to go to NBTSC my daughter and I both recommend <br/>\ntaking along a goodly stash of food, just in case.  Almost all of the <br/>\nkids in her cabin who had attended camp before had brought boxes and <br/>\nbags of their own food.  She felt we had been lied to about the <br/>\nfood.  We were told that it would be good healthy predominantly <br/>\nvegetarian food.  It wasn&#39;t.  My daughter has chosen all her life to <br/>\nbe a lacto-ovo vegetarian and she found very little that was <br/>\nacceptable to eat at the NBTSC that she attended.  Plus she also <br/>\nfound that a certain group of campers hoarded all the good food, took <br/>\nit back to their cabins for themselves.  With no adult intervention <br/>\nshe went through a week with very little sustenance to ward off the <br/>\ndamp and cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand she attended a Swedenborgian church camp with some <br/>\nfriends, like what your daughter is considering doing, and loved it <br/>\nbut said there were more Christian elements to deal with than she <br/>\nliked.  But she still had a very good time, made good friends.  4-H <br/>\ncamp, which in most parts of the country anyone can attend, even if <br/>\nthey are not in 4-H, was more structured, too, but she enjoyed it, <br/>\nhad her first slow dancing (and her first crush) there with a very <br/>\nnice boy, at 12.  She also attended a 4-H art day-camp in a nearby <br/>\ncounty one summer when she was even younger (11) and loved it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, consider your child and her propensities, and choose what <br/>\nmight work best for her.  As for getting it &quot;straight from the <br/>\nhorse&#39;s mouth&quot; on the NBTSC kids&#39; list, they, too, do not want anyone <br/>\nto say anything negative about &quot;their&quot; camp, and can be just as <br/>\nmalicious and vindictive as some of the very censoring parents.  I <br/>\njust know that we were far from the only folks who attended camp in <br/>\nW. Virginia who were unhappy with this specific NBTSC session.  All <br/>\nwho were unhappy have been censored or driven from the adult and <br/>\nkids&#39; NBTSC lists.  Doesn&#39;t give anyone a very realistic picture.  <br/>\nAnd when I compared my daughter&#39;s experience at two other camps the <br/>\nfollowing summer, well, they were so much better, she enjoyed them so <br/>\nmuch more.  And she felt she came away with a much more valuable life <br/>\nexperience.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for making friends, she is involved in so many outside activities <br/>\nthat she has plenty of opportunities to make friends, from <br/>\nhomeschoolers, to unschoolers, to everyone else, and all ages, too.  <br/>\nShe is a volunteer at our local museum center (history and science <br/>\nand children&#39;s musuems), a historical interpreter at our local <br/>\nhistorical village, involved in many community service projects, <br/>\nstarted her own 4-H club, started her own homeschool Junior Statesman <br/>\nFoundation group (grades 9-12), is a competitive figure skater (9 <br/>\nyears), and is a ceramicist who has been taking ceramics (pottery) <br/>\nand other art courses from a local art foundation for six years, is <br/>\nnow the only teen in an adult ceramics center/studio, working on <br/>\nperfecting her centering and throwing skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also works part-time at her local ice rink and at our local <br/>\nlibrary.  She has adult coaches with whom she is close and a bunch of <br/>\nreally great librarians with whom she enjoys working very much.  And <br/>\nshe has her UU teen friends, as well as the great group of adults <br/>\nthere, lots of opportunities to interact socially.  Her current <br/>\nboy/friend is someone she met at a party through other friends, the <br/>\nusual way, and someone equally artsy (a jazz musician) who attends <br/>\none of the local performing arts public schools.  Next weekend she <br/>\nwill be attending her third winter formal dance at a local high <br/>\nschool, her fifth formal dance since she was 13.  Just wanted to <br/>\nestablish that we are not talking about someone who is in any way <br/>\nsocially isolated or who has limited social skills.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPick whatever camps or experiences you choose based on your <br/>\ndaughter&#39;s interests and know that how much you spend, or how reknown <br/>\nthe camp&#39;s founder is (because she wrote a book about other people&#39;s <br/>\nunschooling experiences) does not make a camp better than some other <br/>\nexperience.  I guess I have been most disappointed in the way the <br/>\nparents acted when I voiced my complaints about this camp.  You&#39;d <br/>\nhave thought I was attacking them personally when I expressed my <br/>\nunhappiness with some of the things my daughter experienced at <br/>\nNBTSC.  Rather than saying, wow, they would really want to see that <br/>\nkind of thing not happen and would work to help get it changed, they <br/>\njust circled the wagons, attacked me, then excluded me from their <br/>\nlist.  NBTSC, love it, or leave it!  No one offered to set up a <br/>\nparents&#39; committee to try to see that these types of things would not <br/>\nhappen again or find solutions to these problems.  And I think <br/>\nphysical coercion, racial slurs and dealing with other suicidal teens <br/>\nis much more serious than just being cold all the time and not having <br/>\nenough to eat for a week.  That&#39;s really all I have to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nNorma</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":118406848,"authorName":"joylyn","from":"joylyn &lt;joylyn@...&gt;","profile":"joylynrsf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Thoughts about summer camp?","postDate":"1074480232","msgId":17958,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwMEI0NDY4LjgwNzAyMDhAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE5MDIzMTM3LjQwMzA5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDIwMDQwMTE5MDIzMTM3LjQwMzA5LnFtYWlsQHdlYjQxNDE1Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17957,"nextInTopic":17982,"prevInTime":17957,"nextInTime":17959,"topicId":17922,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You are right about the friend thing.

Do you think it&#39;s best to just wait and <br/>\nsee if she asks to go? Or is there a special camp just for unschoolers? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why I feel so strongly that camp is a good idea. Maybe because they have <br/>\nequipment and activities that I wouldn&#39;t have access to (water skiing, ceramics, theater <br/>\nproductions, canoe trips, horseback riding, etc.) or maybe because I feel it&#39;s healthy <br/>\nfor kids to be away from their parents sometimes? <br/>\n<br/>\nShe is so kinetic, asking her to sit still in school all day would just crush her spirit, I <br/>\nknow it. At camp she&#39;d get to do tennis and volleyball and soccer and softball etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Vijay</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17878,"nextTopicId":17907}}
