I actually enjoy watching her for the<br/>\nsame reasons!  She justs slides and floats across the mat so fast and<br/>\neasy.  I really don&#39;t know how she does it, but it&#39;s pretty cool to<br/>\nwatch!  These days, I can&#39;t even beat her while playing 2 levels down,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t mind, I like it when my kids win even if I lose!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Wii, do you get to use your arms too?  Now that would be fun,<br/>\narms, and feet all added to the mix!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"DDR was Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: new with a few questions","postDate":"1219303125","msgId":37360,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI0NTI4MC45NTE3My5xbUB3ZWI4NjIxMS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":37369,"prevInTime":37359,"nextInTime":37361,"topicId":37360,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If you ever get a chance to watch Jenny s daughter play DDR it is the most beautiful thing.
