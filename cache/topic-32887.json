It&#39;s not always a moment of joyful happy-dance, but it  <br/>\nis useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis builds up quite a while before getting to the dire and misguided  <br/>\npoint, but they quoted Pam Sorooshian in there, and other people<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.triviumpursuit.com/articles/\">http://www.triviumpursuit.com/articles/</a> <br/>\nearly_academics_and_unschooling.php<br/>\n<br/>\nQuotes from it in case you don&#39;t want to go there (I would not blame  <br/>\nyou a bit):<br/>\n<br/>\n*************<br/>\n<br/>\nwe would like to make a statement, for the record, regarding the  <br/>\nfalse but persistent notion that we advocate some form of unschooling  <br/>\nbefore age ten. From the way some people talk, you could get the  <br/>\nimpression that we believe children should be left to wander about  <br/>\naimlessly, foraging in the forests for food, suffering from a dearth  <br/>\nof discipline, until their tenth birthday.<br/>\n<br/>\n************<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in neither the training nor the teaching do we advocate leaving  <br/>\nthe child alone to explore his own interests. Children are not little  <br/>\nadults.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrain on Time<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the basis of Scripture, we thoroughly reject the notion of  <br/>\nunschooling – in principle and in practice – especially before age  <br/>\nten. The Scripture doctrines of original sin and total depravity  <br/>\nshould forever end the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n************NOT A QUOTE, a Sandra note:<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo new sins I learned from that site:<br/>\n<br/>\n  the Sin of Hasty Conclusions, and &quot;intellectual misbehavior&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother quote:<br/>\n<br/>\n***************************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first half of this verse tells us that a child must be  <br/>\ndisciplined with the rod and reproved for his misbehavior.  <br/>\nMisbehavior may be manifested in a multitude of ways, including  <br/>\nintellectual misbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEND OF QUOTES<br/>\n<br/>\nSo whether or not they do it themselves (unschool), they&#39;re assuring  <br/>\nall readers that it involves leaving children alone, one way or  <br/>\nanother.  I don&#39;t see anything in their quotes and examples that says  <br/>\n&quot;leave them alone&quot; at all, but they seem to saying to be with them,  <br/>\nexplore with them, let them do real things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to collect more links to criticism of unschooling, for those  <br/>\npeople who come by and say they want the other side, too.  I&#39;ll start  <br/>\nwith this link and put it here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschool/criticism\">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/criticism</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32703,"nextTopicId":32617}}
