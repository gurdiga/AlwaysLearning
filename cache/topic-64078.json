I deleted it from the queue and would have sent the poster a message, but it didn&#39;t show up in my e-mail and I didn&#39;t take down the e-mail of the post I was returning. Sorry about that.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I will say here:<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t call anyone a killjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF someone destroys the joy of a child, then (literally) that person has been (in that situation) a killjoy (having killed some joy).<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s talk about the ideas presented whenever possible, and not about the people presenting the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce wrote this, and I hope everyone will read it, and if it&#39;s new to you, read it twice:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>\nThink of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s on this page, which might also be worth reading twice:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63893,"nextTopicId":64045}}
