Are kids complaining? **<br/>\n<br/>\nI will confess that I was kind of falling into this trap, early on.  When my<br/>\nkid was 7 or 8, I kept waiting for him to be have an interest in something<br/>\nsemi-academic -- Ancient Egypt or bugs or something.  (Then I probably would<br/>\nhave buried him under an avalanche of &quot;enriching&quot; ideas.)  I was kind of<br/>\nselective in my thinking.  It took me awhile to realize that he did have an<br/>\ninterest, a strong interest in Pokemon.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I had the very same thing happen to me and I am still dealing with it.<br/>\nMy youngest has become interested in paintball....boy, have I opened my mind<br/>\nto somethings around that.  I continue to &quot;push&quot; some of my ideas,<br/>\ninterests, etc. and we have a discipline of reading everyday (he has been<br/>\nlabeled dyslexic)...I let him choose what we read but we do read and we do<br/>\nplay around with math facts from time to time.  I&#39;m not a purist(unschooler)<br/>\nand have no wish to be, but more and more I see the value in giving my kids<br/>\nas much freedom to choose as I can responsibly tolerate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things that has concerned me about things like video games and<br/>\npokeman cards is the fact that there is an enormous promotion via the media<br/>\nmachine out there selling this stuff to our kids.  So I feel quite strongly<br/>\nabout my continued role as parent in checking these things out, but mostly,<br/>\nmy kids are good at choosing for themselves what&#39;s appropriate.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s hard, in the beginning, to get over the idea that kids need to<br/>\nlearn most of the same &quot;subject matter&quot; as school kids.  I was the kind of<br/>\nkid who always sat around with a book, often a historical novel, and one of<br/>\nmy best friends has a homeschooled daughter much like me.  In the early<br/>\ndays, that was what I kind of imagined that my son would turn out like.<br/>\n(Strange, but true.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo!
