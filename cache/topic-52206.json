But I have to say I am shocked  <br/>\nby how angry you sound at people who think that the majority of  <br/>\nprogramming on television is rude, crude, sexist and anti-family.  I  <br/>\nknow plenty of people who have a blasé attitude about television, but  <br/>\nI&#39;ve never seen anyone so viscously pro-tv before.  Do you watch  <br/>\ntelevision?  Have you channel surfed at all hours of the day?  I have  <br/>\nspent a lot of time watching television the last two years, while on  <br/>\nbed rest, and I&#39;ve watched all hours of the day and night.  I know  <br/>\nwhat is on tv.  Let me ask you, would you find it offensive if I came  <br/>\ninto your house and had sex in front of your children?  Would you be  <br/>\nappalled if I went into your neighbors house and had sex in front of  <br/>\ntheir children?  How would you feel if the neighbors kids came and  <br/>\ntold your children about what they saw?  Well that is what tv does and  <br/>\nthat is how it works.  Even if you don&#39;t let your kids watch it,  <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s children will and will influence your children with  <br/>\nthat information.  I truly wish you will rethink your position.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time,<br/>\nSincerely,<br/>\nYour Neighbor<br/>\n<br/>\nPS- The sex analogy is just the tip of the iceburg.  Sex, drugs,  <br/>\nsexism, racism, violence, no respect for parental authority and no  <br/>\nrespect for humanity is what tv brings us.<br/>\n<br/>\n================================<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you just came and ranted at me in my e-mail, while I never  <br/>\ncontacted you directly.<br/>\nNo one in my family is that antagonistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know where you saw anger on my site.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I have spent a lot of time watching television the last two years,  <br/>\nwhile on bed rest-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don&#39;t you buy some books or magazines, or rent DVDs?  No one is  <br/>\nforcing you to watch television.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Let me ask you, would you find it offensive if I came into your  <br/>\nhouse and had sex in front of your children?  Would you be appalled if  <br/>\nI went into your neighbors house and had sex in front of their  <br/>\nchildren? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you insane?<br/>\nI do feel a little bit like you came into my computer and took a crap  <br/>\non my screen.<br/>\n<br/>\n-= Even if you don&#39;t let your kids watch it, someone else&#39;s children  <br/>\nwill and will influence your children with that information.  I truly  <br/>\nwish you will rethink your position.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Rethinking my position&quot; won&#39;t change anything, if you&#39;re correct that  <br/>\nother people&#39;s children will come and have all the ill effects of  <br/>\ntelevision even if I were to have prevented mine from watching it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did let my children watch it, and they&#39;ve grown up into sweet and  <br/>\npeaceful young adults who would never dream of addressing anyone as  <br/>\nyou have me.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=I don&#39;t know anything about you other than what you have written  <br/>\nabout television and school on your website. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps you should get to know more about a person before you attack  <br/>\nher so rudely and directly.  I have written very little about school  <br/>\nanywhere, and most of what is on my site about television was not  <br/>\nwritten by me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52287,"nextTopicId":52328}}
