Well Marty can&#39;t go get a new phone, because he&#39;s on my family  <br/>\naccount and I have to be there to sign for any changes to the  <br/>\naccount.  So I said &quot;Let&#39;s go get one, then.&quot;  Marty didn&#39;t really  <br/>\nwant to.  He had pajama pants on.  He was barefooted.  I had a smaller  <br/>\nwindow of time, because of taking care of Keith and needing to go to  <br/>\nthe post office before they closed, and his having told his girlfriend  <br/>\nhe would go to a fabric store with her, and his having regular  <br/>\nThursday role playing.  So we have this 45 minute window, and not  <br/>\nanother one for another 20 hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe kinda sighed and said he didn&#39;t really want to go right then, and I  <br/>\ngave him the eyebrows of &quot;Really!?  Are you serious!?&quot; (as much as  <br/>\neyebrows can say exactly that).  He smiled and said &quot;I guess since Dad  <br/>\nalready gave me the money and you need to be there, we should go, huh?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s as close as I&#39;ve come lately to &quot;making&quot; Marty do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went, there was a line, he looked at the phones and said he needed  <br/>\ntime to think.

None of the other phones have internet.  Kirby, who  <br/>\nlives on his own, has a fully-everything iPhone, but that&#39;s not on our  <br/>\nfamily account.

Yesterday, though, Linnaea wanted to go to a pottery class that Simon didn&#39;t really want to go to. He was willing to hang out outside or in the car and to play with the dog and on his ds and to listen to stories and music on the ipod instead of doing any pottery. So that&#39;s how he accomodated Linnaea&#39;s desire to do something that he didn&#39;t want to participate in. He came up with his own response, he didn&#39;t even really discuss it with me. However, it wouldn&#39;t have been an option when he was younger. He&#39;s 12 now.

[huffs and sits down with arms crossed] Now I have to sit here until I forget you told me to do it and it can be my idea again.&quot;<br/>\n  *********<br/>\n<br/>\n  there really, truly, really, truly are kids who *need* a &quot;collaborative problem solving&quot; approach for a itsy bitsy number of subjects (that would, in the explosive child language, be put into &#39;plan b&#39; - things to work on together/negotiate - and then they need a VAST number of things to be in &#39;plan c&#39; - not worth confronting/addressing - need to let it go - and pretty much nothing in plan A (commands).  At first glance, i think that sounds a lot like unschooling, for most kids, because unschoolers don&#39;t tend to say no without trying to find a way to &quot;yes&quot; first, we don&#39;t tend to order our kids around, and we let a lot of stuff that doesn&#39;t really matter, go.  however, when i say nothing can be in plan A with some kids - i mean even the occasional &quot;if you want to go to the aquarium with grandma, you need to take a shower&quot;, said kindly and compassionately. and it *certainly* wouldn&#39;t work to say it firmly, or yell about it.  and when i say &quot;can&#39;t&quot; be in plan A, i mean without HUGE repercussions/explosions. <br/>\n<br/>\n   i am also very aware while i am typing, that my kids have not been lifelong unschoolers, so that could be interpreted as enough off a reason for the explosivity - but, my older daughter, who was in school longer, and actually suffered more and struggled with me more, while she was in school, has come to the point, after only 1.5 years of unschooling (to her brother&#39;s &gt;2) where those &quot;methods&quot; are just not necessary - we can talk about stuff in a respectful way, as i would with any other human, and she can listen to &quot;no&quot; with not much reason, once in a while, she can respond  compassionately to MY needs sometimes, and we have a great relationship.  my son has *always* been explosive and intense, even well before he was in school, and even though he was in school, i was very much his partner in a vast number of other ways when he was younger, supporting him through his &quot;quirky&quot; needs, and intense reactions to seemingly little things.  so to me it&#39;s pretty obvious that while i know he would have been WAY better off not ever being in school, his level of &quot;counterwill&quot; and intensity and sensitivity are temperament traits for him, and really supporting him and helping him requires *seeing* that and accepting it and working with it, rather than trying  to change it.  he has told me that straight out, in several ways.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  i also know many lifelong unschooling families with kids who were quite intense and resistant, even through older stages, 9, 10, 11... (my daughter is nearly 15 and my son is 11.5).  i have generally seen super intense kids mellow a TON, with supportive parenting, around age 12-14 (which is what i am hoping for for my son, and have actually seen a lot of even in the last few months.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  i think there is a very painful culture of parent blaming out there, from almost every camp - &quot;natural parenting&quot;, unschooling, traditional parenting (they blame &quot;permissive parenting&quot;), etc.   and while i think it&#39;s so important to own our own mistakes and that parenting is important, of course, (and i do believe there are better and worse ways to address each situation that arises in parenting, contrary to the &#39;everyone needs to do what works for them&#39; mantra-ists), i also think blaming everything on parenting removes a level of respect from  our kids too, as whole people, who are living NOW.  sometimes kids are quirky, less capable of managing their emotions in intense situations, or shy, or fearful and anxious, or super sensitive, etc. and blaming these differences on parenting is not fair, or helpful.  it IS helpful to help parents see how they can HELP their kids manage their various traits (including traits perceived as &quot;positive&quot; but often very difficult for kids, like ability to be a really good, loyal friend (my daughter is like this and it was a painful way to be in the world, because she found it difficult to meet peers with the same traits, and quite vulnerable and lonely for a long time.) it can also be helpful to assist parents to see how they might be contributing to their child&#39;s struggles, or even causing them.  but to flat out say that when kids don&#39;t go along fairly easily with parent&#39;s  directives or guidance, as they get older, it&#39;s because of resentment against parents is, in my opinion, contributing to the culture of parent blaming, and not an accurate representation of the broad array of temperament types and underlying needs children (people)  experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n  danielle conger writes about unschooling with a spirited child, and ren allen about her &quot;atypical child&quot; - i would venture to guess that those children don&#39;t &#39;go along&quot; with parent&#39;s guidance easily and smoothly, and that it&#39;s NOT because of resentment against their parents....i am not sure if either ren or danielle are on this list, i&#39;ve lost track, but if so, i hope they respond! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n  warmly,  lyla<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bad parenting","postDate":"1267893627","msgId":51548,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE0MDlDNjI3LUE2M0MtNDY5RS04OTkyLTdDQjYzREQwMzIxMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxQkQ1RDJFLTdBQzAtNDQwQS1CQ0Y4LTJEMEZEMDEwODk1MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhtdGdoNStnOTFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MjFCRDVEMkUtN0FDMC00NDBBLUJDRjgtMkQwRkQwMTA4OTUyQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51547,"nextInTopic":51549,"prevInTime":51547,"nextInTime":51549,"topicId":51328,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Here s a list of things to avoid that people on this group came up with a few years ago: http://sandradodd.com/screwitup I m planning to make a list kinda like","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1938758241\">Here&#39;s a list of things to avoid that people on this group came up  <br/>\nwith a few years ago:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/screwitup\">http://sandradodd.com/screwitup</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m planning to make a list kinda like that for a talk I&#39;m giving next  <br/>\nFebruary at a marriage-improvement conference, of ways to screw up a  <br/>\nmarriage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Bad parenting","postDate":"1267892582","msgId":51546,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIxQkQ1RDJFLTdBQzAtNDQwQS1CQ0Y4LTJEMEZEMDEwODk1MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhtdGdoNStnOTFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhtdGdoNStnOTFxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":51545,"nextInTopic":51547,"prevInTime":51545,"nextInTime":51547,"topicId":51328,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Just because you haven t seen something doesn t mean it doesn t exist.

If a child is extremely resistant, though, I think I&#39;d let it go.  Here&#39;s the thing, I&#39;ve rarely seen or met a kid so resistant that they react with that kind of violent reaction.  I imagine the kids that do, are being ignored or whose parents are inattentive in other ways and it&#39;s a build up of objections that get a kid to the point where they&#39;ll react with that kind of aversion to something.  So I guess the long and short of the answer to that question is, &quot;it depends&quot;.  It depends on the relationship in general and how that&#39;s been fostered.  I&#39;m guessing that the moms in the example were attentive moms who gently cleaned their children, or gently held them, even with a minor protest.  I KNOW that there are parents that pin their kids down forcibly to brush their teeth... big difference there! <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: So, what do you tell people?

It&#39;s a cultural process.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thanks, Sandra, for pointing this out.  One of the things that bothers me about the attachment parenting--unshooling continuum is the verbiage that this is the *natural* way.  Many like to cite the primitive cultures from which they&#39;ve appropriated the conventions (EC, babywearing, etc) that define their parenting styles as if this alone makes them worthy.  I&#39;m not saying that there is little value in looking at age-old ways of raising young, but the cherry picking is annoying and, a tad dangerous, perhaps.  How come these same people never mention that at a certain age (if memory serves, around 5),  young males are forcefully pushed away from the mother--if they try to return to her for comfort, they are slapped (I&#39;ll try to find the source I&#39;m referring to).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paradigm shift we&#39;re making with unschooling is not, in my opinion *natural.*  It goes against the very grain of *natural* to most of the dominant culture. *Natural* is for children to be subservient to adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is why the other point re: be very, very careful how you publicize your practices, is so important for people to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen people ask, we are &quot;homeschoolers.&quot;  When they ask about curriculum, I say I write my own. End of story.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we go to a museum or other public event, it is &quot;clean up time.&quot;  This means hair is brushed, clothes are clean (my dd loves to bathe, just not to wash her hair--she does, however, LOVE getting her hair washed at a salon, and it only costs $3, so we do this once a week--every two weeks.  Well worth it!).  My reason: we are representing the homeschool community!  She is too young to smell bad, so I don&#39;t see her less-than-godliness &lt;g&gt; as an affront to others.  But I do think it is important that people don&#39;t get the *wrong* idea about homeschoolers.  We already live in one of the most heavily regulated states, and I don&#39;t want to see it get any worse (home visits, like they&#39;re proposing in the UK,  anyone?)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for behavior.  We recently attended a homeschoolers day at the aquarium.  The tickets they sent had a notice about the &quot;Rules&quot;--they were definitely aimed at school groups, but I thought it was important to read them to dd.  They included: &quot;No running; No yelling; No climbing.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome might say: &quot;How un-unschooly of you to make your daughter walk, speak in a low voice and restrain from climbing on things.&quot;  Have at it.  I actually use the this very phrase before we enter situations like this: &quot;remember, we&#39;re representin&#39;&quot;--she gets it, and I&#39;m not actually *making* her do anything.  It is a choice she&#39;s made herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re currently attending a series of workshops for homeschoolers at a museum.  Both of us are amazed at some of the young people&#39;s behavior.  It is as if no one has ever talked to them about what is expected in these situations.  These are not young children--some are 10 and older--they throw toys, climb on instillations, etc.....<br/>\n<br/>\n*******<br/>\n<br/>\nI watched the Discovery show last night on the unschooling family--anyone else?

If someone asks either Simon or Linnaea why they aren&#39;t in school, they say they are home-educated. Usually the adult will then turn to me for explanation if they want more information. But it never goes very far. People are just making conversation. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the home-educators we know it also doesn&#39;t come up a lot. The people we know well know what we do and the people we don&#39;t know well don&#39;t query that much. With the people who are aware of our approach to home-education I think it was probably through a series of conversations more than through one big bombshell and then a duck and run. My parents know what we do, but don&#39;t really understand it. And when I talk about the kids and their education to my parents it is the stuff that most looks like schooling that I discuss and not the littler stuff. My mom loved telling her step-son-in-law about our discovery of the life cycle of an ichneumon wasp just through observation. He is a chemistry teacher who didn&#39;t think that science was something that could be learned outside of school. <br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose I bend my conversation to the bias of the person I&#39;m talking to, a bit.

If someone asks what  <br/>\nschool my daughter goes to or what grade she&#39;s in, I say &quot;we  <br/>\nhomeschool.&quot; Which is the truth. Unschooling is just a type of  <br/>\nhomeschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can make their own assumptions from there, and most of them  <br/>\nassume we do school-at-home, I think. If they have more questions, I  <br/>\nanswer them in very general terms. I talk about the subjects we are  <br/>\nrequired to cover and testing we are required to do in our state, so  <br/>\nthey know I&#39;m knowledgeable about those things. I will sometimes talk  <br/>\nabout learning happening through all things we do each day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone asks something like &quot;What about chemistry?&quot; I would say  <br/>\nthat we&#39;ll address it as we need to (which may be never, in terms of  <br/>\nformal classes in chemistry, unless that&#39;s something my daughter wants  <br/>\nto do). If people ask &quot;What about high school?&quot; I&#39;ll say that if she  <br/>\nwants to go, we&#39;ll consider it. Stuff like that. Deflection, mostly &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think keeping it simple invites fewer questions and fewer  <br/>\nopportunities to feel like you have to explain. Would anyone know what  <br/>\n&quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; (or &quot;radical unschooling&quot; for that matter)  <br/>\nmeans? If not, you&#39;ll be expected to elaborate, I think. And unless  <br/>\nsomeone is really interested or following a similar path, there&#39;s  <br/>\nreally not much to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will describe to family members and close friends what my daughter  <br/>\nknows and how she learned it.

It also depends on what level of trust I feel towards them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we used to be out and about during school hours (we aren&#39;t too often anymore because Andrew keeps more vampire-ish hours nowadays), when people would ask if Andrew was out sick or if it was a school holiday, I&#39;d just smile and say, &quot;no, we homeschool&quot;. Sometimes people will go on to ask Andrew what his favorite subject is -- he&#39;ll usually give them a schoolish answer (&quot;reading&quot;), they&#39;ll be happy to hear that, then the subject will change to something else -- the random kind of chit-chat that happens with strangers. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he or I are asked what grade he&#39;s in, sometimes I&#39;ll reply with &quot;oh, we homeschool and don&#39;t do things by grade level&quot; -- I&#39;ve never had anyone go beyond that (maybe because I answer with a smile and don&#39;t make a challenge out of it). When he&#39;s going to be in a situation where he might be asked what grade he&#39;s in, I figure that out beforehand and give him the answer and then he can choose if he wants to just give that answer or mention that he homeschools. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe age he is now (11), he understands that pretty much any kid he&#39;s going to meet locally is more traditionally schooled and parented than he is. He&#39;s seen that even kids he&#39;s grown up with all his life (his cousins) and their parents (his aunts and uncles) don&#39;t necessarily grasp our lifestyle and they&#39;ve been exposed to it a great deal. (Fortunately, they don&#39;t judge it and it&#39;s never been an issue.) He&#39;s protective of how we live, so he&#39;s cautious about what kind of info he gives out. If he doesn&#39;t want to tell someone he homeschools, or specifically that he unschools, that&#39;s his choice. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he was younger, his first pediatrician is someone I had concerns might contact CPS about us -- she and I had butted heads about vaccinations and when she began to question (before he was even legally required to be in school) which homeschooling curriculum we would be using, I switched to another pediatrician pretty quickly. We&#39;ve been with that pediatrician for 6 years now and he&#39;s never batted an eye about us homeschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy stepmom can&#39;t wrap her brain around the concept of unschooling. In her mind, everything is in school terms. That used to frustrate me and I wanted her to &quot;get it&quot; about unschooling. Now, though, I understand that she&#39;s genuinely concerned that Andrew&#39;s learning basic skills and that he&#39;s getting socialization, so I answer her questions honestly. It&#39;s never been a source of tension between us, and she doesn&#39;t grill Andrew like some grandparents might. I&#39;ve given her and my dad info about unschooling, and I&#39;m pretty sure my dad&#39;s read it (he&#39;s like me, he&#39;ll read anything!), but he&#39;s never questioned us about unschooling -- he enjoys Andrew for who he is and seems to have a great level of trust that my husband and I wouldn&#39;t do something that would put Andrew at a disadvantage. (My mom is this way also, but she lives nearby and gets to see Andrew often; my dad and stepmom live farther away and only see him several times a year.) When we visited my dad and stepmom in December, when my stepmom and I were alone, she asked how Andrew had learned to read and if he liked to read -- she was genuinely curious and I was happy to have an answer that seemed to give her some level of comfort. She had to drop out of high school to care for her dying mother, so I think that may perhaps be why school is so important to her -- not having a degree was a disadvantage for her, and she wants to be sure Andrew is not disadvantaged by not having a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"Shira Rocklin","from":"Shira Rocklin &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"So, what do you tell people?
