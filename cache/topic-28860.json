My dd has been a little frustrated on and off that <br/>\nshe&#39;s not reading yet--it&#39;s not coming at all from us, but she is getting messages from <br/>\nother kids she meets who are in school, and from the fact that her best friend (unschooler, <br/>\nsame age) is starting to read.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night after reading this post I had a conversation with her and put forth the idea that <br/>\nshe is gathering words and in that vein would she like me to start labeling things around <br/>\nthe house to help her gather more.  She got really excited about it and immediately came <br/>\nup with a game to play where I give her the words on cards and she can take them to <br/>\nwhere they belong in the house.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could tell she regained a sense of control and confidence about the process that has <br/>\nbeen lacking.  I think I was contributing to the lack of confidence by being a little stuck <br/>\nwith my schooled mind.  I didn&#39;t want to &quot;teach,&quot; which is what she was asking for but I <br/>\nknew she didn&#39;t really want, but didn&#39;t know what else to do, so I did nothing.  That wasn&#39;t <br/>\nright either in this situation, because she was aksing me to be more actively present for <br/>\nher.  (She is usually pretty clear about when she wants help and when she doesn&#39;t.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis post helped to free up a little creative thought for me and opened a new paradigm for <br/>\nher.   I&#39;ve been saying to her that she really is learning to read, as she is reading more and <br/>\nmore words, but she knows that she isn&#39;t ready to string them all together yet, so in her <br/>\nmind she is just not reading.  When I presented the new way of looking at it, I think she <br/>\nsuddenly saw herself on a continuum that leads to proficient reading, whearas before it <br/>\nwas an either/or.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Jen.

That lasted about 2 or 3 days before I <br/>\ndropped it.  She never ever got phonics.  The concept evaded her.  It <br/>\nwas like describing the color &quot;red&quot; to someone who has never been able <br/>\nto see.  Now that she can read, she understands phonics a little <br/>\nbetter.

If he is getting <br/>\nfrustrated help him.  Help him not get into situations that frustrate <br/>\nhim so much.  Read to him, always answer his request to read something <br/>\nfor him.  Listen to books on tape or cd.  I really can&#39;t stress that <br/>\nenough!  Chamille devoured books in that form, so that by the time she <br/>\nwas reading, she knew those words existed, she knew how sentences and <br/>\nideas strung together.

What helped her more than <br/>\nanything was the fact that book for book she had read more books on <br/>\ntape and cd and me reading to her, than most of her school aged peers.  <br/>\nLet your son know that reading will come, assure him and help him feel <br/>\nwhole and perfect just the way he is.  I remember telling Chamille many <br/>\ntimes that she DID know how to read, she just was still in the learning <br/>\nprocess of gathering words.  It helped to point out all the words that <br/>\nshe could read.<br/>\n<br/>\nWrite him little notes.  I went through the bathroom and made cute <br/>\nlittle signs for everything in there and stuck them to the objects.  <br/>\nFor a long time she saw those words every time she went into the <br/>\nbathroom.  I stickered everything with words, toilet, bathtub, mirror, <br/>\ndrawer, toothbursh, etc.  I did that because I knew she knew what those <br/>\nthings were and that she was a whole word learner, gathering words into <br/>\nher storage bank.  It helped her gather words faster.  She hardly ever <br/>\nasked more than once how to spell or read a word.  Once she knew it, <br/>\nshe knew it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously do EVERYthing in your power to eliminate frustration.

A couple of days ago he <br/>\ngathered up all the Asterix and Obelix comic books we have and put them in <br/>\nhis sleeping bag so that he could read through them with a flashlight. He <br/>\nworked through some of the words and looked at the pictures and sang some of <br/>\nthe words when the Gauls had a moment of drunken revelry. When he was 5 I <br/>\ncan remember reading books with him and pointing out words in text for him <br/>\nto read. When we read Noddy books I&#39;d have him find the words Big Ears as we <br/>\nread through. It didn&#39;t make a difference. Even the little dot-to-dots I <br/>\nused to do so that he could trace out the letters, it didn&#39;t make a <br/>\ndifference. His reading is going at his own pace. As is his writing. I don&#39;t <br/>\nthink there is anything that I could have done to push his reading on. And I <br/>\ncertainly don&#39;t think that the tricks I was doing when he was 5 did anything <br/>\nbut make him more reticent to explore reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve spent some time looking at the literacy statistics to underscore the <br/>\nlie that schooling can bring children to reading. Here is a table of <br/>\nproficiency across grade levels and years (from 1992 to 2005) that really <br/>\nshows how literacy isn&#39;t something that schooling can give your child: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2006/section2/table.asp?tableID=560\">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2006/section2/table.asp?tableID=560</a> And the <br/>\ninteresting thing is that betwen 4th and 12th grade the movement between <br/>\nproficiency levels is very slight, and certainly by 8th grade, in school, if <br/>\nyou aren&#39;t reading, you aren&#39;t going to read. But I bet there are instances <br/>\non this list of people whose children might not have been reading by 13, but <br/>\nby not being excluded or shamed or made to feel like a failure, a permanent <br/>\nnon-reader, they are reading by 15 or 16 or 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my own case relaxing about it made the biggest difference. I can&#39;t make <br/>\nSimon read. Having Linnaea read at 6 really demonstrated to me that it <br/>\nwasn&#39;t necessarily an environmental issue, its more likely a developmental <br/>\nissue. I can&#39;t change his development. I can only support him by reading to <br/>\nhim, by helping him to live in a world filled with text and words. There are <br/>\nthings that amaze me about him not reading. He remembers things like none of <br/>\nthe readers in our family do.

I would help your <br/>\nhusband to see how successfully he is negotiating the world, and how reading <br/>\nwill come. I would help him to get through the video games that require <br/>\nreading. Simon is amazingly confident in his not reading. He will ask <br/>\nfriends and adults and his younger sister to read for him without even a <br/>\nmoments embarrassment. I was woried when Linnaea began to read that it would <br/>\nmake Simon feel uncomfortable, or stupid. My fears were so misplaced.
