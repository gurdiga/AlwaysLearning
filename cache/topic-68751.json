A well established play group would have the same effect, but the process of establishing one can take longer. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;No input from the kids&quot; may not be as cut and dried as the perception from the outside, too.

But the success or failure of those sorts of things depend on them being responsive to the participants and thoughtful of their likes and interests. Sometimes people go to funshops (and camps) without a whole lot of interest in the activity itself, but very interested in the people there. If the goal of whoever is organizing things is to create lessons to educate people, that&#39;s a problem.

And sometimes one individual can change the perspective of a whole group. Like how divorce can be contagious, once someone starts talking about how their child has said they&#39;d be interested in doing a body of study this way the other members of the group may be looking more for those words from their children. And once they start looking they start hearing their children talking about wanting to do something and they hear them saying how they&#39;d like to do something more formally. So, they step away from some of those ideas they once embraced. They say that this body of study, these formal lessons are things the children have initiated. They are following the lead of their children. When really they are nervous and doubtful and suddenly are hoping that they can keep their children safe in a world that seems unknowable and maybe those French lessons they got once a week at<br/>\n their unschooling gathering will show them the light and they way and get them into a job or a university or a marriage. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe that isn&#39;t what&#39;s happening. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: Leigh DeVore &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:gaiablessed@...\">gaiablessed@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; <br/>\nSent: Friday, 24 August 2012, 12:08<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Structure<br/>\n <br/>\nNo, not here.
