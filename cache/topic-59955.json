I&#39;ve been asked to allow a post about ARGH through.  I don&#39;t, usually, because it&#39;s an international list, but that information is below.  There will not be follow-up information, so if you&#39;re near or interested in Tennessee, join the list linked below.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be a one-day conference in London on June 11 at which Schuyler Waynforth and I will both speak.  If you&#39;re interested, watch my speaking page ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/speaking\">http://sandradodd.com/speaking</a> ) for more details later about other speakers, place, time, cost, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be three peaceful, laid-back, serious-discussion symposia in Albuquerque, in late July 2011, late December 2011, and July 2012.  Early details are here:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/all\">http://sandradodd.com/all</a><br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nAttention!! Attention!!
