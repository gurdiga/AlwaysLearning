Wrap them with<br/>\na note saying these are great muggle candies. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did this--<br/>\na black satin bag with big fancy lemondrops, and a speech from Hagrid with <br/>\nthe presentation.  Thanks for the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt went pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurned out this was the birthday boy&#39;s 15 birthday, and most of the kids <br/>\nthere were 13-16.  Most had read the books, a few hadn&#39;t.  He had four <br/>\nsiblings, one older and three younger, and they each had a friend or two <br/>\nthere too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his pockets, &quot;Hagrid&quot; had a mostly-pink umbrella (pink and goldish brown, <br/>\nwhich I got for $3 from a thrift store, one broken spoke (whatever those <br/>\nthings are called), and it didn&#39;t show when it was in the pocket.   A <br/>\ndragon&#39;s egg in its own pocket, which he brought out a few times.  Candy, <br/>\nsausages (two kinds of small sausage which he had wrapped in paper towels to <br/>\nget some of the grease out, but then put them in unwrapped, with...), four <br/>\nrabbit-fur mice from the pet section (which he ended up giving away to <br/>\nteenaged girls), a squeaky animal of some gopher-looking sort (made sounds if <br/>\nyou squeezed it), ribbon candy, balls of leather strips, and maybe that&#39;s all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we first got there, it looked like there were uniformed waitresses.  <br/>\nThen we figured out the girls had dressed in their idea of school uniforms.  <br/>\nThey looked like Japanese animation schoolgirls--knee socks, dark <br/>\nmini-skirts, white blouses and soft bow ties.  Most of the boys were wearing <br/>\nwhite shirts, slacks and ties.  So the guests pulled their parts off pretty <br/>\nwell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe birthday boy thought he was coming to help some of the other teens cater <br/>\na party, because we were at a restaurant downtown, and several of his friends <br/>\nwork for a catering company, so not only was that plausible but they could <br/>\ntell HIM to wear a white shirt and tie!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he showed up, we were all there, the tables were set in a big U shape, <br/>\nwith a head chair in the center, and after &quot;surprise&quot; and a speech from <br/>\nHagrid:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve a message from Professor Dumbledore.<br/>\n<br/>\nFine man, Dumbledore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he sent a message.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he has been detained,<br/>\nat a meeting,<br/>\na really important meeting,<br/>\nat the ministry of Magic,<br/>\n         oh I probably shouldn&#39;t have said that...<br/>\n<br/>\nhe wishes for that young Peter whose birthday it is to preside over this meal <br/>\nin his stead.<br/>\n <br/>\n---------<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of that was said just like that, and then he said that the others would <br/>\nbe seated by the sorting hat. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo they had a chair and a hat, and it would say one of the four houses (to <br/>\nthe four tables coming down--two on one side and two on the other) or &quot;head <br/>\ntable.&quot;  Pretty much &quot;head table&quot; was the adults and Peter&#39;s best friends.  <br/>\nIt didn&#39;t work out perfectly, but fairly so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe room was big (a former storefront at 6th and Central/old Rt. 66, so nice <br/>\nceilings, fireplace, big water fall, forest of a dozen or more white-lit <br/>\nChristmas trees in the front window.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had to get them to turn the waterfall off so they could hear this part:  <br/>\nWhen they gathered to cut the cake, which was made by those aforementioned <br/>\ncatering teenagers, I made a speech (below), but before I asked Hagrid to <br/>\nhelp me out with his umbrella.  He stood on a chair and waved it and pointed <br/>\nat people far back, and I read this and then  rolled-up-and-tied-with-ribbon <br/>\ncopies were distributed out of a basket, to the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI told them I had a magical gift for Peter and a party favor for everyone <br/>\nthere, but they would have to listen because it worked with words and thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could make your entire lives easy and better, I would, but I can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for one year, I can give you this:  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe easy remembrance of joy and of duty.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you are muggle or wizard,<br/>\nwhatever house you&#39;re in at Hogwart&#39;s<br/>\nwhatever religion or belief you have,<br/>\nyour goal is the same:  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be a help to others and to appreciate the goodness around you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have opportunities every day to do good.<br/>\nYou have the ability to make other lives better along with your own,  <br/>\nToday; tonight; tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet trees remind you to live and breathe in the sky, not in the dust.<br/>\nLet the wind remind you that life moves us and changes us.<br/>\nLet the sunshine remind you that warmth flows through you and from you.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeet life with courage and conviction.<br/>\nBe a source of goodness and joy.<br/>\n-----------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was really well received, and kids were making sure they got copies and <br/>\nput them in a safe place.  I had expected more cynicism and less attention <br/>\nthan I got.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen we ate cake, hung out, went home.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh--I was wearing a long black dress and a witch&#39;s hat I made in 1978 or so, <br/>\nwhich has mostly lived in the kids&#39; costume box, but this year for Halloween <br/>\nit was refurbished and got a crescent-moon-motif  hatband.  I had a black <br/>\nbelt with a magnifying glass hanging from it, and carried a recorder and a <br/>\ngold-covered binder, in which were the trivia questions, the blessing bit <br/>\nabove, and the music from a Christmas performance years ago.  That&#39;s how I <br/>\nwas able to read my message without it being tacky--it was in the same book <br/>\nwe had used for the trivia contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was fun being in a place with Senator Domenici and being photographed more <br/>\nthan he was.  (There were few cameras; I couldn&#39;t find mine when we left, and <br/>\nmy friend Kathy had an electronic thing which wasn&#39;t working, but her <br/>\nsister-in-law took some and maybe someday I&#39;ll see one.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trivia questions were written first by Kathy (my friend Kathy, who&#39;s <br/>\nmarried to Pete Domenici Jr., but used to be married to another guy named <br/>\nHoag, and her oldest three kids were toddler and 6 when Kirby was born--she <br/>\nwas a LLL leader, and in the babysitting co-op we were in), but she hadn&#39;t <br/>\nread the books and the questions were pretty much unworkable so I redid and <br/>\nadded, late Sunday afternoon.  But she did come up with some good loot to <br/>\ngive people who answered them correctly.    Because of the size and noise <br/>\nfactor in the room, we were able to ask some to a house on one side of the <br/>\nroom, and those on the other side hadn&#39;t heard.  We had Gringotts with <br/>\nbubblegum in them (they came in bags, but we broke out about ten bags of <br/>\nthem; Holly inherited the bags) and some wands full of candy).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe birthday boy was the expert, all said, so we didn&#39;t let him answer most <br/>\nof the time, but he was the one to get the hardest question.  We asked the <br/>\nwhole room and he was the only one who know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we distributed the last of the cool gum-coins so that everyone got at <br/>\nleast one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nHarry Potter Trivia<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHarry had no idea his parents had left him money.<br/>\nWhat is the name of the bank is kept? <br/>\n    Gringotts<br/>\n<br/>\nWho runs Gringotts? <br/>\n    Goblins<br/>\n<br/>\nName one kind of Wizard candy Harry bought on the train.<br/>\n    Wizards, Bertie’s Bott’s every flavor beans, Chocolate frogs<br/>\n    Licorice wands, Cauldron Cakes, Pumpkin Pasties<br/>\n    Droobles Best Blowing Gum<br/>\n<br/>\nName another one<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the train platform # Harry had to find? <br/>\n    9 3/4<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Harry’s owl’s name? <br/>\n    Hedwig<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat two of the four houses? <br/>\n    Hufflepuff, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor<br/>\n<br/>\nName the other two.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Harry’s cousin’s name? <br/>\n    Dudley Dursley<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Harry’s Aunt’s name? <br/>\n    Petunia<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Harry’s Uncle’s name? <br/>\n    Vernon<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere do the students go to buy their school supplies?<br/>\n    Diagon Alley<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are the non-magic folk called? <br/>\n    Muggles<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy was the ghost named Nicholas De Mimsy-Porpington not allowed to attend <br/>\nthe Headless Ghosts Ball?  <br/>\n    He’s only “Nearly Headless” Nick<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Hagrid’s own dog’s name?<br/>\n    Fang<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Harry’s position in Quidditch? <br/>\n    Seeker<br/>\n<br/>\nName any other position:  <br/>\n    Keeper, Chaser or Beater<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich ball is the seeker after? <br/>\n    Golden Snitch<br/>\n<br/>\nName another ball:  <br/>\n    Quaffle  or Bludger <br/>\n<br/>\nName a model of Quidditch broom:<br/>\n    Nimbus 2000, the Nimbus 2001  or Firebolt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe school motto of Hogwarts is means something like “Let sleeping dogs <br/>\nlie,” but that’s not exactly how they say it.
