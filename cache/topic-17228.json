We all have to keep reminding them <br/>\nthat someday, they&#39;ll be the ones who need our care and they should <br/>\neither find some compassion or put her in a nursing home.  It&#39;s very <br/>\nsad.  So I wish you lots of energy and emotional strength to get through <br/>\nthis time.  You really are doing the right thing.  How wonderful to have <br/>\nthe opportunity to show Kirby, Marty, and Holly how forgiveness and <br/>\ncompassion can shape a person&#39;s character. Everything my parents do for <br/>\nmy grandmother is done with seething resentment and  I hate that my <br/>\nchildren have to see and hear that.    Good luck.
