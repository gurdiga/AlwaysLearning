One teen said that parents <br/>\nshould support their children&#39;s passions even if they are uncomfortable with <br/>\nthat passion, even if the kid wants to be a tattoo artist or a burlesque dancer <br/>\nand went on to expand on how a parent who might be uncomfortable with those <br/>\npassions could find value in them and be supportive.  One parent in the audience <br/>\nfirmly stated that she didn&#39;t agree with that at all, that as a parent, she had <br/>\nthe right and responsibility to not support a passion she didn&#39;t agree with and <br/>\nthat she, as that parent, should make sure that her child knew why she wasn&#39;t <br/>\nsupportive of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was almost an audible gasp from the row of teens, the tension immediately <br/>\nsky rocketed.  You could FEEL IT.  The rest of the discussion went in the <br/>\ndirection of trusting and supporting passions.  These kids had no attachment to <br/>\nthat parent, yet each and everyone one of those teens could feel what that <br/>\nfeeling was so intensely that every person in that entire room could feel it. <br/>\n Imagine if that were you and your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that moment where you choose to devalue your child&#39;s interest, FEEL what that <br/>\nmight feel like to that child.  Even if you, as the parent, believe that you are <br/>\nvery very right about what you believe, your child is a different person who <br/>\njust might have other ideas of what is right.  Even if they decide that they <br/>\nweren&#39;t right, it is so much better to find that out for oneself than to have <br/>\nsomeone else say or even think &quot;I told you so&quot;.  As a parent knowing that you <br/>\n&quot;told them so&quot; feels awful, it just does.  Sometimes feeling or being right <br/>\nabout something sucks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is a possibility that it just might suck in the end, wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>\nbetter that the one part about it that doesn&#39;t suck is your relationship with <br/>\nyour kid?  The teens were awesome at talking about this topic!  They very <br/>\nbluntly said that, sure any parent can tell their kid that they won&#39;t support <br/>\nsomething, but what gets lost is the trust in the relationship.  We get to make <br/>\nchoices.  Parents can make choices about whether or not they will support <br/>\nsomething or not, but in the end, the part that really makes the difference is <br/>\nthe relationship.  There were 2 teens there, whose father was in the audience, <br/>\nso they put him on the spot a little bit (it was their mom that was supposed to <br/>\nhave hosted the chat) and brought up one time that one of them hadn&#39;t felt <br/>\nsupported in something and why and how and all 3 of them explained how that <br/>\nworked, how they handled that and how they do better with it now.  He was very <br/>\ngracious about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGracious is a good word there!  We WANT to be gracious with our kids!  Finding <br/>\nways to support our kids in what they want to do, even if it makes us terribly <br/>\nuncomfortable, is so earth shatteringly mind changing that you can&#39;t help but <br/>\ngrow as a person to do it.  We get to learn how to be better people because of <br/>\nour kids and that is awesome and our kids can reap the benefits of that in huge <br/>\nlife transforming ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven&#39;t read what led up to this conversation, so I hope that I haven&#39;t taken <br/>\nthis totally off topic here!

If somebody is sitting around waiting for their kids to find things to do and are happy when the kids succeed, that isn’t finding little paths and it also isn’t looking at current interests.

I do lots of strewing and have lots of cool stuff around my house. I give them lots of opportunities to do stuff but I am not necessarily looking for little paths. My 6 year old is really interested in Pokemon so I get everything that I can find related to Pokemon. I try to keep track of the time so that I can tell her when it will be on TV because she gets busy and forgets. If a new game comes out, we get it for her. I am very happy when my child discovers the cool stuff and plays with it or uses it. I feel like a lot of my time and energy is put into making sure that there are lots of things around the house that the kids will like and enjoy. In order to do that, I need to know what their interests are. There are some things that I would not get because I know that my kids do not like those things and would be offended if I brought them into the house because it would mean that I had completely ignored who they are and what their interests are.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling ideas","postDate":"1306860960","msgId":61357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRERTUxREEwLjMwMjA2MDZAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlzMGtxMCtsbjVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlzMGtxMCtsbjVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61354,"nextInTopic":61358,"prevInTime":61356,"nextInTime":61358,"topicId":61327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When you refuse to <br/>\naccept something, you sacrifice your peace.<br/>\nNon-acceptance creates resistance and shifts your focus away from what you want, <br/>\ntoward what you don&#39;t want.<br/>\nCan you see, then, how you disempower and undermine yourself when you deem your <br/>\nchild&#39;s behavior &quot;unacceptable&quot;?<br/>\nBut acceptance is not the same as tolerance. It&#39;s entirely possible to accept <br/>\nsomething while choosing not to tolerate it. For example, if your child were <br/>\ntrying to hit you, you could accept (make peace with) that — even while using <br/>\nprotective force to prevent the hitting.<br/>\nThe difference is how you feel in the process:<br/>\n\t* Tolerance without acceptance leads to resentment.<br/>\n\t* Tolerance with acceptance leads to appreciation.<br/>\n\t* INtolerance without acceptance leads to conflict.<br/>\n\t* INtolerance with acceptance leads to creativity.<br/>\nIn other words, when you accept What Is — AND you&#39;re clear that you want a <br/>\nchange — it&#39;s easy to solve problems creatively.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example, I have decided to accept (rather than not accept) that my 5yo <br/>\ndaughter has a volatile temper and work with her on better ways to respond to <br/>\nupsetting situations. However, I don&#39;t/will not tolerate her hitting, pushing, <br/>\nbiting her brothers or me when she is angry, frustrated, or feeling anxious. My <br/>\nintolerance leads to finding different ways for both of us to respond, yet I am <br/>\nnot judging her temper.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe using these two words would help parents struggling with accepting their <br/>\nchildren for who they are better deal with such feelings of wanting to change <br/>\nwhat is.

She went to 2nd grade for 2 months and her handwriting  <br/>\nimproved but when she quit, her handwriting went back to the way she  <br/>\nwas familiar with. Fortunately it didn&#39;t make me think she was now  <br/>\nstuck with bad habits and I was bad for not correcting her earlier ;-)  <br/>\nIt made me realize that what was important to her was getting the  <br/>\nwords in her head down on paper. What she needed was for the process  <br/>\n(of writing) not to get in the way. And what didn&#39;t get in the way was  <br/>\n*her* way of writing. It was familiar and didn&#39;t intrude on her  <br/>\nconsciousness. And I knew when *she* needed to form letters more  <br/>\nefficiently, she&#39;d seek out how to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) On a walk one day -- years before I found unschooling -- a mom was  <br/>\nfollowing her child on his tricycle. He was sitting and scooting  <br/>\nalong, pushing with his feet rather than using the pedals. She made  <br/>\nthe comment as I strolled by that she wished he would use the pedals.  <br/>\nShe was watching him do what to her looked unnecessarily hard and  <br/>\nwanted him to have a better way. But for *him* that was a better way.  <br/>\nOr funner :-) (Which can be the same thing!) It could be his legs were  <br/>\ntoo short to use the pedals well. It could be scooting was what felt  <br/>\nright. I don&#39;t think I said anything wise but it was one of those  <br/>\ndefining moments that sowed the seeds of understanding how two people  <br/>\ncan have different views and yet both be right -- right for themselves  <br/>\nbut wrong for the other person.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Kathryn was on the high school cross country team. She loves  <br/>\nrunning and has a lot of natural talent, meaning she did well without  <br/>\npushing herself. From Carl&#39;s point of view, anyone with what she had  <br/>\nobviously wanted to shoot for beating her own and others&#39; times. He  <br/>\nwanted the best for her :-) So he helped her train. If someone has a  <br/>\ngoal it can help to have someone pushing you *in ways you want to go*.  <br/>\nShe didn&#39;t know what she loved about running so his goal for her felt  <br/>\nlike a good idea. His enthusiasm was infectious. But as she went  <br/>\nalong, she realized that *for her* the goal was a run that felt good.  <br/>\nIf she was running for the sake of times, then a good run might  <br/>\nactually be a failure. For her father, not hitting the mark meant  <br/>\nfiguring out how to do better next time. For Kathryn, the mark was an  <br/>\nenjoyable run. Even though Carl wanted the &quot;best&quot; for her, what she  <br/>\nreally needed was help with *her* definition of best, not *his*  <br/>\ndefinition of best.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccept that your &quot;right&quot; way may be wrong for them. Then it will be  <br/>\neasier to make suggestions of a way that might be helpful or easier  <br/>\nbut  also help you detach from your way being THE right way, help you  <br/>\nnot be invested in they adopting your &quot;right&quot; way. One day it may be  <br/>\nright for them. Or it may not be because they want something different  <br/>\nthat your way won&#39;t help them get but their way will.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTWO:<br/>\n*If they are unhappy*, focus on what the child&#39;s trying to do rather  <br/>\nthan on the child. Look at yourself and how your reactions might be  <br/>\nmaking it worse. Look at the environment and whether that can be  <br/>\nchanged for avoided. What can you change? What obstacles can you  <br/>\nremove? What can you bring to them? How can you avoid adding further  <br/>\nnegative emotion? If it&#39;s an ongoing problem, ask on the list for some  <br/>\nobjectivity :-) If it&#39;s in the moment and you can&#39;t figure out how to  <br/>\ndo better, being there for a hug of understanding and acceptance that  <br/>\nthis is difficult is a really great response and may be all they need.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome examples:<br/>\nSometimes kids get wound up by intense hours of video games. The  <br/>\nconventional approach is cut short the video games. But that doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp kids be happier in what their doing. (How to help them depends on  <br/>\nthe child. It might be bringing them food. Being aware of stopping  <br/>\npoints and offering physical movement. Part is offering ideas. Part is  <br/>\ntrusting they want to be happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome kids are highly sensitive. It seems loving to wish they were less  <br/>\nsensitive. It seems loving to want to work on decreasing their  <br/>\nsensitivity. But that sensitivity is part of who they are right now.  <br/>\nWhat they need are ways to live as sensitive people in the world.  <br/>\nThink about how frustrating it would be if your arm were broken and  <br/>\nyour husband&#39;s &quot;solution&quot; was to wish your arm weren&#39;t broken! Well,  <br/>\nyeah, gee, big help there! ;-) But what if, instead, he did for you  <br/>\nwhat you couldn&#39;t right now? What if he found clever ways to make what  <br/>\nyou wanted to do easy to do with a broken arm?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHREE:<br/>\n*If they are making others unhappy*, stop the child! Kids need a big  <br/>\nclear message of &quot;No, not good.&quot; They don&#39;t necessarily need to  <br/>\nunderstand why! They won&#39;t necessarily not do it again. But they need  <br/>\nto feel &quot;That&#39;s not an acceptable solution. Let&#39;s try something else.&quot;  <br/>\nAnd then move on to the *real* problem. Rather than focus on them  <br/>\nunderstanding why those solutions are bad, focus on what your child is  <br/>\ntrying to do and help them. Assume that your child is doing the best  <br/>\nthey can and come up with *better* solutions than the ones your child  <br/>\nis trying. *Be* the better solution. (Eg, say &quot;Thank you&quot; for them  <br/>\ninstead of making them.) Also accept that your child may not be ready  <br/>\nfor the situation. If they keep making choices that upset others,  <br/>\nthey&#39;re not ready. And they need to be kept out of the situation until  <br/>\nthey&#39;re older and you can try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are better examples and more that can be said about 2 and  <br/>\n3 but I&#39;ve run out of time! Hopefully others can flesh them out. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling ideas","postDate":"1306777216","msgId":61343,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlzMGtxMCtsbjVuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PFNOVDE0Mi13NjVDQjc5QjA2Mzk4QTdFNUMwQjVCNkEwNzgwQHBoeC5nYmw+"},"prevInTopic":61340,"nextInTopic":61353,"prevInTime":61342,"nextInTime":61344,"topicId":61327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ****************** You don t need to be looking for little paths that lead off so much as looking for what interests your kids right now.

If its Minecraft that&#39;s fine. It doesn&#39;t have to &quot;lead&quot; to something that looks educational for your kids to be learning a whole lot from what they&#39;re doing. They might find Minecraft inspires them to do something else or not. You might find a related game or movie or graphic novel they enjoy. Or Minecraft might be enough in and of itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where unschooling is different from an educational method, per se. An interest or passion doesn&#39;t have to have &quot;tie ins&quot; to other &quot;subjects&quot; in order to be valuable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t believe the adage, &quot;get anything in a kid&#39;s hand to get them reading&quot;,<br/>\n </span></blockquote>but I do believe that it is okay if the newer titles feed their reading<br/>\ninterests<br/>\n****************<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to shock you - reading is a useful skill, but that&#39;s all. It doesn&#39;t matter if kids or adults enjoy it, if they ever want to read for fun. Not important. Kids will learn to read for the utility of it the same way Americans learn to drive for the utility of it. I drive almost every day, but I can&#39;t say I enjoy it. It&#39;s a useful skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in that sense, it really doesn&#39;t matter what they read so long as they are reading for their own reasons. Forget &quot;newer titles&quot; - I&#39;m talking about letting go of the idea that the purpose of reading is to read books. Plenty of adults live happy, meaningful, culturally rich lives without touching books - but they may read magazines, instructions, and web pages. They may go to plays, concerts and poetry slams. They may be artists, themselves - all without ever diving into a book for pleasure. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich isn&#39;t to say books are somehow evil - no more than is tv ;) And there&#39;s nothing *wrong* with reading for pleasure. Hanging on to the idea that people *should* read books in general and certain books in particular is limiting, though. The world of knowledge and artistry is much, much bigger than that. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling ideas","postDate":"1306749354","msgId":61340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDMTQxQkJFLTNGRjAtNEYxNy1CODY5LURGQjQyMjNGRjYyN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PFNOVDE0Mi13NjVDQjc5QjA2Mzk4QTdFNUMwQjVCNkEwNzgwQHBoeC5nYmw+","referencesHeader":"PGlydGp0cSs3OXUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiwgPGlydHVkaStubnFrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8U05UMTQyLXc2NUNCNzlCMDYzOThBN0U1QzBCNUI2QTA3ODBAcGh4LmdibD4="},"prevInTopic":61337,"nextInTopic":61343,"prevInTime":61339,"nextInTime":61341,"topicId":61327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I used to be a branch librarian until the kids started getting older and we needed to focus more on the older kids&#39; education (ha ha!).  Anyway, at that time we were in a school group that was basically &quot;run&quot; by one very vocal woman, and her similarly very local children.  Not only were they unhappy that the librarians of our county hadn&#39;t read EVERY book in the buildings (seriously??  Do all patrons believe that??), but they really felt they were far superior because they read all the &quot;great&quot; books of the ages.  When my kids balked at deep reading--it hurt me on two levels at first:  being a librarian, I was exposed to so much I THOUGHT they&#39;d love at the time!  LOL!  The other reason:  my pride in having to admit to this very vocal, very arrogant woman that my kids didn&#39;t love to read at every spare moment.  This family actually did base their &quot;friends&quot; on how much they read.  Now, I have come to the conclusion that it is okay that some of my kids learn by doing, seeing, hearing rather than by reading each book--&quot;fine literature&quot; or not.  But that line in &quot;Matilda&quot; (the movie--gasp!), where Danny Devito says, &quot;There is nothing in a book you can&#39;t learn faster from TV&quot;, does haunt me sometimes--ha ha!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe the adage, &quot;get anything in a kid&#39;s hand to get them reading&quot;, but I do believe that it is okay if the newer titles feed their reading interests.

He saw me, and excitedly asked me if I wanted to draw with him - his way. In accepting this, I learned more about what he was seeing and thinking than I ever could have (or did) trying to get him to draw or paint something I planned for him.

What I see is that I have been happy when they have found something to do, but I haven&#39;t helped them find the little paths that led off.  So that suggestion is really good.  We have always followed attachment parenting with our babies and toddlers, but I think because my parents were pretty uninvolved once we got school age, I have done the same thing, hoping to lead them to be more independent.  Funny, because I see as an adult, sometimes my own independence (think of a 2 year old:  &quot;MY way!&quot;  LOL!) has not always been positive in the way that I don&#39;t allow too many people into my world (okay, I admit I ran into trust issues as a child, and that didn&#39;t help!

But letting go of that idea helped me let go of wanting to push &quot;literature&quot; at my kids and instead value what They want to read or watch or play. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that being said, Sandra Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling is a good one to pick up and put down *and* a great source of ideas, information and inspiration. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/bigbook/\">http://sandradodd.com/bigbook/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother easy unschooling read is Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child- its in a Q&A format, which again makes it easy to pick up and put down:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.freechild.info/\">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling ideas","postDate":"1306690579","msgId":61332,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY2MTgxQ0E0Rjc3MDQ3OEU5MEQ5OUZFQ0ZBMkY5QzRCQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlydGp0cSs3OXUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8RkY5QkQ0NzItODYxQi00MjMzLTk2OTYtMjBBNEQ3MkY5MTBDQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61331,"nextInTopic":61333,"prevInTime":61331,"nextInTime":61333,"topicId":61327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I think the webpages are better than any one book.

I don&#39;t mean leading your children&#39;s play, or leaving your children to play while you make yourself available while you pursue your interests.  I tried both of those and found I lost my connection with my son each time.  What works well for me, is to really get in there and be with him...play his games with him the way he likes to play them, so that I can understand what he is doing and why.  Then I can add to our days things that might lead us on tangents relative to where we are.  For example, recently we have been playing Minecraft together.  He loves the mining.  He gets so excited when he finds gold, diamond and obsidian.  The next time we stopped briefly at the library, I asked if he wanted to look at books with gold, diamond and obsidian in them.  He literally jumped up and down with excitement at that idea, and we ended up taking out a huge stack of books on all kinds of mining and earth related topics.  He picked them all out, although we searched for them together.  At home I left them on tables, where he and I look at them when we were eating, or transitioning, or whatever.  Later, we watched a video about volcanos, and looked through a collection of rocks in a box that I have been adding to over the years which included lava rock, basalt, obsidian and pumice.  Again, he was thrilled, but none of  this wouldn&#39;t have worked if I had chosen some topic without knowing where his interests were.  This also wouldn&#39;t have happened if I hadn&#39;t spent a good amount of time mining with him :) <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Thanks for ideas--which I really enjoy, whether it is related to schooling, gardening, crafting, etc.--I love to learn new things.

LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What has been difficult for me is to accept that the things I find really interesting might not interest my son in the same way they do me.  I love painting and drawing, and for a long time I would try to get him to join me, my way, in these activities.  It never really worked.  Recently, my son went into my art room and sat at the table drawing pages of game tiles and plans for a game he was making up.  Again, there were many different kinds of rocks and minerals and textures related to our recent interests.  The tiles were so detailed and interestingly laid out on the page.  He saw me, and excitedly asked me if I wanted to draw with him - his way.  In accepting this, I learned more about what he was seeing and thinking than I ever could have (or did) trying to get him to draw or paint something I planned for him.  And, I discovered he does like to draw - his things, his way!  I suspect the same is very true for your kids.  They will really enjoy what *they* really enjoy, especially when they know you support them and might even join them!  <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":342163414,"authorName":"Chris Sanders","from":"Chris Sanders &lt;iowaunschoolers@...&gt;","profile":"iaunschoolers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling ideas","postDate":"1306679858","msgId":61329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNBNzNGRTIwLTNDODEtNDZCOC1CRjlBLTc4QkU0QjkxQzQ0NEBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlydGp0cSs3OXUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlydGp0cSs3OXUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61328,"nextInTopic":61331,"prevInTime":61328,"nextInTime":61330,"topicId":61327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Watch movies together, surf YouTube for funny videos, cute animal videos, old music videos -- whatever they might enjoy.  Go places together -- Is it spring weather where you are?  Get out together -- take a hike, go to public gardens, do geocaching, go to science centers/museums, spring festivals, concerts, farmer&#39;s markets etc.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks for ideas--which I really enjoy, whether it is related to schooling, gardening, crafting, etc.--I love to learn new things.

They may need some time to deschool - the general rule thumb is at least one month for each year they were schooled -- even counting structured HOME schooling.  During this time is a good time for you to read and research about unschooling, find other local unschoolers to connect with, make easy-to-eat, tasty foods for your kids to enjoy when their hungry.  Work on finding ways to say &quot;yes&quot; more to your kids and yourself for that matter.  &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nChris<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling ideas","postDate":"1306679785","msgId":61328,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZGOUJENDcyLTg2MUItNDIzMy05Njk2LTIwQTRENzJGOTEwQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlydGp0cSs3OXUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGlydGp0cSs3OXUyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61327,"nextInTopic":61329,"prevInTime":61327,"nextInTime":61329,"topicId":61327,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-What are some of your favorite books to jumpstart homeschooling?-=- Used to be Teach Your Own by John Holt, but it s quite outdated now, and the updated one","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1144745042\">-=-What are some of your favorite books to jumpstart homeschooling?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUsed to be Teach Your Own by John Holt, but it&#39;s quite outdated now, and the updated one (reedited by someone else) isn&#39;t better than the original.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the webpages are better than any one book.
