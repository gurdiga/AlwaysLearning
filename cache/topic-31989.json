I had a  <br/>\ndiscussion with the dad on public property (a vacant lot near both  <br/>\nour houses where he won the insulting half, but I won the &quot;make you  <br/>\nafraid not to change&quot; half.  I&#39;ve yelled over the back fence &quot;BE NICE  <br/>\nTO THEM!!!&quot; when the grandmother was ragging and raging to the  <br/>\ntoddlers, and I&#39;ve yelled &quot;BE QUIET&quot; when they were just ragging and  <br/>\nraging at each other.  And y&#39;know what?  They do get quieter and  <br/>\nnicer.  The police are there lots, and I&#39;ve only called them once,  <br/>\nwhen a teenaged girl was screaming and crying for someone not to hit  <br/>\nher.  They&#39;ve looked for the dad with a helicopter.  The county made  <br/>\nthem move out until the house was repaired.

Our most beautiful little side yard is now the property  <br/>\nof their barking German Shepherd.  It&#39;s not fun for us to work over  <br/>\nthere, even.  And we could befriend or bribe the dog, but his barking  <br/>\nis always followed closely by one of them yelling at her to &#39;shut up,  <br/>\ngod damn it.&#39;  I&#39;m glad we&#39;re not having to watch them raise kids.   <br/>\nThey won&#39;t even let their dog be a natural dog.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is way, way more important than that:<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t dwell in those thoughts.

For me, being rude back would just not <br/>\nwork, because that&#39;s not who I am, and that&#39;s not who I want to be; I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t want to pull that off.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would do is point out to my son that sometimes folks will put <br/>\nother people down to build themselves up.  Folks who need to do that <br/>\ngenerally don&#39;t feel too good about themselves, and that&#39;s why they <br/>\ndo it.  That&#39;s pretty sad.  I would help my son see that it&#39;s not <br/>\nabout long hair or anything that is wrong with my son but it&#39;s *that* <br/>\nguy&#39;s messed up view of himself that is probably the root of his rudeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile honoring and helping my son deal with his hurt feelings, I <br/>\nwould also be transparent for my son about my holding compassion and <br/>\nforgiveness in my heart for this jerk.  (What I wouldn&#39;t do is tell <br/>\nmy son that he should do that, too, unless he asked me specifically <br/>\nwhat I thought he should do, and even then, I would help him figure <br/>\nout his own way, which never, ever has to be my way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be interesting, too, almost like an experiment, to see if <br/>\nthis unspoken compassion I felt in my heart had any effect on that <br/>\nguy, too.  It would be interesting to see if he stopped showing up in <br/>\nour lives or just ignored us as we walked by.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, my husband, Jimmy, actually had that experience with <br/>\nsomeone.  There was a guy who ran the local recycling center, and he <br/>\nwas *always* busting Jimmy&#39;s chops and my son&#39;s chops, too.  It was <br/>\nannoying and confounding.  Eventually, Jimmy changed the way he was <br/>\nfeeling in his heart, and I swear that guy never even noticed Jimmy <br/>\nand Liam after that.  The change in this guy was abrupt!  It was <br/>\nquite weird and very cool!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s what I&#39;d do.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140885507,"authorName":"Kathleen Gehrke","from":"&quot;Kathleen Gehrke&quot; &lt;gehrkes@...&gt;","profile":"gehrkes","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Remark from a jerk","postDate":"1202346132","msgId":31990,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZvZGxhaytyNnAyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGZvZGtkNyt2a2pmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":31989,"nextInTopic":31991,"prevInTime":31989,"nextInTime":31991,"topicId":31989,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think lots of times guys like these are trying in their twisted ways to be, you know ,friendly.
