VERY nice.   Then I was putting it on <br/>\nwhen I would get up in the morning, but yesterday morning Keith (who HAD been <br/>\nencouraging caution) talked me into trying to walk without it, just to the <br/>\ntoilet (not far, and on carpet).  It was scary but worked okay.  So this <br/>\nmorning I walked a long way before I found a warm place to sit and put the <br/>\nbrace on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two incision-scars (I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called at this stage <br/>\nof healing).  The one on the outside is straight and healed up quietly and <br/>\nnicely.  The one on the inside of the ankle is curved (like an arc around the <br/>\nheel) and doesn&#39;t feel good.  It&#39;s sensitive and for a while it was opened a <br/>\nlittle and oozy/yucky.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe brace doesn&#39;t hurt at all anymore.  I can zip around pretty well, and <br/>\nwalk on uneven ground.  I walked to Hollywood Video Thursday, a few hundred <br/>\nyards.  I stayed on pavement, though.  The half-a-dozen kids who walked with <br/>\nme only got ahead of me once.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first got the brace I thought I&#39;d be walking quicker and better.  So <br/>\nwhen they say &quot;take it off&quot; on Tuesday (which I figure they will, after they <br/>\nsee the x-rays), then I will probably put it right back on to walk out to the <br/>\ncar, and build up to walking without it gradually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be able to drive.  Pushing the gas would be fine, but <br/>\nthe possibility of having to slam the brake on would not seem safe to me <br/>\nright now.  I&#39;ll talk to them about that Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, my two boys are entrapped at Walmart with their friend Bret.  They <br/>\nwent to get an antenna for a radio, and Bret locked the keys in his truck.  <br/>\nThat wouldn&#39;t be so bad, except two other teens were waiting here at the <br/>\nhouse to surprise Marty with a Playstation game one had bought used for him.  <br/>\n(It&#39;s the same one Keith and I bought NEW for him, last night, but we have <br/>\nthe receipt--it&#39;s already giftwrapped, but Marty can open it tonight and then <br/>\nwe can take it back and get him a different game before his birthday on the <br/>\n14th.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo...  a few phone calls back and forth, and the two here decided to go on to <br/>\nanother house and not wait.  That&#39;s good, because not only was Bret&#39;s mom <br/>\nbringing extra keys from Stanley, NM (40  miles to the east).  The boys <br/>\ndecided to wait in Wendy&#39;s where it was warmer instead of getting my husband <br/>\nto pick them up.   But before Bret&#39;s mom got there, somehow and for some <br/>\nreason Kirby doesn&#39;t know (bomb threat, he thought he heard maybe) the entire <br/>\nWalmart parking lot was closed.  This is a 24-hour super walmart, and Kirby <br/>\nsaid there are police cars at every exit, not letting any cars in or out.  <br/>\nBret&#39;s mom walked in.  I asked if they wanted to walk out and get Keith to <br/>\npick them up, but they said they&#39;re having fun besieged at Wendy&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nBret will take them by Eric&#39;s house and Marty can get the happy surprise <br/>\ngift, IF the police open the parking lot before long.  It&#39;s already 9:25 p.m.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnplanned adventures make the best memories.<br/>\nI hope the police barricade doesn&#39;t have to do with any real harm to anyone, <br/>\nthough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11387,"nextTopicId":11406}}
