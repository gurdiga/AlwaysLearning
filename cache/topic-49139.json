She ran downstairs, got the ornament from it&#39;s hiding place and brought it to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nI called the hotel today and the receptionist (who probably didn&#39;t feel like she had the authority to give away the ornament) told me that I could bring it back the next time I was in Quito.

Is &#39;wrong&#39; the<br/>\n&gt; wrong word? -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If anything has ever been wrong, stealing is wrong.  Stealing is  <br/>\n&gt; generally a greater crime than killing someone, because killing has  <br/>\n&gt; lots of justifications.  Theft has few to none.  Stealing has been a  <br/>\n&gt; crime since caveman days, no doubt.  And then comes culture, which  <br/>\n&gt; involves some people claiming ownership over group-acquired or - <br/>\n&gt; created things, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother topic. Just pointing out  <br/>\n&gt; that I&#39;m not trying to make a statement out of simplistic ignorance.   <br/>\n&gt; (My ignorance is more complex... &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Any child who has ever owned something knows that it would be wrong  <br/>\n&gt; for someone else to take it.<br/>\n&gt; Any parent who says &quot;this is yours&quot; and then takes it away from the  <br/>\n&gt; child (to trash it secretly as my mom used to do to things, or to  <br/>\n&gt; withhold it as punishment, or to let siblings play with it over the  <br/>\n&gt; protests of the owner) is creating a sneak thief.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If I had wanted to train my children to be thieves (as a neighbor who  <br/>\n&gt; used to live behind me did) I could have done that.  Treating them  <br/>\n&gt; cruelly helps.  It makes them needy.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But that doesn&#39;t apply in the case of this Christmas ornament.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The reason I recommended calling the hotel applies because it&#39;s a  <br/>\n&gt; hotel.  They woulnn&#39;t put family heirloom ornaments on a tree in a  <br/>\n&gt; public place.  It&#39;s difficult to mail things the week before  <br/>\n&gt; Christmas.  They might rather have cash.  They might not even save  <br/>\n&gt; those ornaments from year to year but might say &quot;Oh, keep it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; If one of my children stole an ornament from a private home, I would  <br/>\n&gt; definitely send it back and not even consider offering to buy it.   <br/>\n&gt; People&#39;s ornaments on their own trees in their own homes probably have  <br/>\n&gt; sentimental value.

They <br/>\nwere small - bobby pin size. So I proceeded to search through all the dress <br/>\nup stuff and all over where they had been playing. I looked under the sofa <br/>\nand the sofa pillows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a feeling from the way Jayn was kinda looking odd and trying to <br/>\nencourage her friend to leave (very unusual) that she had taken them, but I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t be sure. I figured I would have to go through her stuff later - <br/>\nwhich is a pretty large undertaking. I took her aside and asked her a couple <br/>\nof times is she knew where they were and wanted to get them, but she denied <br/>\nknowing where they were.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, after probably a good 40 minutes of really picking through <br/>\neverything they had played with in the course of the playdate, R started <br/>\ngetting pretty teary. I assured her that I wouldn&#39;t stop searching until I <br/>\nfound them, even if she went home. Jayn tried to cheer her up by drawing her <br/>\na picture, but she wasn&#39;t to be consoled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly Jayn looked at her and seemed to really notice how sad she was. <br/>\nJayn asked her something like &quot;Are you really that upset?&quot; and her friend <br/>\nsaid, &quot;Yes&quot;. Then Jayn turned and went into her room and a moment later came <br/>\nout with the two pins which she had hidden. She handed them back to her <br/>\nfriend and said she was sorry, and asked if R felt better now.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer friend was pretty surprised and said something like, &quot;You liked them so <br/>\nyou just took them to keep?&quot; and I said something like, &quot;I thought it might <br/>\nhave been that.&quot; I told Jayn that I was proud of her for giving the pins <br/>\nback, and she told me that she didn&#39;t like to see her friend so sad. I also <br/>\ntold Jayn that if she saw something that belonged to somone else that she <br/>\nliked and wanted, to tell me so that I could try to get another for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am proud of Jayn for coming to that decision herself, and the reason she <br/>\nreturned the pins too. It was helpful for her to see that taking something <br/>\nnot her own affects other people directly. This time it was very personal, <br/>\nbut the principle that others can be hurt by theft is applicable to any <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the girl was a bit surprised that I wasn&#39;t punishing Jayn. That same <br/>\nlittle girl had some (quite a few) months earlier taken my diamond ring from <br/>\nthe bathroom and hidden it in her own jewelry box at home. The girls had <br/>\nbeen playing dress up and makeovers, and Jayn had shown R. the ring earlier <br/>\nwith my permission.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until after she had gone home and I happened to go into the <br/>\nbathroom that I noticed the ring was gone. I asked Jayn about it, but she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t know where it was. So I thought about it and called R&#39;s mom. I tried <br/>\nto be very gentle wondering if R had accidentally worn my ring home, and <br/>\nsaid something about how she might have forgotten that she had the ring on <br/>\nbecause they had been trying on different bits and pieces of jewelry playing <br/>\ndress up, trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few minutes later R. came back with the ring looking very hangdog and <br/>\ndown. I&#39;m pretty sure she had been spanked and was probably looking forward <br/>\nto being grounded or other punishments. Her mom had gone through the jewelry <br/>\nbox, and apparently she had tried to tell some malarkey about thinking it <br/>\nwas her aunt&#39;s ring in the box. I wish I had gone to the door instead, <br/>\nbecause then I could have asked to speak to R directly and given her the <br/>\nchance to give it to me and avoid what was probably excessive (IMO) <br/>\npunishments.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have also been the victim of theft, specifically with our car being <br/>\nbroken into more than once. Recently my GPS navigator was stolen after the <br/>\nwindow was smashed. This was inconvenient and ended up being costly, and had <br/>\na direct effect on Jayn&#39;s comfort - so now she has that added layer of <br/>\ninformation to add to her world view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the contrast of the two different ways of handling relatively <br/>\nsimilar situations might be useful to someone. I can tell you that Jayn has <br/>\nnever stolen anything else since, to my knowledge. When she sees something <br/>\nlike that ornament that she likes, she tells me, and we would usually ask <br/>\nabout it immediately. In the past some kind people at a family owned diner <br/>\ngave her a little carved wooden angel that she was adimiring - it was very <br/>\nsweet and I think they appreciated Jayn effusive gratitude in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I would insist on returning the ornament, because the feelings of <br/>\nthe managment about their tree are irrelevant to the idea that taking <br/>\nsomething that belongs to others without permission is a bad idea in <br/>\ngeneral. But I would also show Jayn that she can always trust me to help her <br/>\nget what she wants by seeking out something similar to buy locally or find a <br/>\nway to make it. We could make a quest of it that would replace a bad memory <br/>\nwith a good experience<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

They woulnn&#39;t put family heirloom ornaments on a tree in a  <br/>\npublic place.  It&#39;s difficult to mail things the week before  <br/>\nChristmas.  They might rather have cash.  They might not even save  <br/>\nthose ornaments from year to year but might say &quot;Oh, keep it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one of my children stole an ornament from a private home, I would  <br/>\ndefinitely send it back and not even consider offering to buy it.   <br/>\nPeople&#39;s ornaments on their own trees in their own homes probably have  <br/>\nsentimental value.

It&#39;s probably better to have some posts introducing myself before jumping in, but I feel strongly about this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the ornament should be returned and as an alternative to that offer to pay for it--not the other way around.  It is difficult, but children can understand concepts such as property.  They can understand how they might feel if someone took one of their things and how it would be better if it was returned to them rather than the person offering to pay them for their thing--as if he/she has the right to decide what to do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not your daughter&#39;s ornament.  She took it.  She should return it.  If the people are amenable, you can pay for it.  But, that&#39;s their decision to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving said all of this, I also don&#39;t think you should shame your daughter, but empathize with her strong feelings about the ornament.  It was special to her.  Captivating.  Amazing.  But, it might be so to the hotel people too.  And, even if it wasn&#39;t special to them, it was theirs.  Just as your daughter has her stuff--is it only protected and hers to have if it&#39;s special and amazing?  Doesn&#39;t that set up the kind of limited thinking we want to avoid?  i.e. &quot;You already have that, you don&#39;t need more!&quot;  Or, &quot;You never play with the one you have--we should get rid of it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your daughter should be helped to understand this.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter took a stuffed animal from a friend once when she was 4 or 5.  I discovered it when we were driving away from the playdate, almost at home,  as she was hiding it from me under her shirt... she was not good at being sneaky, and felt horrible and scared and guilty about it.  I was sympathetic and we talked about how great the lion was.  It&#39;s fur was so soft and fluffy and it looked kind but was also strong and majestic, just like a real lion.  She liked it and wanted it to be her friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI called the mom when we got home and offered to return right away and she suggested that we could come back the next day.  So, I told my daughter that the lion could have a sleepover with us and meet all of her animals, and then she&#39;d have to go back home where she had all of her family and friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter was a little sad about it all, but understood, at least as a concept, that the lion should go back to her friend who was missing it, that it was hers and that we must not take things that don&#39;t belong to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI share my things with my kids to an extent.  There are some things that I don&#39;t--they&#39;re special to me or inappropriate for kids.  I don&#39;t expect my kids to share unless they want to usually.  If something is special to them, they don&#39;t have to share it, but we put it away or don&#39;t bring it with us if we will be around other kids who might want it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids understand that they have right over their own property and by extension that others have right over their own.  They also like to share all sorts of things with us and their friends and are generous.  It comes from them without my prompting. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are imperfect kids just as I am an imperfect mom.  We don&#39;t always get it right and we tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over until we don&#39;t any more.  It is not a straight, even line. But, we&#39;re trying. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra often speaks about being conscious about living with principles more than following rigid rules, and I think the concept of property and ownership is a principle that children can learn about and have evenly applied with them and the rest of the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think your daughter can understand.  She might not like it, she might be sad about it, but she can understand big ideas.  Most kids can.<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura G.<br/>\n(Mom to an 11 year old Runescape fanatic boy and a 9 year old Harry Potter officianado girl. Wife to a ukulele playing industrial designer husband.

I remember stealing a Weeble--<br/>\ndoes anybody remember those toys?--in preschool, because I thought<br/>\nWeebles were SOOOO cool, and I didn&#39;t have any, and I knew my parents<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t afford to buy me any.  I put it in my pocket and brought it home<br/>\nfrom pre-school, then hid it in my room.  Couldn&#39;t sleep a wink that night,<br/>\ntossing and turning with guilt.  You can bet I snuck that Weeble back into<br/>\nmy classroom the next day!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other memory is of something that happened a year or two later:  I got<br/>\nto wondering what pebbles would sound like as they bounced off the sides of a <br/>\nmoving car.  It honestly NEVER occurred to me that throwing rocks at cars<br/>\ncould do damage, or that the owners of the cars might be upset.  I was just<br/>\nhonestly curious about what sort of sound the pebbles would make.  I think<br/>\nI had become aware of the Doppler effect, and was wondering about that...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, one day, after school, at the baby sitter&#39;s house, I mentioned this<br/>\nto the baby sitters&#39; two daughters.  They thought throwing rocks at cars sounded<br/>\nlike fun, so off we went to give it a try.  Can you imagine my surprise when the<br/>\nfirst car we threw pebbles came to a screeching stop, and a VERY angry man<br/>\ngot out and yelled at us?  Honestly, I was SHOCKED.  To me, this was no different<br/>\nthan skipping stones across a pond, but, gosh, this guy was ANGRY.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe hollered at us for awhile, and then He then complained to the babysitter, who <br/>\npromptly spanked her two girls, yelling at them for being a bad example for me.  <br/>\n(They were often in trouble, and I never was.)  The whole story was relayed to my <br/>\nmother when she came to pick me up, with MORE apologies for how the other<br/>\ngirls had been a bad influence on me.  All the way home, my mother talked<br/>\nabout how proud she was that I didn&#39;t act like those other, stupid girls, how relieved<br/>\nshe was that she didn&#39;t have to spank me and send me to bed without my supper.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI recall it took me several days to &#39;fess up to being the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind that <br/>\nparticular adventure; I remember being in tears, crying for fear of being spanked<br/>\nand sent to bed without my supper, crying because I didn&#39;t know how I could<br/>\nhave been so stupid, and crying because I had let my parents down by acting <br/>\nstupid.  What I can&#39;t remember is what happened AFTER my confession.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I was thinking, sometimes people make mistakes because of an<br/>\nimpulse, and sometimes people just aren&#39;t thinking things through.  If we<br/>\ncan help our kids to think things through, I think (hope) that they will become<br/>\nmore able to think more things through on our own... eventually.  But of course,<br/>\nthere are times all through life when we make mistakes, and need a safe person<br/>\nto talk to, and need forgiveness, and help in making amends.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, these memories remind me that we can pass judgment on our kids,<br/>\nindirectly, by passing judgment on others&#39;.  If we aren&#39;t tolerant, forgiving,<br/>\nunderstanding of people in general, then we our kids won&#39;t feel that we<br/>\nwill be tolerant, forgiving, understanding of them, and with good reason!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can respond to our children&#39;s mistakes in a way that encourages them to<br/>\nlet us help them to think the problem though and to make amends.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people appreciate when others make amends.  The missing ornament<br/>\nmay have gone unnoticed, but the act of sending it back, or paying for<br/>\na replacement, most likely will NOT go unnoticed.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Sturman<br/>\n<br/>\nwrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thanks Sandra,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s very true what you say about children getting themselves in situations that they don&#39;t know how to handle. </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180190530,"authorName":"casa_divina","from":"&quot;casa_divina&quot; &lt;casa_divina@...&gt;","profile":"casa_divina","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: My daughter has stolen something....","postDate":"1260906954","msgId":49145,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhnOHBrYStjZXQyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PERDMzJGNTNGLUY2RkYtNEEzOS05MDgzLTIwNzYxMzY3RDQ2NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49144,"nextInTopic":49147,"prevInTime":49144,"nextInTime":49146,"topicId":49139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks Sandra, I like the idea of calling the hotel and offering to pay for it, or return it.

We have been unschooling for a year or so. we live in Ecuador and my children are 6 and 4.5. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I took my two daughters into the &quot;big city&quot; Quito and we ended up doing alot of fun things, buying a few pre-Christmas gifts and seeing friends. We spent the night in a hotel. Everytime we walked by the Christmas tree in the lobby, Divina (6) would admire one of the ornaments on the tree. It was a beautiful beaded, long ornament. She has recently gotten into beading and we stopped many times to admire the color of the beads, the design, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the bus on the way home Divina and her sister, Sabina, were sitting to together and started to act funny - like they were doing something they knew they shouldn&#39;t be doing. I was curious and asked them what was up. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past that has been the time they almost always filled me in on whatever suspicious activity they are up to. I have tried to be really aware of how I respond when they tell me they have broken something, or have done something that I might be upset about. I know they usually tell me what&#39;s going on because they know they won&#39;t &quot;get in trouble&quot; and we always talk about it. If it has been something that upsets me, then I let them know that. And we talk about why. Why they did it, why it upset me. And then it&#39;s over. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo when they both said &quot;nothing&quot; on the bus and the secrets and guilty faces continued I decided to let it go, trusting that they would tell me when it was time. Later on the bus ride I saw the Christmas tree ornament hanging out of Divina&#39;s bag. My face got red and my heart fell when I realized she had stolen the ornament from the hotel and then was hiding it from me on the bus. I was exhausted and the girls were really wound up, so I knew that it wasn&#39;t the time to take on the subject.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLater, as we were arriving to our hometown, Divina told me that she had taken the ornament. I was relieved that she was honest with me, but totally not sure how to respond. I knew shaming her and making her feel bad was not the way to go if I wanted to foster open, honest communication. But, I also felt like she should be aware of the gravity of the situation (ie stealing is NOT GOOD). So I told her that I wished she would have told me that she wanted to have the ornament when we were at the hotel. We could have asked if we could pay for it, or asked them where they got, to get one similar. I told her it was not okay to take things that belong to someone else without asking. Then I shut up. I have a tendency to say too much and I really didn&#39;t want to blow it. <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, at that same hotel, she really liked the fake flowers they had there. We looked for something like it in stores and found nothing. So she asked me if I would ask them if we could buy a few from them. It&#39;s a small, family-run hotel and it seemed reasonable. They know us, as we stay there a few times a year, and so I did ask. The receptionist was really sweet and handed us a few flowers at no charge. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when we got home I noticed that she had hung the ornament on the tree. It made me feel weird to have a stolen ornament on our tree, and I quietly and privately told her so. I also told her that I thought we should mail back the ornament to the hotel. I mentioned it to my husband as well, but really played it down and kinda joked about it, because I was worried he would get on her back about it, or shame her or lecture her. But that didn&#39;t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to wrap this up (ha! Christmas pun intended) I&#39;m wondering how other unschooling families have handled stealing/pocketing with their small children. I feel sort of betrayed. Like she&#39;s growing up and wanting to leave me out of her thoughts and actions (which I guess she has a right to, I mean that&#39;s what maturing is to some extent, right? ) But I&#39;m hoping to learn how I can still be included in those internal dialogues (when considering taking something, or doing something she knows she shouldn&#39;t do).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, that same day, we were at a friend&#39;s house and the friend&#39;s bracelet dropped out of Divina&#39;s bag. She had obviously pocketed it and Sabina (her sister) promptly picked it up and gave it back to the friend. I decided not to say anything in the moment because the situation had sort of taken care of itself. Again, not sure if I handled that right. Maybe I should have a follow up conversation, but also worried about to much blah blah.<br/>\n<br/>\nthoughts and experience greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nMolly in Ecuador<br/>\nDivina 6<br/>\nSabina 4.5</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":328693792,"authorName":"Christy","from":"&quot;Christy&quot; &lt;christy@...&gt;","profile":"christy_blueridge","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"New Member with lots of questions...","postDate":"1260748831","msgId":49139,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhnM3Y2dithdjE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49141,"prevInTime":49138,"nextInTime":49140,"topicId":49139,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wanted to take the time to introduce myself.

I&#39;ve been on this list now for a few weeks, and thoroughly enjoying the discussions here, and thought it was time to say Hi!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy name is Christy--I am married (5 years) and have two children--1 biological son (17) and 1 adopted daughter (3).  We are in our 4th year of homeschooling, and our 1st embracing the unschooling philosophy.  We are doing well--our son is the most at peace and free than he has ever been and it is wonderful to watch all that he is embracing as his passions emerge. Our daughter is a free spirit and has been able to discover her passions as well--which is also an incredible sight :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are currently foster parents in our state and have begun to provide care for 2 young girls (ages 3 and 5).  We are hoping to adopt them, but as of right now, their case is still tied up in the court system and could be for quite some time.  The obstacle I am facing at this time is how to parent them....since our priorities seem to be a bit different than those of the Department of Social Services.  Anything from eating to sleeping to discipline to school...very different views.  I find myself slipping into my authoritarian past and demanding respect---mainly because I feel the pressure to &quot;be&quot; something different than what we are.  Plus the girls are coming from a very authoritarian home, so the react negatively to any correction.  They also demand things as well--what to eat, to play, to watch on tv...they have been described as children with &quot;attachment issues&quot; and have been treated as such... <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is difficult, these are children that I did not birth and they have come to us with their own set of issues that we were not a part of...yet their frustration is directed toward us and anyone that disagrees with them.  We are continuing to look at them as the beautiful children that they are, accentuate the positive and try to overlook the rest...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just curious if anyone on this list has had similar experiences and if so, can you offer your thoughts on how to encourage the children and remain true to your convictions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for reading ;)<br/>\nChristy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49181,"nextTopicId":49188}}
