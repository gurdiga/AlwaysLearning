The same year, the magazine hired Daniel Ford&#39;s <br/>\nradical young friend, Baptist minister, Nationalist, and Christian Socialist <br/>\nleader, Francis Bellamy, to help Upham in his public relations work. Bellamy <br/>\nwas the first cousin of the famous American socialist, Edward Bellamy. Edward <br/>\nBellamy&#39;s futuristic novel, &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, published in 1888, described <br/>\na utopian Boston in the year 2000. The book spawned an elitist socialist <br/>\nmovement in Boston known as &quot;Nationalism,&quot; whose members wanted the federal <br/>\ngovernment to national most of the American economy. Francis Bellamy was a <br/>\nmember of this movement and a vice president of its auxiliary group, the <br/>\nSociety of Christian Socialists 2. He was a baptist minister and he lectured <br/>\nand preached on the virtues of socialism and the evils of capitalism. He gave <br/>\na speech on &quot;Jesus the Socialist&quot; and a series of sermons on &quot;The Socialism <br/>\nof the Primitive Church.&quot; In 1891, he was forced to resign from his Boston <br/>\nchurch, the Bethany Baptist church, because of his socialist activities. He <br/>\nthen joined the staff of the Youths&#39; Companion3.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy February 1892, Francis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the National <br/>\nEducation Association to support the Youths&#39; Companion as a sponsor of the <br/>\nnational public schools&#39; observance of Columbus Day along with the use of the <br/>\nAmerican flag. By June 29, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and <br/>\nPresident Benjamin Harrison to announce a national proclamation making the <br/>\npublic school flag ceremony the center of the national Columbus Day <br/>\ncelebrations for 18924.<br/>\n<br/>\nBellamy, under the supervision of Upham, wrote the program for this <br/>\ncelebration, including its flag salute, the Pledge of Allegiance. His version <br/>\nwas, <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the Republic for which it stands -- <br/>\none nation indivisible -- with liberty and justice for all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis program and its pledge appeared in the September 8 issue of Youths&#39; <br/>\nCompanion5. He considered putting the words &quot;fraternity&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; in <br/>\nthe Pledge but decided they were too radical and controversial for public <br/>\nschools6.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original Pledge was recited while giving a stiff, uplifted right hand <br/>\nsalute, criticized and discontinued during WWII. The words &quot;my flag&quot; were <br/>\nchanged to &quot;the flag of the United States of America&quot; because it was feared <br/>\nthat the children of immigrants might confuse &quot;my flag&quot; for the flag of their <br/>\nhomeland. The phrase, &quot;Under God,&quot; was added by Congress and President <br/>\nEisenhower in 1954 at the urging of the Knights of Columbus7.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe American Legion&#39;s constitution includes the following goal: &quot;To foster <br/>\nand perpetuate a one hundred percent Americanism.&quot; One of its major standing <br/>\ncommittees was the &quot;Americanism Commission&quot; and its subsidiary, the &quot;Counter <br/>\nSubversive Activities Committee.&quot; To the fear of immigrants, it added the <br/>\nfear of communism8.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the years the Legion has worked closely with the NEA and with the U.S. <br/>\nOffice of Education. The Legion insisted on &quot;one hundred percent&quot; Americanism <br/>\nin public school courses in American history, civics, geography and English. <br/>\nThe Pledge was a part of this Americanism campaign9 and, in 1950, the Legion <br/>\nadopted the Pledge as an official part of its own ritual10.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 1922, the Ku Klux Klan, which also had adopted the &quot;one hundred percent <br/>\nAmericanism&quot; theme along with the flag ceremonies and the Pledge, became a <br/>\npolitical power in the state of Oregon and arranged for legislation to be <br/>\npasses requiring all Catholic children to attend public schools. The U.S. <br/>\nSupreme Court later overturned this legislation11.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps a team of social scientists and historians could explain why over the <br/>\nlast century the Pledge of Allegiance has become a major centerpiece in <br/>\nAmerican patriotism programs. A pledge or loyalty oath for children was not <br/>\nbuilt around the Declaration of Independence -- &quot;We hold these truths to be <br/>\nself-evident, that all men are created equal...&quot; Or the Gettysburg address -- <br/>\n&quot;a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all <br/>\nmen are created equal...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently, over the last century, Americans have been uncomfortable with the <br/>\nword &quot;equality&quot; as a patriotic theme. In 1992 the nation will begin its <br/>\nsecond century with the Pledge of Allegiance. Perhaps the time has come to <br/>\nsee that this allegiance should be to the U.S. constitution and not to a <br/>\npiece of cloth.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":9199,"nextTopicId":9237}}
