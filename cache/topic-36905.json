What do they want to do?  Is your husband still<br/>\non board with unschooling?  Is he feeling influence from his family, or<br/>\nis his discomfort coming from not really understanding unschooling?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to limit interaction with inlaws?  How important is it<br/>\nfor your kids to have a relationship with their grandparents?  Does your<br/>\nhusband know what he wants for your kids?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking that you need to talk about educational goals with your<br/>\nhusband to see if you are on the same page.  Some dads have really<br/>\nstrong feelings about it and some are more complacent about it.  Mine<br/>\nwas more complacent about it and gradually came to accept unschooling,<br/>\nand now fully advocates it.  It took a while, but we also didn&#39;t have<br/>\nextended family making things hard.  We are lucky in that both of our<br/>\nextended family members butt out, wether they agree or not with what we<br/>\ndo, they love us and accept our decisions and find good things about<br/>\nwhat we are doing and try to ignore the things they don&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sad for others who have interfering in-laws that place judgement<br/>\non them and use it to manipulate the relationship with the kids.  It&#39;s<br/>\nicky.  If it were me in that situation, I would find a way to get that<br/>\nicky out of my happy life.
