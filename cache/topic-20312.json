He is one <br/>\nof those kids who never seems to slowly learn something, it&#39;s like <br/>\nhe can&#39;t do it, he can&#39;t do it, he can&#39;t do it no matter how hard <br/>\nanyone tries to &quot;teach&quot; him, then all of a sudden, usually when no <br/>\none expects it - He&#39;s doing it! <br/>\n    So I think that perhaps this one one of those learning <br/>\nexperiences that he just didn&#39;t realize how much the yelling and <br/>\nhitting was actually hurting me and he seems to really get it now! <br/>\nToday we went into a convenience store for a soda (my only bad <br/>\nhabbit, I know it&#39;s corn syrup but I like my soda!) and as we were <br/>\nheaded out the door he said something like &quot;you&#39;re just stupid mom!&quot; <br/>\nand I told him that what he said hurt me, he said then he was <br/>\njust &quot;teasing with me&quot; so I told him if he wants to just &quot;tease&quot; <br/>\nwith me to call me &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or something more like that <br/>\nbecause those are words you can &quot;tease&quot; with and and not hurt <br/>\nsomeone. Then I asked him why he called me stupid (normally I would <br/>\nhave probably asked him why he did it first, but I&#39;ve been so hurt <br/>\nby his name calling lately I just blurted it out) and he said he was <br/>\njust teasing so I said, &quot;well you&#39;re silly!&quot; and gave him a big kiss <br/>\nto let him know I was teasing him. We&#39;ll probably go over the actual <br/>\nmeaning of stupid at some point so he can use it in a more correct <br/>\nmanner, but for now I&#39;m happy that that was our only &quot;clash&quot; of the <br/>\nday and we both came out of it feeling good. Since my son isn&#39;t <br/>\nyelled at or hit, or pulled around, etc.  by me or other family <br/>\nmembers when he does something &quot;incorrect&quot;, and now he understands <br/>\nfor himself why it&#39;s important not to treat people this way, I think <br/>\nthings between us are going to be a lot better, I swear a light bulb <br/>\nwent off in his head!<br/>\n     I think lots of kids who are punished when they do something <br/>\nwrong, probably don&#39;t actually know the correct way, but they know <br/>\nwhat to do to not be punished. So yeah, some people might think the <br/>\nway my 6yo acts may not be &quot;acting as well as he should for his age&quot; <br/>\nbut I need to put my trust in that he is acting as well as he <br/>\nunderstands and he is learning more (not being coersed, or told to, <br/>\nbut actually learning) all the time. <br/>\n    I am babbling now but I have had such a circle of thinking this <br/>\nmonth that a few days ago I was ready to give up the unschooling / <br/>\ntaking children seriously/ natural learning (whatever you wanna call <br/>\nit!) approach because things were just getting so bad and now I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t think of doing anything differently!

I&#39;m<br/>\nhappy that things are going better now.  Be prepared<br/>\nif they seem to revert back for a while.  My daughter,<br/>\nLanora 13, has been one of my best reminders that<br/>\nthings are truly improving, even when J takes a spiral<br/>\ndown for a bit.  He has long periods where I am<br/>\nconvinced it&#39;s all over and can hardly remember what<br/>\nit was like, then he will have a bad period.  Lanora<br/>\nreminds me to not over-react.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing I can do for myself and for J is to<br/>\nkeep myself centered, think ahead about how to react<br/>\nand hold the image of who I know he really is in my<br/>\nmind.  It has also helped my stress level a LOT by<br/>\ntalking with other moms and learning that I&#39;m not<br/>\nalone, there are so many of us who are dealing with<br/>\nchildren who have temperaments like ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and one more thing, something that has helped the<br/>\nmost with J has been humor.  We began a game, when he<br/>\ncalls me &#39;stupid&#39; or says &#39;shut up&#39; I tickle him.  He<br/>\nmade up the second half of the game which is that he<br/>\nhas to say, &#39;I love you, mommy&#39; to make me stop.  It<br/>\ndiffused the power of the words and gave him an out<br/>\nfor a moment that may have escalated emotionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nLanora and I, both, will withdraw our willingness to<br/>\nplay if he becomes too rude or aggressive.  He LIVES<br/>\nto have us play with him so this has been a good<br/>\nmotivator to be more pleasant and self-controlled.  I<br/>\nbelieve it&#39;s a natural consequence of unsocial<br/>\nbehavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend with a 23 year old son who tells me<br/>\nthat he was just like Jonathan.  Ben is very nice,<br/>\nopen, pleasant and personable now, it was such a good<br/>\nthing for me to hear.  She says that she used to have<br/>\nto sit on him to keep him from harming himself or<br/>\nothers when he was J&#39;s age, one would never know that<br/>\nabout him now.  However, she says he still has to put<br/>\nreal effort into empathy, to understand how others<br/>\nthink and feel.  He genuinely likes people but empathy<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t come naturally, perhaps it&#39;s the hallmark of<br/>\nthis kind of child.  Just because it&#39;s not natural<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t important to them or that they<br/>\ncan&#39;t learn how to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nKris<br/>\n<br/>\n--- mozafamily &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mozafamily@...\">mozafamily@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think a turning point was when he was running<br/>\n&gt; through the post <br/>\n&gt; office screaming at me that he hated me and that he<br/>\n&gt; didn&#39;t want me <br/>\n&gt; for a mom anymore all this with no known cause so<br/>\n&gt; then I told him <br/>\n&gt; that I couldn&#39;t take him to the library to look for<br/>\n&gt; a video he <br/>\n&gt; wanted because I felt I couldn&#39;t trust him not to<br/>\n&gt; act that same way <br/>\n&gt; in the library, then he had a huge tantrum over not<br/>\n&gt; getting his way <br/>\n&gt; about that and was screaming at me until he noticed<br/>\n&gt; that I was <br/>\n&gt; crying also and had tears dripping down my cheeks<br/>\n&gt; and he <br/>\n&gt; asked &quot;what&#39;s wrong mom?&quot; And I told him that when<br/>\n&gt; he yelled at me <br/>\n&gt; like that it was like he was hitting me hard, that<br/>\n&gt; it hurt when he <br/>\n&gt; said those things.
