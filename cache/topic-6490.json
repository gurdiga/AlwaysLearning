I just can&#39;t stomach his films now. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you read much about and of Mia Farrow?  That wasn&#39;t a very healthy <br/>\nrelationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people get kind of crazed about adopting children, and more and more of <br/>\nthem.  We know someone personally with an odd urge to adopt.  (Oh!  Two <br/>\nfamilies, now that I think of it.)  To the obvious and direct detriment of <br/>\ntheir already-there children, they add more.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that was the story of two famous people and their personal unravellings <br/>\nand situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe movies are not based on that, nor about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a friend who loved Harrison Ford and loved all the movies.  I like <br/>\nmost of those movies.  I&#39;ve enjoyed watching Harrison Ford act since American <br/>\nGraffiti.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he left his wife.  That&#39;s none of my business.  It&#39;s sad, but they&#39;ll <br/>\nrecover.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my friend refuses to go and see another movie of his or read an article <br/>\nbecause he left his wife.  She doesn&#39;t know either of them, and never will.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand some of Elvis&#39;s fans didn&#39;t react well when he got married.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is a little bit TOO much vicarious living and fantasy life.  Either like <br/>\nhis music or not. Have a crush on his 20 year old form or not.  But get a <br/>\ngrip on where you are and what is what!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo unless Dan and Matthew have a crush on the robotics teacher (WHICH I <br/>\nSERIOUSLY DOUBT) and unless they plan to make an icon of him which they will <br/>\nturn to in times of trouble and doubt, wanting to grow up to be just like him <br/>\nin every way, I don&#39;t see a problem with them continuing to learn robotics <br/>\nfrom him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the robotics-club market were broad and varied, yeah--make it one of <br/>\nseveral factors, along with how comfortable are the chairs?  What time is the <br/>\nmeeting?  How&#39;s the parking?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen people leave a church because they didn&#39;t like the way the pastor&#39;s <br/>\nwife treated her kids.  Never mind Jesus, they want to control and approve <br/>\nall aspects of the lives of those they feel are controlling and approving them<br/>\n.  At least in a church it&#39;s two ways.  I&#39;m pretty sure Harrison Ford didn&#39;t <br/>\ngive my friend a single thought when he and his wife were disagreeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6473,"nextTopicId":6493}}
