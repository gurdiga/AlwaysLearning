This is a recent development.<br/>\nBefore me and Brian broke up for 1 1/2 years all but one were very vocal<br/>\nabout the punitive measures they used with the nine children between them,<br/>\nall told.  When I lived with one of those sisters-in-law, there was a lot of<br/>\ncomment about how lax my parenting was/is, and I rarely said much (in order<br/>\nto avoid adding to the noise) unless it was to help Karl get what he<br/>\nwanted/needed, at least some of the time... like ensuring that he wasn&#39;t<br/>\nforced to eat things he didn&#39;t want.  That sister-in-law is phasing out<br/>\nspanking with all of her 5 boys, which was a nightly ritual as late as last<br/>\nyear.  I guess the proof&#39;s in the pudding, so to speak.  We have never<br/>\nspanked Karl and the drudgery of nightly spankings perhaps has struck them<br/>\nas completely unnecessary.  I haven&#39;t heard any conversations about changes<br/>\nin their parenting.  Mum&#39;s the word.  I don&#39;t mind.  Their secret&#39;s safe<br/>\nwith me.
