What we believe and  <br/>\nwhat we<br/>\nsometimes do sometimes are not compatable.  Do we still  believe?  Of <br/>\ncourse!<br/>\nAre we still human, and striving to live our  ideals, I think so.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-=-=-=-==-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\naaaahhhh----I don&#39;t buy this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe in spanking. I have done it too. But as soon as I knew <br/>\nbetter, I DID better. And never did it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really think the spanking thing is EASY to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be my first reaction to things (ingrained since childhood), but <br/>\nit takes more than one step/one thought/one motion to GET there, so I <br/>\ncan stop myself from actually DOing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo spank, you have to have a hold of the child, raise your hand, and <br/>\nswat---and that&#39;s if everything is *right* there. So somewhere in <br/>\nbetween, I can get a grip on myself and s-t-o-p. It&#39;s gotten so easy <br/>\nover the years, I don&#39;t even have to think about it anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nYellling&#39;s a different story. Opening my mouth is the only step needed! <br/>\n&lt;g&gt; So now I remember to breeeeeathe before I utter a word. Finding <br/>\nthat tool is still difficult because it&#39;s an *extra* step. With <br/>\nspanking, I had three or more steps to go through to stop hitting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for unschooling. Believing in it and understanding it are pretty <br/>\ndeep ideas/thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think someone can believe that it&#39;s possible to do---that there is a <br/>\npositive outcome. Someone can understand that natural learning makes <br/>\nsense. And I think you can &#39;fake it &#39;til you make it&#39; by going through <br/>\nthe motions and stopping curricula and grading and testing and <br/>\ncomparisons and other school-think & -do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is nowhere NEAR *getting* it and believing in it and <br/>\nunderstanding it. I don&#39;t think you can get to *that* point until <br/>\nwell.... you&#39;re *past* that point and know down deep in your soul that <br/>\nlearning is natural. That coerced learning damages natural learning. <br/>\nThat each child is an individual who shouldn&#39;t and can&#39;t be measured.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have to really believe it right down to your toes or you&#39;re <br/>\njust spouting off about something that you think might work. Maybe. <br/>\nUnder the right circumstances. With the right kid.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly, who believes it down deep in her soul and all the way to the <br/>\ntips of her toes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\nOctober 6-9, 2005<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://liveandlearnconference.org\">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: 2 Questions","postDate":"1113571436","msgId":22035,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyOC41YWRkYWQ2OS4yZjkxMWE2Y0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":22036,"prevInTime":22034,"nextInTime":22036,"topicId":22035,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Years ago a woman in my very first homeschooling group stated, I don t believe in spanking, but that doesn t mean I haven t spanked.
