If she liked it, I would tend to go along with her evaluation.  If she didn&#39;t, I would still find something *honestly* positive to say about either the cake or how she created it or something.  If she asked a specific question I would answer that honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does your daughter like about the idea of a contest?  Where did she get the idea to create a new recipe?    <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would be reasonable to explain that it is common for cooks to make a recipe a few times changing the ingredients a little to see what the result is.  Maybe she would enjoy this process with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to just let Virginia make her own cakes thinking she could learn from the process on her own.  Unfortunately she was too young to do this and what she learned was the process was too difficult and she couldn&#39;t do it well.  Realizing she had trouble following the step-by-step directions, this year we set up little cooking lessons.  I put a few steps on a small chalk board and she completed them and checked them off.  Then I would add more and so on.  She had some wonderful successes and became very interested in cooking for a while.  Now she thinks of herself as quite a good cook which is what I would like her to think.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPat <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My daughter&#39;s baking experiments","postDate":"1013403519","msgId":4613,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwMjExMDQ1ODM5Ljc2ODU0LnFtYWlsQHdlYjE0MzAzLm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGE0N2lkays2cTcwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":4611,"nextInTopic":4632,"prevInTime":4612,"nextInTime":4614,"topicId":4611,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"She already baked it?
