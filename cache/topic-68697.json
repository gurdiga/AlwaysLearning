But nor were they farmers coerced into playing a stone-age tribe. Instead, they were very poor people living close to Nature in the Philippine jungle who became swept up in and manipulated by global events beyond their control. This version of events isn&#39;t as compelling as the versions that made headlines in 1971 and 1986, but it is a good illustration of how the truth is often far messier and more complicated than it appears at first glance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want first source stuff you can read Lawrence Reid&#39;s papers on the Tasaday (as well as on other linguistic groups in the Philippines) at his webpage here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.hawaii.edu/~reid/publications.html.\">http://www2.hawaii.edu/~reid/publications.html.</a> He has a paper that precedes the Tasaday reviews on how hunter-gatherer groups don&#39;t live in isolation: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www2.hawaii.edu/~reid/Combined%20Files/A30.1991.%20Headland-Reid--Holocene%20foragers.pdf.\">http://www2.hawaii.edu/~reid/Combined%20Files/A30.1991.%20Headland-Reid--Holocene%20foragers.pdf.</a> It is interesting to see linguistics used as a dating method, like carbon dating. How language differences build up in a predictable way that you can date a population split.
