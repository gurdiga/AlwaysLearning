I remember hopping out of the car when I was 9 to step in between him and another man with a pistol.  The two men were yelling at each other over a traffic situation (this was the late 70s in NYC.  Apparently lots of people had guns.)  I stepped between them because I thought that neither one would shoot if they saw a little girl between them.  Fortunately I was right.  My point is that when my son used to play guns of all sorts his play had absolutely *nothing* to do with the fear and terror of those real gun situations.  He grew up safe and sound with no real violence in his experience.  The pretend gun play was something entirely different for him.  It was joyful and fun and the minute I recognized this, my impulse to keep the pretend guns away from him evaporated.  He has played with just about every form of toy gun and sword and virtual weapon there is.  He has never been interested in shooting a real gun and is personally at age 16 a pacifist in real life though he enjoys playing first person shooter - video games.  If I hadn&#39;t understood this early on we would have had years of conflict over it since he was so strongly in love with that sort of play.  Now that I can see how very very peaceful he grew up to be I am really glad I didn&#39;t spend those years fighting, arguing, or shaming him over it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Krisula Moyer<br/>\nThe Seer, the novel <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":383312070,"authorName":"Cara Barlow","from":"Cara Barlow &lt;carabarlow@...&gt;","profile":"crbrlw","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Toy Weapons","postDate":"1272485543","msgId":53560,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG8ybzdhMDlmNDFmMTAwNDI4MTMxMnQ0OTI2Yzc2OHFjM2UxNjg3ZWNkM2M3NDFiQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PHEyemM5Y2ExYmJhMTAwNDI4MTI1M2tmOWJlMGM3N2gzNDIzNDM1NTgxYTFjMjc3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhyODZnaytlNTM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aHI5aWVuK2s3OGlAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CSA8bTJ2NDhjN2UyMDYxMDA0MjgwODUzaGNmMjI1NTAzZ2E5ZmQ5MWNmZjljZjcwYjNAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8NTA1QTMwNTktREQyQi00Qjk2LUE4QkYtQ0I0NDQ4NDA1RUM5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgkgPHEyemM5Y2ExYmJhMTAwNDI4MTI1M2tmOWJlMGM3N2gzNDIzNDM1NTgxYTFjMjc3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53558,"nextInTopic":53562,"prevInTime":53559,"nextInTime":53561,"topicId":53519,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
