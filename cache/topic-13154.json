I looked back at him when we were getting in <br/>\nline for the lift.  He had fallen over and was sliding into a fence.  Some <br/>\nyoung kids were coming up in line and laughing at him.  It made me mad.  When <br/>\nTrevor came up, he said &quot;that was mean&quot; - it turns out the kids had tripped <br/>\nhim (whether accidentally, or on purpose, I don&#39;t know), and that&#39;s why he <br/>\nfell - I replied I wished I&#39;d have whacked them with my pole!!!  He just <br/>\nsmiled and went on with the day with total enjoyment.  Such a lesson for me <br/>\nnot to work on the revenge and negative stuff - just let it go, and be <br/>\nhappy!!! We were on the beautiful mountain, having a wonderful time, he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t let them ruin it for him at all!  Lesson for mom!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I was in No. Dakota with Shawn (age 28) at his national diving <br/>\ntournament a couple weeks ago.  (He won the 1 and 3 meter title for the <br/>\nsecond year running).  He was so focussed, and concentrated, not taking his <br/>\nskills for granted, and not caring about any of it, but doing his very best.  <br/>\nHe didn&#39;t start college til he was 23, or diving til he was over 20.  There <br/>\nhe is excelling at both.  I am so proud of him - especially knowing he had a <br/>\nsevere problem with depression when he was about 25, and on Monday will be in <br/>\nWash. DC at a press conference thing with about 8 others who have made media <br/>\nmessages about male depression that will be airing soon.  (He did a public <br/>\nrelations spot in TX for the clinic that helped him there, and that lead to <br/>\nthe national one.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we need to be so respectful and kind to our children when they are <br/>\nlittle and we have so much control over their lives, because it makes such an <br/>\nimpact over how we and they view the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI DO have grown up children, and they are such a blessing to me, and have <br/>\ntaught, and continue to teach me so many lessons about life.  I keep hearing <br/>\nmy words from their mouths, and am please when they are kind ones :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough for now --<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13103,"nextTopicId":13171}}
