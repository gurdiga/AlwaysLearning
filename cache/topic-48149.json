When I dig in our closets I always  <br/>\nfind things I&#39;d forgotten about. Those are often great inspiration for  <br/>\nnew activity. Art supplies, dress-up clothes, kits. Or build a big  <br/>\nfort under the kitchen table. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nCloth over furniture can be miraculous. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t forget other senses, when kids are restless.  Homemade playdough  <br/>\neven without added scents has smell and touch.  Cooking something will  <br/>\nput scent into the air, and maybe taste into their morning.   Music!   <br/>\nMusic, music, music, as background or focus.   Musicals on the TV, as  <br/>\nbackground.  They can let it pass by until their favorite parts come  <br/>\non.   Sing along to it even if they&#39;re not listening.<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmed up blankets.  My sister called yesterday and she has swine  <br/>\nflu.  She said she asked herself what our mom would&#39;ve done, and she  <br/>\nwent and got a cool washcloth to put on her head, and she felt  <br/>\nbetter.  I love to have a load of fresh warm laundry from the dryer  <br/>\ndumped all over me.   Who wouldn&#39;t!?     Towels are the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor girls, especially, pulling out an old jewelry box or a box of  <br/>\nletters from before they were born can be interested for a while.   <br/>\nEven if they can&#39;t read, the stamp and envelopes might be of  <br/>\ninterest.  Postmarks.   Old timey handwriting.   Real hand-written  <br/>\nmail. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOld post cards or Christmas cards, if you save them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooks with art, paintings, photos.<br/>\n<br/>\nEscher books (or websites).<br/>\n<br/>\nMazes or crosswords or connect-the-dots.  You can probably find some  <br/>\nprintable ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying with lit candles.  The two best things I know are squeezing  <br/>\nthe peels of citrus fruit toward candle flame (fresh orange is  <br/>\ngreat).  Hold it with the outside toward the flame, and squeeze so  <br/>\nsome of the oil is squirted into the fire.  It&#39;s pretty and smells  <br/>\ngood.     Or put baby powder or corn starch or flour down in a plate  <br/>\nor tray or box, like half an inch deep, and drip candle wax one drip  <br/>\nat a time.  It makes pretty little beads, kind of.  You can string  <br/>\nthem with thread and needle if you want, or put them in with the  <br/>\nkindling for fire starting, or use them for game pieces or make tiny  <br/>\nBarbie-sized game pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nWax onto water can be interesting too.  See if it&#39;s different into hot  <br/>\nwater or cold.  I&#39;ve never dropped wax into milk or soda or juice.   <br/>\nSeems wasteful, but might be interesting if there was some leftover  <br/>\nanyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nTexture drawing, just crayons or pencils, and putting rough surfaces  <br/>\nunder paper to make rubbings, or writing with pencils on aluminum foil  <br/>\nor waxed paper.  Drop candle drippings onto aluminum foil or waxed  <br/>\npaper or crayon. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nColor with colored crayons and cover up a sheet of paper.   Then color  <br/>\nover the whole thing with black.  Then use a toothpick or a skewer to  <br/>\ndraw, and it will scratch the black off and show the colors  <br/>\nunderneath.  They make commercial versions of this, but you can make  <br/>\nyour own.  (Or if you&#39;re at a crafts store or art shop, see if they  <br/>\nhave the cleaner storebought stuff.  Formally it&#39;s called  <br/>\nscratchboard, but for kids stuff with colors and clear plastic and  <br/>\nwhatever all, it&#39;s more usually called &quot;scratch art.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMore ideas will be here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/art\">http://sandradodd.com/art</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/music\">http://sandradodd.com/music</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] ideas, ideas, ideas","postDate":"1256744952","msgId":48155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIxODJEMTRGLUM0MUUtNDUyMC1BOEVDLTVFNUEwNEMyQkIxQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRBRTg2NUUzLjcwMzAxMDlAbWFjLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhjOWQ2NytsNGprQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NEFFODY1RTMuNzAzMDEwOUBtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48154,"nextInTopic":48156,"prevInTime":48154,"nextInTime":48156,"topicId":48149,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I think we played every game in the house. any ideas would be appreciated.-=- Thrift stores for more games.

We did that years ago when the kids were younger and we were home more often.  We found the key is to make the list when everyone is in good spirits because we excitedly came up with LOTS of ideas.  If we tried to create the list when we were feeling slumpish, then we sat there shrugging our shoulders.  We pasted the list on our pantry door.

So, when people <br/>\nhave less money to spend, they often have MORE fun and more joy.  It <br/>\ndepends on where you turn your attention - to what you can&#39;t do or to <br/>\nwhat you can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKids often play pretend for hours and hours and hours - they don&#39;t <br/>\nalways need structured &quot;things to do&quot; -- but if your kids aren&#39;t <br/>\ncurrently into that, maybe your focus can be on providing them with the <br/>\nbackground material that will spark their imaginations. More movies, tv, <br/>\nand books might be that - or more getting outdoors to go places, if the <br/>\nweather is still good enough where you are to do a lot of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing is for the parents to have enthusiasm for <br/>\nlife&#39;s little enjoyments. Fixing lunch? Say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s take our <br/>\nlunches down to that little park.....&quot; Or going shopping?
