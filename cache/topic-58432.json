I let her borrow The Unschooling Unmanual, directed her to Sandra&#39;s website, and she started unschooling the second she put the book down. (She and I love Sandra&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling because it is like her website put into a book so I am glad you are buying that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one chapter in The Unschooling Unmanual that alone is worth the price of the book.

I can<br/>\nrelate to Shira&#39;s description of feeling like she&#39;s in some no man&#39;s land<br/>\nuntil her children are school age. When Karl turned 6, I waded through by<br/>\nstaying in no man&#39;s land a little longer. Or wait and see land. It was a<br/>\ngood place to be, and to stay. What I saw is that Karl continued to change<br/>\nand to figure out more and more things. Unschooling proving itself to me<br/>\nagain, just as it had when Karl was much younger in those early toddler<br/>\nlightening fast developments flying by but slowing down a bit, and moving<br/>\nfurther on to other types of development than I was used to looking for.<br/>\nLike being good with people of all ages and playing well with many of them.<br/>\nSomething that deepened: understanding and gelling with people, going by<br/>\ntheir emotional responses to things he and others say and do. Something I&#39;ve<br/>\ngotten unused to in myself which I have been inspired to pay more attention<br/>\nto.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be uncomfortable, and therefore motivated to learn more by dent of<br/>\nnot being in a groove of knowing what happens next.

It&#39;s a good way to see that slipping into teacher or<br/>\nknowledge-provider mode need not happen, even if that makes one feel, as one<br/>\nblog comment accused unschoolers of recently, a bit clueless. What is<br/>\nprobably being missed there is that being clueless is not a symptom of<br/>\nhaving no information; it&#39;s a symptom of still being in the process or<br/>\n(hopefully) open to the process of finding the meaning in the info-- which<br/>\nis what learning really is.

Its not uncommon for kids to be curious about school<br/>\n&gt; around age 5 or 6, too - there&#39;s a looooot of &quot;school is fun&quot; propaganda<br/>\n&gt; aimed at helping kids make that transition, after all, so its normal for<br/>\n&gt; unschooling kids to want to know what the fun is all about. And there tends<br/>\n&gt; to be increased pressure on parents from spouses and extended family to<br/>\n&gt; &quot;start doing school&quot; if you&#39;re keeping the kids home. So mandatory school<br/>\n&gt; age is a challenging hurdle to overcome in that regard - and plenty of<br/>\n&gt; families do put kids in school after &quot;unschooling preschool&quot;. That&#39;s one of<br/>\n&gt; the reasons seasoned unschoolers will sometimes say that unschooling doesn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; really start until school age.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d say &quot;getting in a groove&quot; has more to do with adapting to developmental<br/>\n&gt; changes. Kids do change ;) and sometimes those changes can throw parents for<br/>\n&gt; a loop... just when you get things running smoothly, someone&#39;s needs change!<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s something that will slow down a bit, though, as kids get older,<br/>\n&gt; rather than the seemingly endless variations you can get with toddlers.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ------------------------------------<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

If you have a &quot;groove&quot; going by that point, you&#39;ll keep on grooving, I suspect ;) Why wouldn&#39;t you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswering my own question, its not uncommon for parents who &quot;unschool&quot; the preschool years to have a surge of panic when their first child hits mandatory school age. Its not uncommon for kids to be curious about school around age 5 or 6, too - there&#39;s a looooot of &quot;school is fun&quot; propaganda aimed at helping kids make that transition, after all, so its normal for unschooling kids to want to know what the fun is all about. And there tends to be increased pressure on parents from spouses and extended family to &quot;start doing school&quot; if you&#39;re keeping the kids home. So mandatory school age is a challenging hurdle to overcome in that regard - and plenty of families do put kids in school after &quot;unschooling preschool&quot;. That&#39;s one of the reasons seasoned unschoolers will sometimes say that unschooling doesn&#39;t really start until school age. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d say &quot;getting in a groove&quot; has more to do with adapting to developmental changes. Kids do change ;) and sometimes those changes can throw parents for a loop... just when you get things running smoothly, someone&#39;s needs change! That&#39;s something that will slow down a bit, though, as kids get older, rather than the seemingly endless variations you can get with toddlers. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith (Mo 9, Ray 17)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:  Unschooling Book Recommendation","postDate":"1292173370","msgId":58443,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk5NjVENDk0LUZEM0EtNEVFMC1CMDkzLUQ2QzY4RTkzOEVFOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDMyM0ExMjU5NDMyOTRBQkJCRTYzMzg5MkE0RkMzRUYzQGVuZHJlc3RzMDd3Z29qPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEyOTIxNTQ0NTEuMzIyLjYwNDUzLm02QHlhaG9vZ3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDMyM0ExMjU5NDMyOTRBQkJCRTYzMzg5MkE0RkMzRUYzQGVuZHJlc3RzMDd3Z29qPg=="},"prevInTopic":58442,"nextInTopic":58445,"prevInTime":58442,"nextInTime":58444,"topicId":58432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I just bought and read Peggy Pirro s book, 101 Reasons Why I m an Unschooler and highly recommend it!

Or you mean the same old controversy?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>No new controversy that I know of... but I remember the disucssions about other types of unschoolers sounding like they were &#39;selling&#39; unschooling, but really it was some other flavor of unschooling (religious or otherwise).  I&#39;m still not sure how our unschooling is going to completely manifest, since my husband is and Orthodox Jew, and I&#39;m somewhat traditional.  I hope that one doesn&#39;t have to overshadow the other, that both unschooling and Judaism can be balanced out and work together.  But I feel great right now, because I think that however it turns out will be at least 95% better than how we would have parented our kids without knowing about unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, I figured out last time that I almost ordered that I wanted the Big Book, but I don&#39;t remember why so much.  I&#39;ll send in an order ASAP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re visiting my Mother-in-Law in Connecticut.  I hadn&#39;t thought of looking for some unschoolers there to visit.  What a great idea!

The parenting part is more important right now, I think, for my husband, since that is where he struggles, and the learning part is mostly my job right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m curious, those who start unschooling before school-age... when you hit school-age, how long did it take to get into the groove?  Up til now, its mostly coloring, bake cookies, go out to fun places, playdates, city programs, etc.  At 4.5years old, Junior Kindergarten age, I&#39;m not really considering this a real school-age year, since JK didn&#39;t exist when I was that age.  I&#39;ve sort of allotted in my mind the next two years for finding our way, learning to live that swirly life.  Does that  sound realistic?  I feel like the last two years have been about learning the parenting side of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that has been difficult, internalizing that there are no unschooling police (even the ones in my head) and that it takes time to get it all going smoothly, and that there may be some areas of life where circumstances make it difficult to find an unschoolish solution.  Like, we don&#39;t and never did have bedtimes, but there are physical limits on how late my husband and I can stay up with little kids without things being unsafe for them. It took a while to realize that we should just do what makes overall life run more smoothly if it results in happier people, so after a certain hour of night, there is a push toward bed and sleep - with tons of flexibility built in and gentleness, and the knowledge on my part that the flexibility and freedom will only grow as they are older and able to stay-up alone without us. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I think I&#39;ve taken this thread off-topic.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling Book Recommendation","postDate":"1292098284","msgId":58435,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxNTQ4Ny45OTc5OS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMy5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU4MkRFNEFDLUYxM0MtNDIzNS05MDMzLTMzOUY2RjVDMkZCOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGllMGMwMSt0c2YzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTgyREU0QUMtRjEzQy00MjM1LTkwMzMtMzM5RjZGNUMyRkI5QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58434,"nextInTopic":58438,"prevInTime":58434,"nextInTime":58436,"topicId":58432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Shira you are welcome to come visit us here in Minnesota!   Alex Polikowsky [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-28100449\">Hey Shira you are welcome to come visit us here in Minnesota!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling Book Recommendation","postDate":"1292092890","msgId":58434,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4MkRFNEFDLUYxM0MtNDIzNS05MDMzLTMzOUY2RjVDMkZCOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGllMGMwMSt0c2YzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGllMGMwMSt0c2YzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58433,"nextInTopic":58435,"prevInTime":58433,"nextInTime":58435,"topicId":58432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-And, given all of the controversy out on the internet about what unschooling actually is... are there books that you think got it wrong?-=- Is there new","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1765951596\">-=-And, given all of the controversy out on the internet about what unschooling actually is... are there books that you think got it wrong?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there new controversy?
