It is like any other stage and age in life  - it <br/>\ncomes on gradually, and you get to adjust.  My five kids are spaced  over 17 <br/>\nyears .  That has meant that they&#39;ve left gradually (which I think  is easier to <br/>\nadjust to than if they all left quickly).  The key for me is  that they were <br/>\nready to go, and in many ways I was ready to have them  leave.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt happens in steps.  First they started with jobs/and/or  college.  That <br/>\nmeans they are gone for periods of time.  Of  course before this they were <br/>\ninvolved in their own lives so that we weren&#39;t  spending as much time together - and <br/>\ndoing things like going on field trips or  park days was no longer a part of <br/>\nour relationship.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs I watch them function in their young adult lives I feel very grateful  for <br/>\ntwo things - one, that we did have SO much time together in their early  <br/>\nyears, and two, that they have such a secure sense of themselves that they can  <br/>\nmanage so well out in the &quot;real&quot; world.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMy situation is somewhat different because there has been a divorce in the  <br/>\nmix too, but I am enjoying (usually!!  :-) ) the new &quot;challenges&quot; in my  life <br/>\nnow that I am focussing on developing more income and my new partner  <br/>\nrelationship.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is like looking back on the days of nursing.  By the time they  weaned, <br/>\nboth the child and I were ready for that to happen.   Not to mean that I didn&#39;t <br/>\nlove nursing them, but we were both ready to move  on.  It is like that -- you <br/>\nstill get to have a relationship with them, it  just shifts somewhat as they <br/>\nbecome more independent and  self-sufficient.<br/>\n <br/>\nDo I look back and remember how wonderful the earlier times were?   <br/>\nCertainly!!  But I also watch the intense parenting that young children  need, and it <br/>\nmakes me tired just to be an observer!!
