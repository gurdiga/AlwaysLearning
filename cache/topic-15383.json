It was hot, lot&#39;s of traffic, kinda smelly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went out to Florence to see my friend.   The Bitterroot is a big and<br/>\nbusy place these days. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to Caras park and tossed a Frisbee for a Jack Russell who&#39;s<br/>\nperson had worn out.  I threw it as long as I could and then Dylan threw<br/>\nit and then we all sprawled in the grass while the dog harassed other<br/>\npark goers.  His person said she expects us back there this afternoon,<br/>\nsame time, ready to go.  We probably won&#39;t make the eighty four mile<br/>\ndrive as Dylan would miss his Tae Kwon Do class. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry you&#39;re missing Montana.  We&#39;ll remember you to Glacier park when we<br/>\nget there.  I can send you a Missoulian or an Independent if you want. <br/>\nOr, maybe a nice bottle of wine from Lolo Peak Winery?<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 928","postDate":"1057160551","msgId":15383,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJCMjhCNzg1LjI5RUUlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNTcxMzgwMTMuMTUzNC41NDE0Ny5tMTJAeWFob29ncm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":15385,"prevInTime":15382,"nextInTime":15384,"topicId":15383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
