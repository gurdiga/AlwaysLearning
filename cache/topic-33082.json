First off, I had never been asked for my diploma---ever---until a <br/>\nfew years ago when we joined a homeschool accountability association <br/>\n(to homeschool in SC). That association required that I produce one. I <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t. I know I have mine somewhere. I thought it was in my <br/>\nscrapbook from high school, but it never materialized; so I had to <br/>\ncontact my high school and ask for a copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey don&#39;t have any. And they wouldn&#39;t make a up a special one for me. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they *could* give me was a *transcript*.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I wasn&#39;t so all-fired up about sending this association my high <br/>\nschool transcript, but there simply wasn&#39;t an alternative at the time. <br/>\nSo I did. Now I *run* an association, and I don&#39;t require that the <br/>\n&quot;teaching-parent&quot; send me an actual copy of her transcript OR diploma. <br/>\nJust a guarantee that she has one is fine enough for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone here actually ever been asked to produce a diploma??? For <br/>\nANY job???<br/>\n<br/>\nA diploma is simply a piece of paper. States that you have completed <br/>\nthe requirements of that school. High schools have different <br/>\nrequirements. Colleges don&#39;t even require diplomas---they actually want <br/>\ntranscripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a generic job application a while back. It doesn&#39;t ask whether <br/>\nyou have a *diploma*---it asks level of education: some high school, <br/>\nhigh school graduate, some college, college graduate, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Original Poster: If you would like a diploma for your child, <br/>\nplease send me your child&#39;s name, your homeschool&#39;s name, and $29.95, <br/>\nplus shipping and handling. I will calligraphy a piece of <br/>\nparchment---tied up in a BOW even (what are your homeschool&#39;s colors?). <br/>\nIf you act NOW!, I&#39;ll make TWO diplomas! Two for the low, low price of <br/>\n$29.95! (plus s&h) That&#39;s in case your child ever needs to homeschool <br/>\n*her* children in the state of SC!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs as a &quot;special gift,&quot; I will throw in a FREE bumper sticker that <br/>\nsays: &quot;The Truly Educated Never Graduate&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32919,"nextTopicId":33068}}
