Leaders are people who go their own way<br/>\nwithout caring, or even looking to see, whether anyone is following them.<br/>\n&quot;Leadership qualities&quot; are not the qualities that enable people to<br/>\nattract followers, but those that enable them to do without them. They<br/>\ninclude, at the very least, courage, endurance, patience, humor,<br/>\nflexibility, resourcefulness, stubbornness, a keen sense of reality, and<br/>\nthe ability to keep a cool and clear head, even when things are going<br/>\nbadly. True leaders, in short, do not make people into followers, but<br/>\ninto other leaders. &quot;<br/>\nJohn Holt</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20663,"nextTopicId":20704}}
