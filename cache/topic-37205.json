She knows","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1448550648\">Holly knows the difference between everyday (an adjective) and every  <br/>\nday (an adverbial phrase) but she doesn&#39;t know that latter term, I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t think.  She knows if you&#39;re telling what kind of thing (an  <br/>\neveryday dress or an everyday occurrence) it&#39;s one word, and if  <br/>\nyou&#39;re telling when you do it, you might do so every day).   That&#39;s  <br/>\nsomething being lost among the 30-somethings of the world.  But  <br/>\nEnglish changes.  It always has.  Victorian grammar books tried to  <br/>\nput the brakes on it, but it&#39;s too large an omnibus even for those  <br/>\n19th century Brits who were *sure* their culture was the highest and  <br/>\nbest possible expression of mankind.    Others bought into their self- <br/>\nsatisfaction, though, too, and STILL kids are pressed to read  <br/>\nTreasure Island as a classic piece of literature.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that in another thread but I pulled it out to start a new trail.<br/>\n<br/>\n*************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nEven with grammar, there is history and culture and geography.  (With  <br/>\neverything there is everything, and with every single topic can come  <br/>\nevery other topic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEngland in the late 19th century was pretty damned proud of itself  <br/>\nand Victoria was &quot;By the Grace of God, Queen of the United Kingdom of  <br/>\nGreat Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Empress of  <br/>\nIndia.&quot;   She had some other titles too, but no matter.   If they  <br/>\nwere the greatest power ever (as they were quite sure they were),  <br/>\nthen their language and culture must be the big IT.   So Australia  <br/>\nand New Zealand and Canada and even the U.S. tended to want to keep  <br/>\nup with or be up on the in crowd with English as it should be, I  <br/>\nthink, and that all happened with books.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading Dickens was cool because he wrote sometimes in other  <br/>\ndialects, but it was clear that the narrator was the &quot;right&quot;  <br/>\ndialect.   Mark Twain was doing some of the same in the U.S. a little  <br/>\nlater.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe (all English-speaking countries) would have drifted much further  <br/>\napart linguistically had it not been for radio, TV and movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think the Victorians and the state of the economy and  the  <br/>\nindustrial age making paper production and printing less expensive  <br/>\nand whatever all advances were involved with linotype machines and  <br/>\nall that--it was a way to solidify language.   MANY people thought  <br/>\nthis was good, and good enough, and English should be and stay  <br/>\ncodified.   It was like damming up a river, though.  You can&#39;t keep  <br/>\nALL the water in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a balance, a tension, between conservatism and radicalism,  <br/>\nbetween &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go,&quot; between<br/>\nTIME OUT.   I was talking to Kirby the other day by phone about using  <br/>\nsemi-colons to punctuate series sometimes, and this is one of those  <br/>\ntimes I&#39;m going to, but before I take that sentence and revise it  <br/>\n(not study it for a test, as &quot;revise&quot; means in England, but change  <br/>\nit) I&#39;m going to say that I need to send this to Kirby now, because I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a reason then to tell him that although commas usually go  <br/>\ninside quotes, semi-colons never do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBacking up and going again:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a balance, a tension, between conservatism and radicalism;  <br/>\nbetween &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot;; between tradition and slang.   That  <br/>\ncompromise is what makes things grow at a pace people can follow.   <br/>\nSome people don&#39;t want a single &quot;rule&quot; to change.  Some want ALL the  <br/>\nrules to change.  And so some of the rules change.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.  I wrote &quot;STILL kids are pressed to read Treasure Island as a  <br/>\nclassic piece of literature.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTreasure Island is fine, but the writing is archaic and the sentences  <br/>\nare L-o-n-g and it takes forever to get to action.  At the time it  <br/>\nwas new, it was like Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark.   In an  <br/>\nage when kids can play video games where they can make decisions to  <br/>\nchange the action, Treasure Island is an antique.  It inspired some  <br/>\nreally great illustrations.  It almost single-handedly fuels &quot;talk  <br/>\nlike a pirate day.&quot;</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":37145,"nextTopicId":37224}}
