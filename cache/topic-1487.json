Where are the interesting conversations we&#39;ve come to <br/>\nexpect? Is unschooling falling out of favor? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m a diehard unschooler because I intend to hold firm to the opinion <br/>\nthat unschooling really is the best way to go. Perhaps others are secure in <br/>\ntheir beliefs as well and do not feel the need to check in regularly. <br/>\nWhatever the case may be, let&#39;s do what we can to make sure unschooling is <br/>\npresented to new-comers in a fair and accurate way so that this valuable <br/>\nlearning philosophy can endure. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone here posted this, I don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do hope that some of the great writers here who haven&#39;t been on <br/>\nwww.unschooling.com for whatever reason will consider going there from time <br/>\nto time to help new people understand it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fine for us to have this list, or other list, where we can word-wrestle <br/>\nand tell stories with people who are already convinced and comfortable <br/>\nunschoolers.  I like it.  But for any of you who remember how it felt to be a <br/>\nnew unschooler or who realize that something you say could make the <br/>\ndifference between a family putting kids back in school or keeping on making <br/>\nthem &quot;do their work&quot; or changing their relationship entirely, please check in <br/>\nonce in a while to help us help newcomers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":585,"nextTopicId":1436}}
