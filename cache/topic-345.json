She doesn&#39;t ask for money or ask to work for me to make money.<br/>\nI think it started out that she just liked the idea of selling something and<br/>\nmaking money, not that she really had a want or need for it, just the idea<br/>\nof a &quot;sale&quot;.  So we picked avocadoes and she sold them when she was<br/>\n6.  She made a fortune.  Next year our friend, and avocado rancher told<br/>\nus to come pick his so we did, and the kids almost tripled their income.  <br/>\nObviously this is a little niche the children have found, they have the right<br/>\nproduct (plus its FREE) and a good location.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;This small sum would permit them not to have to feel the extent of my <br/>\nmoney-spending power all the time -- they would not be completely dependent <br/>\nupon me (except for getting them to the stores :)). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding this allowance talk informative.  I like what you have said here.<br/>\nWe don&#39;t give an allowance and I <br/>\nreally hadn&#39;t planned on it.  The way I was raised, I didn&#39;t get<br/>\none but I seldom seemed to want for anything either.  Mom paid for the show,<br/>\nor whatever.  We did garage sales and I always got stuff.  With<br/>\nthe kids it seems to be the same way.  Plus their dad leaves tons of change<br/>\naround which sometimes they ask if they can have.  If it falls from the <br/>\ndresser<br/>\nor counter, its goes to whomever finds it LOL.  I thought for a long time that<br/>\nthis was the best way, letting them come up with ways to earn money<br/>\n(but not making it too hard by letting them have the change, plus Grandma<br/>\nmoney etc). but I do sometimes like the ideas discussed with allowances.<br/>\nThey opened savings accounts from their last sale and frankly I think<br/>\nthey have forgotten about the money.  <br/>\nI have to share the cutest story today. We were at a Stationary store and<br/>\nthe kids were off shopping on their own, each carrying his/her wallet.  I<br/>\nwas on one end they on the other with calling back and forth mom? how<br/>\nmuch is this, I would go check or have them bring it to me. Half way thru<br/>\nmy shopping expedition my littlest who is 4 comes up to me telling me<br/>\nhe wants to buy this pencil. So I let him know how much it is as he gets<br/>\nin line. I stand back a ways.  He asks me to hold his balloon and I say<br/>\nno you better pay for it first.  He tells me he already payed for it.  He was <br/>\njust so cute to see standing in line like he knew his business and paying<br/>\nfor his stuff and he really didn&#39;t need me at all!  When I had been in another<br/>\npart of the store he had gotten in line and already paid for the balloon! <br/>\n <br/>\n &lt;&lt;The other part is can they do things to add to their regular amount if <br/>\nthey want to get something special? I am loathe to make regular <br/>\nkeep-the-house-running-smoothly tasks up for financial grabs, but maybe there <br/>\nare other things they could do to be entrepreneurs.... &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dd has a book on ideas for kids to make money. Something I think would<br/>\nbe really cool for a kid to do is to sell outgrown toys, games etc. on ebay.  <br/>\nMy<br/>\ndd wanted a new American Girl doll, so she sold her old one on ebay for almost<br/>\nas much as we paid for it and purchased a new one.  I think she only had<br/>\nto pay a difference of about $6 and I picked up the difference for her anyhow,<br/>\nplus I hate to have her pay for shipping so I paid for that also. Sometimes I<br/>\nthink I&#39;m not teaching her about money when I don&#39;t have her pay for those<br/>\nShipping etc. but she has little and I have more and I like to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Shopping/Money","postDate":"1008018223","msgId":481,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxMzQwMWMxODFiZSQyZjhjYTNjMCQxNDNiYWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":480,"nextInTopic":520,"prevInTime":480,"nextInTime":482,"topicId":345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"If it s a bigger thing, we ...

Slowly smiling, <br/>\nshe said, &quot;Well, the reason I cut the ends off my Christmas ham was because <br/>\nthe ham was always too big to fit into my baking pan.

Not for the store outbursts, but for general good measure -- so they can practice real choice-making that we can afford -- and so that they can see their money accumulate and disappear.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne hint I read was to offer a weekly amount (a month can be interminable for me :)). Say two dollars (or more, but with three kids and what I&#39;ll share below, this can add up quickly). In order to illustrate the power of saving and to show that shopping is not the same as buying, the parent can stipulate that whatever is left at the end of a week will be doubled (I&#39;d like that interest rate!). So if nothing is spent in a month, the child has a total of $16. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother added that to help the kids begin to think about the long-term, an additional monthly &quot;dividend&quot; could be added as well as a yearly &quot;bonus.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is a tremendous source of frustration for me. We work had for our income and I want the kids to learn that willingness and ability to work hard, so I am trying to figure out how to deal with the allowance itself. How much money? I&#39;m thinking there should be a set base amount (even if it&#39;s only 50 cents a week) they get just because they are in our family and are unable to get money any other way. This small sum would permit them not to have to feel the extent of my money-spending power all the time -- they would not be completely dependent upon me (except for getting them to the stores :)). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other part is can they do things to add to their regular amount if they want to get something special? I am loathe to make regular keep-the-house-running-smoothly tasks up for financial grabs, but maybe there are other things they could do to be entrepreneurs....<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nJennifer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Shopping/Money","postDate":"1007932180","msgId":404,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDdlLjFmNDIyMzMxLjI5NDUyZDE0QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":396,"nextInTopic":415,"prevInTime":403,"nextInTime":405,"topicId":345,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/9/01 11:53:33 AM, mjcmbrwn@ihug.co.nz writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1786676018\">In a message dated 12/9/01 11:53:33 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:mjcmbrwn@...\">mjcmbrwn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; Yes, I agree that a parent should help a child come to the understanding <br/>\nthat his behaviour is distrubing others, &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the amalgamated point (you might have deleted some?) was that at some <br/>\npoint between three and twelve (or between any age and any other later age) a <br/>\nchild develops more awareness, and while a parent shouldn&#39;t expect a three <br/>\nyear old to understand consideration for others, that if a parent treats a <br/>\ntwelve year old like a three year old it&#39;s a disservice to someone who IS <br/>\ngetting older.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome three year olds are more considerate than some twelve year olds.

I used to do that, like Sage would want <br/>\nsomething and, only half listening, I&#39;d say no. Then came a tantrum and when <br/>\nI actually paid attention, and thought about it, I could really say yes. Then <br/>\ncomes the humbling part, to tell him that I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t really paying <br/>\nattention and that it&#39;s ok with me. But I had to get over that, &quot;I have to <br/>\nmake sure he doesn&#39;t just get his way all the time&quot; thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on destroying hope, I want to really avoid that. I remember very young <br/>\nlosing the hope of asking my parents for anything, at least anything big. <br/>\nWhile they got the point across that I couldn&#39;t have everything I wanted all <br/>\nthe time, they also forgot to teach me that with enough time, planning, and <br/>\nsaving, I could get almost anything I wanted. I just had the idea that big <br/>\nthings were out of my reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current problem is that 3yo son has just suddenly taken interest in the <br/>\nlarger dollar item stuff. Up until now I&#39;ve been able to divert requests to <br/>\nsmaller dollar items in department stores and it&#39;s pretty much free reign at <br/>\ngoodwill. So I&#39;ve never really taken the time to explain to him money issues. <br/>\nBut now he&#39;s really upset at my not buying him $30 toys at each trip. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I really like what Sandra said about maybe he&#39;s needing more time and <br/>\nattention and less stuff. In fact I just recently rearranged his room and set <br/>\nup some really cool stuff in there and we&#39;ve really been spending a lot more <br/>\ntime in there, I think that&#39;s helping some.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what about money? I&#39;ve been thinking of starting an allowance for him, <br/>\nbut not sure how to go about it. I think it might help him to know/have some <br/>\ncontrol over when  we can and can&#39;t get stuff. Instead of it just being sort <br/>\nof a luck of the draw to him. I&#39;m sure it seems like sometimes I say yes and <br/>\nsometimes I say no, just because.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Let the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; strangers as much as possible. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think, when I&#39;m in a store, that the other people have the particular <br/>\n&gt; right <br/>\n&gt; to shop in peace.  I have read baffling advice from homeschooling moms (and <br/>\n&gt; some others) who are  basically saying &quot;to hell with other people; live <br/>\n&gt; your <br/>\n&gt; life with your child as though other people don&#39;t exist.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I try to let my son&#39;s tantrum run its course AND be considerate of others. I <br/>\ndon&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to other people to have to sit thru a screaming tantrum <br/>\nof a small child. On the other hand, it isn&#39;t fair to my son to tell him to <br/>\nstuff it because he&#39;s disturbing others. I try to calm him, then move to a <br/>\nbathroom, or sometimes we go outside. There have been times when we&#39;ve gone <br/>\noutside or to the car then returned to the store when things have calmed done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not been upset when dining or shopping to hear another child/baby <br/>\nstart to cry or throw a tantrum. It&#39;s life. My problem is when it continues. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrenda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":579,"nextTopicId":616}}
