From outside the religion<br/>\nsome of the religion&#39;s moral requirements can look neutral.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the problem is that what God/gods want seems -- from outside a religion<br/>\n-- to occasionally override what seems to be a more universal morality.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm, I think what&#39;s confusing is what morality is keeps slipping back and<br/>\nforth between a universal morality and what an individual defines as<br/>\nmorality. *If* moral is doing what God wants then *only* religious people<br/>\ncan be moral since no one outside the religion could independently arrive at<br/>\nthe non-universal morals like keeping the Sabbath holy or how to keep it<br/>\nholy or even that a Sabbath existed or what a Sabbath was or what that<br/>\nparticular God meant by holy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the statement was made outside of religion, they apparently accept<br/>\nthat there&#39;s a universal morality. (For example be kind, be compassionate.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Unless your religion&#39;s basic premise is that God wants us to do right, which<br/>\n&gt; is, of course, what a religious person believes. Then figuring out what is<br/>\n&gt; right is the same as figuring out what God wants us to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If God&#39;s morality and a universal morality are one and the same, then doing<br/>\n(universally) right, being (universally) moral and doing God&#39;s will are all<br/>\none and the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* God has additional requirements in order to be considered moral by<br/>\nGod&#39;s standards, especially requirements relating to our relationship with<br/>\nGod, then those extra requirements aren&#39;t derivable from living life from<br/>\nthe point of view of a universal morality, like being kind to each other.<br/>\nThey can only be gotten from reading a particular God&#39;s words.<br/>\n<br/>\n*If* what God wants includes overriding universal morals based on what God<br/>\nwants -- not necessarily what makes sense from a universal moral point of<br/>\nview -- then that person is moral if they do what God says but not moral by<br/>\nuniversal standards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Old Testament God wanted the Jews to crush the people living in<br/>\nIsrael because God promised that land to the Jews. So apparently for God it<br/>\nbeing moral to treat some humans as lesser than other humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Bhagavadgita the god/aspect of god, Krishna, spends the book<br/>\nconvincing the prince, who is siding with the morals of the priestly caste<br/>\nthat killing is wrong, that it is the prince&#39;s moral duty to go to war<br/>\nbecause he&#39;s of the princely caste. And that birth, karma, requires him to<br/>\ndo what his position requires of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a universal morality can be overridden by what God wants, then how can a<br/>\nmoral person judge what is moral when sometimes universal morality gets<br/>\noverriden? When faced with a situation that is similar to a previous<br/>\noverride, is it okay to override for this time? (There were undoubtedly<br/>\nBiblical justifications for slavery, for instance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo viewing the supposed moral requirements from the point of view of a<br/>\nuniversal morality, those religions are requiring the followers to be<br/>\nImmoral (by universal standards) in order to be moral within that religion.<br/>\n<br/>\n::: whew! ::: I need to go rest my brain ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I took it to mean she thought you really just couldn&#39;t be religious and moral<br/>\n&gt; (do the right thing) at the same time - that one contradicted the other<br/>\n&gt; automatically. I thought she meant that BEING religious made you<br/>\n&gt; automatically immoral and being moral made you automatically NOT religious.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way I took it too. But it doesn&#39;t make any logical sense. Though<br/>\nthere is certainly data to support it, there&#39;s far more contradictory data.<br/>\nIt only makes sense as a statement of anger against something they&#39;ve been<br/>\nhurt by, sort of like calling all men pigs after a bad ending to a<br/>\nrelationship.

I was at a conference (Pam was <br/>\ntoo) which was totally NOT religious, and there were people who were picking <br/>\nup and buying, swearing to, adopting, every practice that seemed to them <br/>\nwould make them &quot;one of these people.&quot;   Like... What do New Age families <br/>\neat?  What do they do for a winter holiday?  What do they do for medicine?  <br/>\nTea?  Clothing?  There are magazines and various support groups from which a <br/>\nperson can adopt a lifestyle complete with beliefs, diet and dresscode.  <br/>\nThey&#39;ll soon know what car&#39;s good to drive, and what pets would be best, by <br/>\njust doing what&#39;s around them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s just clearer and more obvious in a church that will TELL you to <br/>\nhomeschool, and how.  (We had neighbors at our old house who went to the <br/>\ncentral homeschooling-hive church in town here.  They were homeschooling <br/>\nbecause it was a sin not to.  Their lives revolved around the church <br/>\nentirely.  Once the mom told me she didn&#39;t know what she was serving for <br/>\ndessert that night, but Jesus would provide.   I was just glad the rest of <br/>\nher church hadn&#39;t figured out her kids were mixing with mine a lot! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey ended up divorced.  She took up with a younger Jewish guy with a jacuzzi <br/>\nin his bedroom.  The husband had the kids most of the time, taking them to <br/>\nchurch extra much.   I&#39;m sorry we lost contact with them, but they moved to <br/>\nanother town.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1798873,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Re: Stepping in the hornet&#39;s nest and intro","postDate":"1008647706","msgId":840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRmLjE1OWY2YWUzLjI5NTAxODFhQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":839,"nextInTopic":842,"prevInTime":839,"nextInTime":841,"topicId":803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/17/2001 1:39:14 PM Pacific Standard Time, ...

But my point is that it is much more rare in our <br/>\ngroup for it to be the religious people, Christian or otherwise, to be the <br/>\nones who are rude.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, one thing I remember was someone saying recently: &quot;Religion and <br/>\nmorality are mutually exclusive.&quot;  Another was someone said, &quot;Religious <br/>\npeople have chosen not to think for themselves.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nThese kinds of comments leave me at a loss as to how to respond. I&#39;m not a <br/>\nChristian, I am a Baha&#39;i, but we also have several very much Christian <br/>\nfamilies in our group.

But I cringe when we have new people and these <br/>\nkinds of blanket statements are made in front of them or even to them. A very <br/>\nsweet, new-to-our-group mom - thrilled to find unschoolers and a casual <br/>\naccepting group - was really put on the spot recently when she DID respond to <br/>\nstatements like this by saying that she was a Christian and didn&#39;t feel that <br/>\nshe was being fairly represented by the kinds of statements being made. Like <br/>\nI said, she was new, the rest of us were used to these comments and would <br/>\njust let them pass us by, changing the subject. But I hate it when it happens <br/>\n- I usually find I suddenly have to go to the bathroom (to get away).<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1509055,"authorName":"Tia Leschke","from":"Tia Leschke &lt;leschke@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Re: Stepping in the hornet&#39;s nest and  intro","postDate":"1008639526","msgId":842,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUuMC4yLjEuMC4yMDAxMTIxNzE3MzQ0My4wMjNiMWE3MEBsb2NhbGhvc3Q+","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDMUUyNjg0LjdCMDQ4MDc3QGhvbWUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDg2MDY0NjcuMjQ2NC43MTYzMS5tNEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":840,"nextInTopic":882,"prevInTime":841,"nextInTime":843,"topicId":803,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
