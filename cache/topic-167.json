The question is more like: &quot;Schools highly <br/>\nvalue certain skills - writing, math, and test-taking. Outside of school, <br/>\nthough, what makes for a &quot;successful life?&quot; What is &quot;valued&quot; outside of <br/>\nschool? Well - yeah - people with lousy interpersonal skills, no appreciation <br/>\nof nature, little intrapersonal intelligence, a lack of interest in fine arts <br/>\nor beautiful language --- those people can make a bunch of money sometimes. <br/>\nBut the real question is what kind of &quot;life&quot; do they live? Not how much money <br/>\ndo they make. What is highly valued outside of school? What HAS value? Do <br/>\nthey have friends and families who value them - do they feel loved and <br/>\ncherished? Is their work of value to the world in some way - do they feel <br/>\nthey are contributing something important - does it add beauty or <br/>\nunderstanding or help people to live better or ? What is valued outside of <br/>\nschool? My expert test-taking skills are of NO value in any sense - they <br/>\ncontribute nothing to the world that is of any value whatsoever. My ability <br/>\nto sense when a child&#39;s feelings are being hurt and to be able to help them <br/>\nwork it out -- THAT is of actual real value in the world. What skills &quot;count&quot; <br/>\nin the real world? In my own real world &lt;g&gt; it is clear that those  <br/>\nintelligences not typically highly-valued in school count a LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"3KS9TqWY9F-SGa3WbIsmw66bqu6hq6nz3wzlK5RfwGXdubXGBZbpFc96vq-XsRm3giOcPAKllg","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Libraries as enemies to learning","postDate":"1007318333","msgId":183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyYS44NTZlOWQyLjI5M2JjZjNkQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":174,"nextInTopic":184,"prevInTime":182,"nextInTime":184,"topicId":167,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/1/2001 10:30:17 AM Pacific Standard Time, ...
