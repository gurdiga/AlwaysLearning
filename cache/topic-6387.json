He would sing <br/>\n&quot;Johnny Phiffer is a hero--&quot; as he jumped.  None of us knew who Johnny was.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs he grew he flew around on skateboard ramps, then did gymnastics, and <br/>\nfinally landed into springboard/tower diving.  When he took up juggling <br/>\n(between skateboarding and gym.), I thought he&#39;d be grounded.  But no.  He <br/>\ntaught himself to ride a unicycle, and then got a 6&#39; tall one to ride while <br/>\nhe juggled.  He just placed first at Nationals for Division 2 schools on the <br/>\nspringboard (Can I brag?  He not only won but did so by over 100 points- he <br/>\nwas totally amazed).  BUT, his real love is the tower (30&#39; tall - on which he <br/>\nis now concentrating for the Senior Nationals).  So you see, even tho he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t become a super hero, he is still flying.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, he&#39;s not flying this week, he&#39;s a king in a Shakespearean play that <br/>\nopens tomorrow at his college in Clarion, PA (sure wish I could be there - <br/>\nI&#39;m in CA).  He&#39;s majoring in drama.  He went to ps for kindergarden - then <br/>\ncollege.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie Colten<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6378,"nextTopicId":6391}}
