It made me feel really good that I let my kids decide what they want to play with. I have donated","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-674543954\">This article did make me think, so thank you for posting it. It made me feel really good that I let my kids decide what they want to play with. I have donated more cheap plastic toys to charity over then years than anything else. But I always let them buy cheap plastic toys if they were interested. It never lasted long and they came up with some pretty creative uses for them, sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nTheir favorite toys have been the wooden building blocks, Lego and K&#39;nex. The Lego and K&#39;nex are plastic but there is nothing like them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat bothered me in the article is that I think choices should come from the child and not the parent. I also don&#39;t think that you can dictate creativity. The parent can help think of creative ideas or expose their child to creativity but it is the child&#39;s creativity that has to be respected, not the parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy sons have always loved making forts in our house. I have a pile of old sheets and wooden clothes pins that they can use. The authors would probably love my use of old sheets and wooden clothes pins for creative play but it evolved from their ideas. I didn&#39;t buy the sheets and clothes pins and suggest that they make forts but was solving a problem. They had been using hand made quilts and heavy blankets that I didn&#39;t want covered with cat hair, and using ceramic treasures and other breakables to hold them down. They would also use the plastic toys they had been given but they hurt when the cats pull them down on your head! First we switched to an old sheet that I used for a drop cloth and then we started saving and collecting old sheets. The wooden clothespins make great clips to attach the sheets to furniture etc. We even put some hooks in the play room ceiling so they could hang sheets from them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI had looked into Waldorf but always felt that it tried to dictate creativity.

The researchers found that fewer  <br/>\nbacteria could be recovered from wooden boards infected with live  <br/>\ncultures than from plastic boards treated the same way. These results  <br/>\ncaused the researchers to question the prevailing view that plastic  <br/>\nwas more sanitary than wood; some have further interpreted the data  <br/>\nto mean that wood is, in fact, a safer material for cutting boards.  <br/>\nIn a report that followed, researchers at a U.S. Department of  <br/>\nAgriculture (USDA) lab concluded that beef bacteria on polyethylene  <br/>\nand wooden cutting boards had statistically similar patterns of  <br/>\nattachment and removal. Even so, the idea that wood is more sanitary  <br/>\nthan plastic persists and was recently reaffirmed in the food section  <br/>\nof the New York Times.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo What Is on Your Cutting Board?<br/>\nWe wanted to get our own perspective on the problem, so we asked four  <br/>\nstaff members to donate their used boards, two wooden and two  <br/>\nplastic. We found very little bacteria growing on these boards when  <br/>\nwe sampled them, so we took the boards to a local lab to have them  <br/>\nartificially inoculated with bacteria. The procedure worked as  <br/>\nfollows: A drop of the medium containing millions of bacteria was  <br/>\nplaced on the boards, the boards were left to sit for 40 minutes to  <br/>\nallow for absorption of the bacteria, and an attempt was then made to  <br/>\nremove the bacteria. In repeated tests, between 6.0 percent and 8.1  <br/>\npercent of the bacteria were recovered from the plastic and between  <br/>\n1.3 percent and 6.2 percent from the wood. Given that the number of  <br/>\nbacteria recovered from each type of board was well into the hundreds  <br/>\nof thousands, there was little to assure us that one material was  <br/>\nmuch safer than the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoap and Water to the Rescue<br/>\nScrubbing the boards with hot soapy water was a different story. Once  <br/>\nthe contaminated boards had been cleaned, we recovered an average of  <br/>\n0.00015 percent from the plastic and 0.00037 percent from the wood,  <br/>\nor fewer than 100 bacteria from each board. In a related test, we  <br/>\nwere able to transfer bacteria from contaminated, unwashed boards  <br/>\nmade from both wood and plastic to petri dishes using potatoes and  <br/>\nonions. But our most surprising discovery by far was that the  <br/>\nbacteria could persist on unwashed boards of both types for up to 60  <br/>\nhours!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat, then, is the truth about cutting boards? Both plastic and  <br/>\nwooden boards can hold on to bacteria for long periods of time. Both  <br/>\nplastic and wooden boards allow for transference of bacteria to other  <br/>\nfoods. Luckily, we found that scrubbing with hot soapy water was an  <br/>\neffective (though not perfect) way of cleaning both kinds of boards;  <br/>\nthe USDA also recommends the regular application of a solution of 1  <br/>\nteaspoon bleach per quart of water. Simply put, maintenance, not  <br/>\nmaterial, provides the greatest margin of safety. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Natural Child Article","postDate":"1216328923","msgId":36622,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU0NjNERTRELTY4RjAtNDlBRC05MTUxLUQyMEFBODBGNkJFNEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGc1b2JhMitvbWU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGc1b2JhMitvbWU0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36620,"nextInTopic":36623,"prevInTime":36621,"nextInTime":36623,"topicId":36600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So maybe the same for wooden baby toys??

BRODY<br/>\nPublished: February 10, 1993<br/>\nEVERY now and then a scientific finding flies in the face of  <br/>\nconventional wisdom. And so it was with an accidental discovery by  <br/>\nmicrobiologists at the University of Wisconsin&#39;s Food Research  <br/>\nInstitute that wooden cutting boards kill food-poisoning bacteria  <br/>\nthat survive very nicely on the plastic boards that have been widely  <br/>\npromoted for years as safer than wood.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scientists, Dean O. Cliver and Nese O. Ak, stumbled upon the  <br/>\nfinding while seeking ways to decontaminate wooden boards and make  <br/>\nthem as &quot;safe&quot; as plastic. Much to their surprise, they found that  <br/>\nwhen boards were purposely contaminated with organisms like  <br/>\nSalmonella, Listeria and Escherichia coli that are common causes of  <br/>\nfood poisoning, 99.9 percent of the bacteria died off within three  <br/>\nminutes on the wooden boards, while none died on the plastic ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen contaminated boards were left unwashed overnight at room  <br/>\ntemperature, bacterial counts increased on the plastic, but none of  <br/>\nthe organisms could be recovered from the wooden boards the next  <br/>\nmorning.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt had long been believed that disease-causing bacteria from raw  <br/>\nfoods like chicken would soak into a wooden board and be difficult to  <br/>\nremove, even when washed; then when other foods, like salad  <br/>\ningredients, that are eaten raw are cut on the same board, the  <br/>\ndangerous bacteria could be picked up by them and transferred alive  <br/>\nto the consumer. Plastic was assumed to be safer because it is  <br/>\nnonporous and contaminating organisms could be readily washed off. A  <br/>\nWord for Safety<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on the new studies, Dr. Cliver said, &quot;Wood may be preferable in  <br/>\nthat small lapses in sanitary practices are not as dangerous on wood  <br/>\nas on plastic.&quot; But he cautioned against being &quot;sloppy about safety&quot;  <br/>\nand warned cooks to be sure to wash off cutting surfaces after  <br/>\ncutting meat, chicken or fish, whether the surface used is wood or  <br/>\nplastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe researchers tested boards made from seven different species of  <br/>\ntrees and four types of plastic and found similar results: wood was  <br/>\nsafer than plastic, regardless of the materials used. Thus far,  <br/>\nhowever, the researchers have been unable to isolate the agents in  <br/>\nwood that make it so inhospitable to bacteria.--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":180234378,"authorName":"Sylvia Toyama","from":"Sylvia Toyama &lt;sylgt04@...&gt;","profile":"sylgt04","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Natural Child Article","postDate":"1216327857","msgId":36620,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEwNDg3Ny43MDk4MS5xbUB3ZWI1MzgxMS5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36619,"nextInTopic":36622,"prevInTime":36619,"nextInTime":36621,"topicId":36600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Why not supply boys with boy dolls, dollhouses that can also be converted to farmhouses or fire stations?

They go from toy to toy without spending time on any<br/>\none of them. They look to toys for amusement and distraction, not<br/>\nimaginative inspiration.  Many parents do not realize this but, when it<br/>\ncomes to toys, less is more. Having too many toys, children find it<br/>\ndifficult to become attached to them. In many families, toys are given<br/>\nall year round  purchased in supermarkets, pharmacies, zoos,<br/>\nmuseums  so that toys are no longer as special as they once were. A<br/>\nchild who is given a toy at Christmas and whp knows that another one is<br/>\nnot coming until the next birthday will invest emotionally in that toy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not found this to be true at all!  My younger daughter has lots<br/>\nof toys.  Much more than her older sister ever had, partially because we<br/>\ndidn&#39;t have a lot of money when my oldest was little, and partly because<br/>\nwhat we did have was handed down to little sister along with all the new<br/>\nstuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux remembers EVERY toy she owns.  She must have a catalog in her<br/>\nhead.  I&#39;ve heard that argument before about having less is more.  I did<br/>\ntry that with the baby dolls for a while.  I put most of the dolls away<br/>\nin a room and brought out essential stuff for one or two babies.  I<br/>\nwanted to see if that idea was actually true.  Nope!  She likes to play<br/>\nwith them all.  She has her favorites for sure, but when I&#39;ve gone<br/>\nthrough and gotten rid of toys to make room for new ones, every time, my<br/>\ndaughter knows exactly what has gone, even if she wasn&#39;t part of the<br/>\ndecision making process, more so when she was younger.  I wouldn&#39;t dare<br/>\nget rid of stuff now without her permission, she will know and ask point<br/>\nblank where things are.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux and I were watching a movie together and these people moved into<br/>\nthis huge house.  I commented about how cool it would be to have so much<br/>\nroom to explore and play and find places to hide.  Her comment?  She<br/>\nthought it would be cool because she could have more room to have more<br/>\ntoys and more room to play with her toys.  For me it was simply about<br/>\nthe space to play in, for her it was more room for more toys.<br/>\n<br/>\nLess is more, may work for some kids, but it wouldn&#39;t fly with Margaux. <br/>\nShe lives large!  Sometimes I think it&#39;s because she has the same name<br/>\nas a queen who lived pretty large and extravagent.  Not really, that&#39;s<br/>\njust a running side joke in our family.  She would make a fine queen<br/>\nthough, she has all the qualities that royalty should possess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure that I like the idea of emotionally investing in toys<br/>\neither.  I think it&#39;s natural for kids to really cherish some toys.  I<br/>\nalso think if you have very few and are very emotionally invested in<br/>\nthem, if something happens to one of them, it&#39;s devasting, like death<br/>\nfor a child.  I kind of like the idea of abundance.  My sis-in-law<br/>\nalways went through her kids toys as they were growing up and got rid of<br/>\njust about everything every year, and then they would buy new stuff to<br/>\nmeet the new demands of the kids.  There were a few times in those kid&#39;s<br/>\nlives, when they literally had no toys to play with.  They certainly got<br/>\nused to it, but I wonder sometimes how that must affect how they view<br/>\npermanance in their lives.  Those kids didn&#39;t dare become emotionally<br/>\nattatched to any of their toys!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love very much that my kids still play with stuff that I kept from<br/>\nwhen I was a kid.  My favorite stuffed animal, was Margaux&#39;s favorite<br/>\nfor a long time.  She named it Curry because it was that kind of yellow.<br/>\nChamille has moved on from toys and now I give her some of my  treasured<br/>\nclothing items from my own teen years, stuff that I will never wear<br/>\nagain, but kept because I couldn&#39;t bear to part from them.  I love<br/>\nwatching her dress them up in different ways, cut them, reassemble them<br/>\nand reuse them.  None of these things are natural fibers,  even the<br/>\nstuffed animals (some of the clothes are).  Yet here they are being used<br/>\nby another generation.  There are even a few things that were my<br/>\nmother&#39;s and my grandmother&#39;s.  Those things are natural materials, and<br/>\nsome of them are wearing out and have to be handled gentley.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":166322738,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;nancywooton@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Natural Child Article","postDate":"1216316966","msgId":36610,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEE0NzY2NUQ0LTZCMUUtNDU0NS1CQTQyLURGRUFGQTUzQUQyQkBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ0QjdFQkQyLUEwNEYtNDk1Ri1CQTU3LTczMTQ0M0RCRkQwNEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ1NDk2Mi4zOTgxNC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNy5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxENEI3RUJEMi1BMDRGLTQ5NUYtQkE1Ny03MzE0NDNEQkZEMDRAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36609,"nextInTopic":36611,"prevInTime":36609,"nextInTime":36611,"topicId":36600,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

It doesn&#39;t make physical sense.   <br/>\nOne dimension is a theoretical line, and nobody can mold that in  <br/>\nplastic.  So without even getting to the real article, I&#39;m already  <br/>\nirritated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat intro isn&#39;t a quote from the article, so maybe it was written by  <br/>\nan editor.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-“Play, from toddler toys<br/>\nto adult gaming, has<br/>\nbecome such a serious<br/>\nactivity that the idea of<br/>\nfree play – play for the<br/>\npure fun of it – has gone<br/>\nthe way of stickball and<br/>\npaper dolls.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nPaper dolls were crap.<br/>\nAnd where I lived, we never played &quot;stickball,&quot; ever.  We had real  <br/>\nvacant lots and real bats.<br/>\n<br/>\nNostalgia is a way for parents to justify limiting their children,  <br/>\nand a way of them reliving their own youths, but children who will  <br/>\nmature in 2020 don&#39;t need stickball or paper dolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we overcome this dilemma?<br/>\nFor one, stand firm and try not to give in.<br/>\nDavid Elkind, author and professor of<br/>\nchild development, tells the following<br/>\nstory: “I recall pestering my mother to<br/>\nbuy a certain cereal so I could collect the<br/>\nbox tops. But my mother did not buy us<br/>\nthat cereal. I kept pestering her and complaining<br/>\nabout not having what my<br/>\nfriends had. Finally, exasperated with<br/>\nmy nagging and having housework and<br/>\nother children to deal with, my mother<br/>\nsaid firmly and conclusively, ‘Who cares<br/>\nwhat you want?’ My mother cared about<br/>\nwhat we needed but didn’t worry about<br/>\nwhat we wanted.”<br/>\n<br/>\nThat story is included to encourage parents to ignore their  <br/>\nchildren&#39;s desires.  And there&#39;s the implied promise that it could  <br/>\nlead to them becoming professors and authors!  And of course it  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t hurt David Elkind (athough it might be interesting to  <br/>\nmagically know why he grew up to study child development &lt;bwg&gt;, and I  <br/>\nsay &quot;magically&quot; because asking him might not work, if he hasn&#39;t  <br/>\nthought about it much).<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-How can we stop our children from<br/>\nbecoming targets of consumerism at an<br/>\nearly age? Select toys according to their<br/>\nplay merit – natural, imaginative, openended,<br/>\netc. – instead of their brand<br/>\nnames.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brand names is he talking about?  Discovery Toys?  Fisher  <br/>\nPrice?  Playskool?  Duplo?  I really don&#39;t know.  But I don&#39;t know  <br/>\nanyone who has chosen toys just by brand name. I do know a mom who  <br/>\nchose toys that matched her decor:  Primary colors, no pastels.  And  <br/>\nI&#39;m sure there have been a few moms who had pastel nurseries and  <br/>\navoided primary colors, but I haven&#39;t met them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If children are<br/>\nfirst exposed to toys made of natural materials,<br/>\nthey will have a healthy standard<br/>\nby which to judge synthetics.<br/>\nWhy not let our children experience<br/>\nwooden animals or blocks and cotton and<br/>\nwool dolls or puppets?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about rubber?  That&#39;s natural.  I have three toys saved from my  <br/>\nchildhood, two from my infancy.  I have a rubber Indian with a  <br/>\ntomahawk (VERY non-PC, and it stopped squeaking just a few years  <br/>\nago.  I was already 50.  It did last a while), a teddy bear (not  <br/>\nrubber--all cloth but the eyes), and a Tiny Tears doll--rubber body,  <br/>\nprobably a kind of hard papier-mache head.  Not plastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy totally skipped the main toy materials of the mid-20th  <br/>\ncentury:  steel and rubber.  I cut the corner of one of my fingers  <br/>\noff--not the bone, just flesh and nail--with a toy ironing board.  It  <br/>\nwas steel pipe that folded up and didn&#39;t have a cap on it.  So it was  <br/>\na lever with a sharp end.   Hooray!  But it was metal, and so &quot;natural.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Why not let our children experience<br/>\nwooden animals or blocks and cotton and<br/>\nwool dolls or puppets? When machine<br/>\nmade toys are in such abundance, handcrafted<br/>\ntoys take on a new value and significance.<br/>\nThey reunite us with the real<br/>\nworld.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the family doesn&#39;t feel separate from the real world to begin  <br/>\nwith.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey also teach us environmental responsibility.<br/>\nUnfortunately, most hightech<br/>\nor plastic toys are not fixable. We<br/>\nused to be able to prop the toy open, replace<br/>\na spring or elastic or glue it back together.<br/>\nVoila, the toy was as good as<br/>\nnew. Today, we endure toys that have a<br/>\nshort lifespan and cannot be fixed;<br/>\nbuying a new toy is cheaper than fixing<br/>\nthe old one, so we simply toss it away. If<br/>\nwe are to help children learn the meaning<br/>\nof sustainability, this must change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a good point.  I wonder if that family owns any of the other  <br/>\nnot-worth-fixing things that are around these days?  Microwave, DVD  <br/>\nplayer, computers are just about at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith and I have repaired many plastic toys, by heating a wire and  <br/>\nputting it through the plastic to pin a leg or whatever had come  <br/>\noff.  We&#39;ve glued them, too.  I understand the author&#39;s point, but  <br/>\nit&#39;s again assuming all natural-material toys are repairable.  Marty  <br/>\nloved a hippo he had, but the cloth was cheap and it was stuffed with  <br/>\nsawdust-like stuff, and when it started to leak I couldn&#39;t fix it.   <br/>\nEvery stitch tore the cloth.  So when you go with natural materials,  <br/>\nget GOOD ones. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Why not supply boys with boy dolls, dollhouses that can also<br/>\nbe converted to farmhouses or fire stations? Can young girls not<br/>\nenjoy boats and trains rather than pink castles and princesses? Can<br/>\nwe not find a healthy balance?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJust earlier this month Holly and Sophie played with our Fisher Price  <br/>\npeople, and the boys always did too when they were little.  We got  <br/>\nmost of it used, and there&#39;s a filling station, airport, parking  <br/>\ngarage, farm, playground, houses, all kinds of cars--lots of non- <br/>\ngender-specific play.  But although the really old dolls have wooden  <br/>\nbodies, most of it&#39;s plastic.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Pre-programmed electronic toys monopolize the brain and<br/>\nnegatively impact children’s creativity when they demand response<br/>\nto a scenario constructed by someone else.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is true of electronic toys that only have one outcome and no  <br/>\ncreativity allowed, like quiz games.    But it&#39;s not true of all  <br/>\nelectronic toys.  Holly&#39;s on another Harvest Moon jag.  Now she&#39;s on  <br/>\nGame Boy because she can take it with her (she took me to the dentist  <br/>\nthe other morning, and was playing there while she waited).  One of  <br/>\nthe most fun things with that is to figure out what happens when you  <br/>\n&quot;play wrong,&quot; because the programmers have taken it all into  <br/>\nconsideration so that there aren&#39;t dead ends or program-stopping  <br/>\nmoves, and some of it&#39;s cute and funny.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-So let’s encourage our children to go out and play, rather than<br/>\nsitting glued to the TV or computer game. Their health, social and<br/>\nintellectual development will benefit.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nA few things:  &quot;Let&#39;s encourage our children&quot; reminds me of a nurse  <br/>\nasking &quot;How are we feeling?&quot;  &quot;We&quot; don&#39;t need to do anything as a group.<br/>\nAnd &quot;glued to the TV&quot; is not something anyone wants.  But he&#39;s  not  <br/>\nsaying --Bring your kids in and don&#39;t leave them outside glued to a  <br/>\nbike, or glued to a tree, or glued to the sandbox.--  The loaded  <br/>\nphrasing is saved for &quot;the bad guys.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd do children need to &quot;go out&quot; to play?  And why can&#39;t parents go  <br/>\nout too?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a reminder to young parents that it&#39;s good to have all kinds of  <br/>\ntoys, and that imagination is good, it&#39;s a good article.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh!  The author has something to sell:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Peter Emmenegger “Nurturing the Playful Mind” Page 24<br/>\nis the father of two young children. He owns an e-store  <br/>\nwww.inquisitivekid.ca, which carries natural<br/>\ntoys and furniture. He believes that toys that are pure in form and  <br/>\ncolor foster imagination<br/>\nand instill independence and a desire to accomplish, and that we can  <br/>\nmake the world a better<br/>\nplace, one child at a time, by giving kids what they really need.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s okay.  My kids had lots of wooden toys.  We had a big basket  <br/>\nof &quot;medieval toys&quot;--things that kids in the Middle Ages might have  <br/>\nhad--that we took to SCA events.  Everything in there was wood or  <br/>\nmetal or cloth, and appropriate to the period.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not  <br/>\naware of the differences, and we did have very many wooden toys, and  <br/>\ncloth to play with for costumes.  Marty just lately went to a party  <br/>\nand part of his costume was a big rectangle of dark blue silky cloth  <br/>\n(though not real silk) that was in the dress-up box.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with the idea of having a range and letting children  <br/>\nchoose.   If anyone here thinks the Waldorf philosophy of colors and  <br/>\ntextures is what their child really needs (because that author is  <br/>\nstrong into parents knowing what kids need), then there&#39;s a world of  <br/>\nsupport (and sales) to help you live a Waldorf life.
