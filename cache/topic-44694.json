While I thought I was trying to make learning fun and<br/>\ninteresting, I still had one thing in common with public school. I was<br/>\ntrying to *make* her learn. even if I was asking her what she wanted to<br/>\nlearn. And even though my younger two have no problems telling me what they<br/>\nlike and don&#39;t like and what they want to learn about and don&#39;t (my 7 year<br/>\nold announced last night he doesn&#39;t really like the book we&#39;re all reading<br/>\ntogether- Stuart Little - and would rather I read Magic Treehouse to him by<br/>\nourselves J) I&#39;m still driving myself crazy doing lesson plans and flipping<br/>\nthrough workbooks (and buying workbooks! UGH!) trying to find the perfect<br/>\npage that looks fun for them or deciding what we &quot;need&quot; to be learning, only<br/>\nto hear moans and groans from them. So I really thought about it. seriously,<br/>\ndid I need lesson plans to teach them to walk, talk, use the &quot;potty&quot;, ride<br/>\ntheir bikes, sing their abc&#39;s, recognize shapes, count, write their names.<br/>\nNO! They learned these things through play and everyday living, and all on<br/>\ntheir own time scale, might I mention. For instance, my middle daughter had<br/>\nno interest in potty training. I tried to force it and have her trained by 2<br/>\n&quot;like the books say&quot;, until I realized that it really didn&#39;t matter, put her<br/>\nback in diapers, and she told me when she was ready to &quot;go potty&quot;. My son<br/>\npotty-trained early, but preferred to use the back yard (LOL). He rode his<br/>\nbike much younger than the girls, but my oldest walked the youngest and my<br/>\nmiddle daughter has always had the largest vocabulary. Anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I sat them down this morning, while they were playing games on the<br/>\ncomputer and thinking I had forgotten that today was a &quot;school day&quot; and told<br/>\nthem that I had been thinking. I didn&#39;t mention the unschooling community to<br/>\nthem, so they wouldn&#39;t think, &quot;Oh goodness. Mom&#39;s been on the internet<br/>\nagain.&quot; I told them that I&#39;d been thinking about how we learn and what we<br/>\nlearn and how we&#39;d learned things in the past. I told them that I didn&#39;t<br/>\nthink it was necessary that we use workbooks and textbooks. I also made it<br/>\nvery clear that I wanted their opinion on my ideas and that I was open to<br/>\nhowever they wanted to do things; if they enjoyed workbooks and textbooks<br/>\nthen they were free to continue with them, even if just for certain<br/>\nsubjects. I told them that I think we spend too much time at home instead of<br/>\nat museums and shows and the park. I told them that there are so many neat<br/>\nmovies we could be watching together during the day, or fun games on the<br/>\ncomputer, or doing more art projects which they all really enjoy. My younger<br/>\ntwo were thrilled with the idea of putting away the workbooks and &quot;playing&quot;<br/>\nall day. I made sure they understood that we would still be learning, but<br/>\nthat we didn&#39;t have to plan what we would learn, it would just happen. And<br/>\nsome things we would make happen by planning trips or renting certain<br/>\nmovies, whatever interested them that day. To my surprise, my 6th grader<br/>\nperked up at the conversation. at first she was hesitant, and said that<br/>\nthere&#39;s no way she could learn what she needed to without reading a book,<br/>\nand how did I expect her to learn as much science just by visiting museums<br/>\n(she really said that, can you believe it?). so we talked about museums and<br/>\nall the different kinds we have around us and all the other ways to learn<br/>\nabout something. She asked if she would still write stories, and I told her<br/>\nof course! We could all sit around some days with our notebooks and write<br/>\nstories to share with each other, and then illustrate them if we wanted to.<br/>\nWe could take all day, or 30 minutes. Then I explained to her that when we<br/>\ngo back through the stories and edit and revise, she would be learning about<br/>\ngrammar. she asked, &quot;Mom, how am I going to learn all the names of stuff by<br/>\ndoing that. my books talk about reflexive pronouns and demonstrative&quot; (and<br/>\nshe threw out other words to me that I don&#39;t remember). I told her that if I<br/>\nwas being honest, there are lots of things that I don&#39;t remember the exact<br/>\nname or classification, but that I am an excellent writer which means I know<br/>\nhow to use them in my sentences. She said that made sense. she is also a<br/>\ngood writer, and wasn&#39;t exactly sure why she had to memorize ALL the<br/>\nclassifications of every word. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis part is funny. she has agreed to giving this whole &quot;learning is fun&quot;<br/>\nthing a shot since there isn&#39;t much of the &quot;school year left&quot;. (while we&#39;re<br/>\nmaking progress, obviously we still have a little bit to go! LOL)<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we boxed up all the workbooks and textbooks today, except for the ones<br/>\nthey like that have fun little activities. filled the shelves in the office<br/>\ninstead with all of our games and crossword puzzles, mad libs, art stuff,<br/>\nblocks, etc. We had some shopping to do at Target, so we picked up some fun<br/>\n&quot;educational&quot; games while we were there. a couple of games for their<br/>\nNintendo DS&#39;s and one for the Wii, along with shovels and wild flower seeds<br/>\nto plant in the garden, a &quot;sea-monkey&quot; acquarium (I still don&#39;t know what<br/>\nthat is!), a microscope. all stuff they wanted. We&#39;re going to the Farmer&#39;s<br/>\nMarket in town tomorrow, and to the planetarium on Saturday (my younger two<br/>\nare enthralled with space and stars right now). <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI still have to consciously work on my thinking, too. like the fact that<br/>\nit&#39;s ok if we go to the planetarium on Saturday instead of during the week,<br/>\nbecause &quot;school&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;Monday-Friday&quot;. we can learn every day<br/>\n(isn&#39;t it funny that we actually think we can&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; on the weekends when<br/>\nwe&#39;re involved in public school!) But I feel like I&#39;ve made (or am making)<br/>\nthe plunge, and finally on the right track. <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you guys for all your kind words, encouragement, advice, kick in the<br/>\npants, and whatever else you threw my way! I&#39;ll have lots more questions,<br/>\nbut I know that I will always get great answers with this group!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44605,"nextTopicId":44702}}
