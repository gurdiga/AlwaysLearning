Pucca is an animated 10 year old girl in a South Korean cartoon. My 6 year old son found episodes on Netflix streaming. He then asked to find YouTube stuff on it and found out through that about various Pucca apps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you have a 7 year old girl, but I started playing the game myself and i love it. I do this when he finds something new because he gets totally, utterly immersed in whatever his new thing is and if I don&#39;t check it out pretty thoroughly, within a week of finding something new, it is like he is speaking another language and he talks constantly about whatever he is into and then it drives me crazy. So, to mitigate that, I try to learn about it too, so I can understand what he is talking about! And sometimes, I love it as much as he does. Pucca doesn&#39;t have a lot of instruction, so you have to muddle through initially.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother unschooling mom I know introduced my to another app called Tiny Tower, which is really cool, but requires some reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Fatim Walji &lt;waljif@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Hello everybody,<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; I have been on this list for over a year now and I am on the path of unschooling my three kids.

Today I am writing you about my daughter who is seven and has never been to school.  In June when I asked her if she was happy at home or wanted to go to school, she said that she wanted to be home.  She also said that school was boring and you had to sit for so long listening to a mean teacher.  I was glad that she had resolved the issue because we had this conversation before.  All summer they were playing with their friends in the neighboorhood for the whole day and know she wants to try it.  So I am willing to let her go.<br/>\n <br/>\nBut at the same time I am thinking that I might not have made the house fun for her.  She has been wanting to play more online games.  I have been looking but I can not find exactly what she wants.  She would like something that would involve dress up, hair cuts, make up, cooking.  We have found some cooking games on the ipad that she likes but I was wondering what other girls play.  She also loves to play with her baby dolls and everything that involves a baby.<br/>\n <br/>\nA while back Meredith had posted how her daughter loved playing with the regular dishes for tea party instead of the kids one.  Before that I never thought about letting my daughter do that or even give her the idea.  It was just something that never crossed my mind.  When I gave her the idea she went through a phase of that and it was great I was happy for her.  She still does it once in a while.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is ideas like this that I am looking for.<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n <br/>\nFatim <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n  \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62844,"nextTopicId":62876}}
