Some things  <br/>\nstill take more... concentration and effort to be joyful while doing, but it  <br/>\ngets easier with time-and the rewards are wonderful. When I first started  <br/>\ncontemplating the idea, I thought, &quot;If I had to do the chores when I was a kid,  and <br/>\nI&#39;m doing them for my kids so they don&#39;t have to do them, when is it *my*  <br/>\nturn?!&quot; But once I got over that idea that it was turn-based or that I was owed  <br/>\n&quot;time off&quot; from chores, it got easier. In a way, I still pick up candy <br/>\nwrappers  on the floor for my inner child, but it is also partly for my kids. I  <br/>\nwholeheartedly believe they will get more from observing me do it and living in  <br/>\na house with a picked-up carpet than if I yell and &quot;make them&quot; pick it up  <br/>\nbecause &quot;they dropped it&quot;. Well, they&#39;d probably &quot;get&quot; the same from either  <br/>\nmethod, but I prefer they &quot;get&quot; the former than the latter. With the latter  <br/>\nthey&#39;ll learn resentment and grumpiness and bigger/older folks being able  to boss <br/>\nlittler, less powerful folks. With the joyful method they&#39;ll learn that  we <br/>\ncan do things for others out of joy, love and wanting to be helpful, and that  <br/>\nstrings don&#39;t have to be attached to everything.<br/>\n <br/>\nThey grow up too fast.
