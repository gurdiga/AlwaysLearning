It&#39;s the final <br/>\ndraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe talk went pretty well, considering. I was unsure what to wear. As a <br/>\nmember of LLL and being a chair on the LLL committee I know at those <br/>\nconferences I have to wear something fairly nice but I am not a member <br/>\nof CHN and this was a homeschooling conference and I am a volunteer <br/>\nspeaker, I decided to wear my nice jeans. The girls had on their <br/>\nmatching tie dye long sleeved shirts and so I threw on a tie dye shirt. <br/>\nI had just finished Janene hair a few days before, adding purple <br/>\nextensions to her braids, it looks absolutely lovely but, I admit now, <br/>\nhardly conservative. Lexie still has her two Annie braids, I was going <br/>\nto put her blue extentions into her hair but we are visiting my <br/>\ngrandparents tomorrow and Lexie felt that Janene&#39;s purple hair was <br/>\nenough for my grandparents to handle, that they might not be able to <br/>\ndeal with her having blue braids as well, so she said she&#39;d wait until <br/>\ntomorrow night. Anyway, so here we are, in tie dye and purple braids. I <br/>\nshow up just before the talk starts, Janene is not with me, she has <br/>\nfound a friend and her baby and went with them for a bit. I do have <br/>\nLexie and Savannah, another homeschooled child who is a girl scout and <br/>\nwanted to attend with us. I sit down next to two boy scout women, one of <br/>\nwhich does cub scouts and the other boy scouts. On the other side of me <br/>\nis another woman, dressed in red white and blue. In front of me at the <br/>\nfront table are these little girls that have similar uniforms on, but <br/>\nthey reminded me of the photos you see of the young hitler youth, lots <br/>\nof red white and blue. Flag waving, as my dad calls it. I was <br/>\nimmediately uncomfortable. I look at the binder the adult has in front <br/>\nof her and it has on it the words &quot;American Heritage Girls&quot; (go to <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ahgonline.org/\">http://www.ahgonline.org/</a> to see about this organization) I have no idea <br/>\nwho she is, I&#39;ve never heard of this organization but I figure, what the <br/>\nhell.. I&#39;m here. I had decided on my way in that I was going to <br/>\nintroduce myself not as a representative of girl scouts, but instead as <br/>\na homeschooler who happens to be a girl scout leader, with the idea that <br/>\nI am talking about how girl scouts fits into our homeschool life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we begin. The moderator is one of the speakers, she introduces us <br/>\nall and as she is doing this I see a cockroach about 6 inches from her <br/>\non her notebook. I quietly point it out to her thinking if it gets on <br/>\nher without her knowledge that would be worse, but she was pretty <br/>\nfreaked out by it and I finally got a napkin and snatched the poor <br/>\nthing, all the while making light of it. Did I say this session was <br/>\nbeing taped? I said something about how I hoped it hadn&#39;t escaped from <br/>\nthe hands on bug workshop. I had to leave the room to throw it away. I <br/>\ndid find it interesting that I was the only one who was OK with taking <br/>\ncare of the bug issue calmly. hmmm<br/>\n<br/>\nSo then it&#39;s the lovely lady who is with the Amican Heritage Girls time <br/>\nto speak. She announces that her program was begun because there were a <br/>\ngreat deal of Christains who believed that girl scouts were moving away <br/>\nfrom core values they wanted to teach their children. I&#39;m thinking, &quot;oh <br/>\ngreat.&quot; She introduces her little uniformed clad children and I&#39;m <br/>\nlooking at Lexie in her tie dye, thinking that this year&#39;s uniform for <br/>\nmany of my girl scout girls are tie dye shirts we made as a troop!<br/>\n<br/>\nI introduce myself and basically sorta read my bio and introduction <br/>\nwhich is on my sheet... below. I do say that girl scouts is for girls <br/>\nages 5 to 18, that men can be and are girl scouts, that it&#39;s where <br/>\n&quot;girls grow strong&quot;, etc. And I say, almost word for word, the <br/>\nfollowing: . It is a place where they can learn to be strong women; <br/>\nwhere they can learn to be leaders. GS do not, by policy, discriminate <br/>\nfor ANY reason, including sexual orientation or how a girl or her family <br/>\nmight believe. The GS program is flexible, so all girls, regardless of <br/>\npersonal belief systems or lifestyle, can join and benefit. The only <br/>\npeople who are barred membership are boys.&quot; Ok, got that out of the way...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we take questions. At about this time, my friend brings back <br/>\nJanene, who joins me at the podium. As we all are fielding questions, <br/>\nJanene gets out paper and pencil and is drawing under the table, which <br/>\nas a long table cloth on it. Every so often she pops up between my knees <br/>\nand asks me a question or gets a grape out of the bag Janene is not a <br/>\nquiet sit in a chair and not move child, but she&#39;s doing pretty good, in <br/>\nmy view. I&#39;m sure others might think differently. A bit later my friend <br/>\nAndy comes in, she&#39;s Savannah&#39;s mom. She sits down, but not next to <br/>\nSavannah as there are no chairs there. During all this time as I am <br/>\ntalking, to answer a question or whatever, Savvy or Lexie will indicate <br/>\nto me that they have something to add and I let them do so. The hitler <br/>\nlady&#39;s children didn&#39;t say a word or even act animated. The time is <br/>\nalmost gone and I&#39;m thinking to myself--good job joylyn, you have gotten <br/>\nthrough this without addressing the homosexual or athiest issue, beyond <br/>\nyour initial strong statement, this is about homeschooling, not your <br/>\npersonal feelings....and then my good friend Andy pipes up--&quot;Do you know <br/>\nanything about Circle Scouts&quot; knowning damn well that I do know about it <br/>\nand where it will lead. At dinner later she told me she just had to do <br/>\nthat. She says this with a big grin, she&#39;s a UU and a bit of a <br/>\ntroublemaker, in such a good way, I like her so! So I talked about them <br/>\nfor a bit, as an alternative. Someone asked why we would need an <br/>\nalternative and I said &quot;The boy scouts actively discriminate against <br/>\nboys and adults who do not believe in a higher power and those who are <br/>\ngay.&quot; Of course, this started something. One paramilitary man, obviously <br/>\na die hard boy scout, brought up the issue up north with the boy who was <br/>\nkicked out because he would not say he believed in any higher power and <br/>\ntried to make the point that boy scouts had tried everything to give him <br/>\nand out but he refused to take it (ie, he didn&#39;t ahve to say he believed <br/>\nin a GOD but he did have to say he believed in something as his higher <br/>\npower. The young man refused.) I clarified that I personally thought <br/>\nthat young man was quite brave and strong as he stood up against <br/>\npowerful adults and stuck up for his personal belief system and I found <br/>\nthat trait to be quite admirable. Not what the man wanted me to say. One <br/>\nwoman said &quot;so what do we do if we have boys and want them involved in <br/>\nan organization like boy scouts&quot; I said that I thougth boy scouts was a <br/>\ngood organization that did a lot of good for boys but that I personally <br/>\ncould not belong to or allow my children to belong to an organization <br/>\nthat actively discriminates against others for any reason, but that <br/>\nevery person needed to look into their own hearts, and examine their own <br/>\nbelief system and decide for themselves what was best for their family. <br/>\nThat was really how the talk ended.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a lot of people nodding and smiling at me and quite a few said <br/>\nafter that I was an excellent speaker and quite articulate, which is <br/>\nfunny because I often think I&#39;m a bumbling idiot, as things sometimes <br/>\ndon&#39;t come out as I wish them to or as I hear them in my head. One woman <br/>\ntalked further--her son IS in boy scouts and she had NO idea there were <br/>\nthese issues, so we talked for a bit, and then invited her to email me <br/>\nfurther. It was an interesting session. I&#39;m adding later, that there <br/>\nwere also quite a few who were obviously, as Andy put it, die hard boy <br/>\nscouts who were likely homophobic and that was one big reason they liked <br/>\nthe boy scouts, keep their sons away from those that would make them <br/>\ngay. But most were somewhere in between, and I know I made a few people <br/>\nthink.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling did come up. Someone asked about how he had heard that some <br/>\npeople use scouts as their ENTIRE schooling program. The boy scouts and <br/>\ncub scout people addressed that and then I said something like &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>\nsure why someone would want to do that, as an unschooler we are learning <br/>\nall the time, every day, in all parts of our lives, ang girl scouts just <br/>\nadds to that, but I can also see that someone could take the girl scout <br/>\nprogram and use it completely in homeschooling and that it would be a <br/>\nvery well rounded program.&quot; He then asked how a girl could learn math <br/>\nthrough the program and Savvy answered this, she talked about the math <br/>\nbadges, and such. I then added the bit about product sales, and that in <br/>\nmy opinion just living in our world today and being a part of daily life <br/>\nteaches my girls math that is meaningful to them. I also talked about <br/>\nhow the older girls manage their troop checkbooks and that I couldn&#39;t <br/>\nwait for that time period because then Lexie could also take over my own <br/>\ncheckbook and maybe it would actually balance. Unschooling is so hard <br/>\nfor people to get and I just dont&#39; understand why.... And of course, one <br/>\nwoman I spoke with later said that of course it works NOW because my <br/>\nkids are so young but by the time they were in middle school I would <br/>\nhave to do text books and worksheets with them, right? Uh, no...<br/>\n<br/>\nAndy and I had dinner, with a few other people, and Andy said it was <br/>\nmost amusing, to see me sitting between these obviously different folks, <br/>\nme in my tie dye while they were wearing their uniforms or more proper <br/>\nclothing, with Janene and her purple braids popping up every so often.<br/>\n<br/>\nso there you have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the final product, I&#39;m sure there are errors in it as well, but <br/>\nthis time I don&#39;t wish to know about them. :-) Sandra, feel free to edit <br/>\nthem out. Also, I can send you privately the document in word with <br/>\nformatting... just let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nHOMESCHOOLING AND GIRL SCOUTING<br/>\nJoylyn Fowler<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBio: I spent four years in Girl Scouts as a girl, three years in GS as <br/>\nan adult, with the last two as a leader. I am currently a leader in a <br/>\nmulti-level troop (Brownies and Juniors) with three other leaders. My <br/>\nhusband and I are unschooling our two daughters, ages 4 and 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Girl Scouts: These are my own words; these are not taken from <br/>\nthe Girl Scout Website or Literature. Girl Scouts--�Where Girls Grow <br/>\nStrong.� GS is a program that allows girls to be in an all girl <br/>\nenvironment (with exception of helpful daddies and other adult men, and <br/>\nmale siblings) In GS, girls are loved for themselves. It is a place <br/>\nwhere they can learn to be strong women; where they can learn to be <br/>\nleaders. GS do not, by policy, discriminate for ANY reason, including <br/>\nsexual orientation or how a girl or her family might believe. The GS <br/>\nprogram is flexible, so all girls, regardless of personal belief systems <br/>\nor lifestyle, can join and benefit. The only people who are barred <br/>\nmembership are boys�adult men can and are GS. GS is an all inclusive <br/>\nenvironment where our girls can learn and grow and be the best they can <br/>\nbe, learning to get along with others and helping their communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAugmentation of a Homeschooling Program through Girl Scouts<br/>\n<br/>\nReading: Girls must read in order to complete badges, but the reading <br/>\ncan go so much further. My girls have had to read to memorize various <br/>\nitems, including songs, the promise and law, and their parts in <br/>\ndifferent plays. We also read the story of Girl Scouts, and founder, <br/>\nJuliette Low. The girls are also required to read the rules for product <br/>\nsales, and, of course, the incentives they can earn by selling the <br/>\nproducts. Girls must decide how to spend the money earned by the product <br/>\nsales, and, in doing so, often do research on their various options. The <br/>\nolder the GS, the more reading is necessary. We learn to read best by <br/>\nreading those things that are important to us, and those things for <br/>\nwhich we can see practical value. Girls usually enjoy scouts; and <br/>\ntherefore the reading is valuable to them. In some cases, the reading <br/>\nmight be a bit above their comfort level, but because they are motivated <br/>\nto read, reading happens, and skills develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting: There are constant opportunities for writing. The girls in my <br/>\ntroop have written the following: thank you notes, posters for product <br/>\nsales, invitations to various ceremonies, letters for many occasions <br/>\n(including one to the President), and more. As the girls get older, GS <br/>\nencourages the girls to write notes to people who have purchased <br/>\ncookies. Again, as with reading, the writing within GS is usually <br/>\nmeaningful, practical and useful<br/>\n<br/>\nMath: The math opportunities are endless. Product sales provide lots of <br/>\nopportunities for math�both in handling money and figuring out how many <br/>\nmore boxes a girl needs to sell in order to reach your personal goal. <br/>\nDues are also vital and the even the youngest of scouts can be <br/>\nresponsible for paying her own dues. As the girls get older, they take <br/>\nan active role in troop finances. They decide how to spend the money, <br/>\nand budget the various trips, activities, and service projects as a <br/>\ntroop. At the Senior level, they actually take over the troop checking <br/>\naccount, along with their adult advisor. There are math badges at all <br/>\nlevels, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nScience: There are many science badges, at all levels. The founder of <br/>\ngirl scouts and the current folks who write GS badges must realize how <br/>\nimportant science is to girls. Girl Scouts also provides a wonderful <br/>\nsetting (all girls, nothing but girls) for the learning of science and <br/>\nmath. Ecology and the natural environment are stressed, as is nutrition, <br/>\nhealth, hygiene, smoking and drug education, and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory/Social Studies: Social Studies is very much in evidence in the <br/>\ngirl scout program. Girls learn about the history of GS, and women. <br/>\nThere are badges which address this subject as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhysical Education: There are badges at all levels that are geared <br/>\ntoward physical activities. Girls learn all about basic sports, but the <br/>\nGS program goes further, encouraging a great deal of physical <br/>\nactivities, including horseback riding, boating, camping, skiing, <br/>\nswimming, hiking, backpacking, no facilities camping (i.e., outdoor <br/>\ntoilets), etc. The girls are taught the skills they need in order to <br/>\ntake on very active roles in the camping experience, by doing the <br/>\nmajority of the cooking, cleaning, setting up of camp, and tearing down <br/>\nthe camp themselves. Although many leaders wait until the Junior level <br/>\nto camp, camping is vital to the GS program. Each girl is encouraged to <br/>\nlearn self defense including how to avoid dangerous situations and how <br/>\nto protect herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic: No GS program is complete without music. Campfire songs and fun <br/>\nsongs, songs to sing on car trips to various outings, and songs to sing <br/>\nwhen meetings are opening and closing, songs from different cultures, <br/>\nand songs from the past�GS meetings are not complete without the girls <br/>\nsinging at least a few songs!<br/>\n<br/>\nArts and Crafts: This is my favorite. As a GS leader, I can plan <br/>\nwonderful projects for the girls to do that I might not do in my own <br/>\nhome. We have painted, drawn with markers, crayons, pencils, and more. <br/>\nWe�ve weaved, sewn, tie dyed, painted t-shirt, made mobiles and <br/>\ncollages, gift baskets and ghosts out of tissue and lollypops. My girls <br/>\nhave made cards for all occasions, sock puppets, and made presents for <br/>\nservice projects (the nursing home and the homeless).<br/>\n<br/>\nService Projects: Service Projects are a vital part of the GS program. <br/>\nService projects help a girl to learn how she, as a single person or a <br/>\ngroup, can have an effect upon this world. My girls have done the <br/>\nfollowing projects: fed the homeless, performed at nursing homes and <br/>\nretirement communities, made tray decorations for Meals on Wheels, <br/>\ncollected food for a food bank, collected food, baby items, etc. for a <br/>\npregnant mom in need, adopted a family for Christmas (collected toys and <br/>\nfood and other items for a family in need), given gifts to various <br/>\ncommunity members at appropriate times (new baby, marriage, etc.), and <br/>\npicked up trash in a park. Service projects can be endless and should be <br/>\nstressed in the GS troop. The older the girls, the more intricate the <br/>\nprojects can be. Older girls can also be more involved in the planning <br/>\nprocess and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nResponsibility: In GS, girls learn responsibility: as they grow older <br/>\nthey take on increasingly difficult tasks in the management of the <br/>\ntroop, while the adults step back and become advisors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpiritual Training: Girl Scouts are not required to believe in God or a <br/>\nhigher power, as personal beliefs are not only respected but diversity <br/>\nis valued in the program. A girl can omit any part of the GS promise or <br/>\nlaw, as fits her personal belief system. The diverse environment helps <br/>\ngirls to see that there are many types of folks in this world and that <br/>\nlearning to get along with lots of different people and their <br/>\ndifferences is valuable. A girl promises to be a sister to every scout, <br/>\nregardless of race, religion, or any other category.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatriotism: The GS allows a girl, if it does not interfere with her <br/>\npersonal belief system, to learn to be a good citizen for her country. <br/>\nGirl Scouts is in almost every country in the world, and the GS <br/>\norganization wants each girl to support her own country and be a good <br/>\ncitizen for that country. Flag ceremonies, reciting the pledge and other <br/>\nforms of patriotism are encouraged but at no time is any girl forced to <br/>\nparticipate in anything that makes her uncomfortable or goes against her <br/>\nbeliefs. This is good for ALL girls, allowing them to see that people <br/>\ncan do things a bit differently and still be Girl Scouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe �S� Word�Social Skills: Girl Scouts is a great place for girls to be <br/>\nwith girls, to make friends, especially with girls whom otherwise they <br/>\nmight not get to meet. We do not allow, in our troop, cliques or <br/>\ngroups�each girl works with all the girls. The older girls help the <br/>\nyounger, and they all try to get along�despite differences. Our troop is <br/>\nvery supportive, with an environment where the girls are encouraging and <br/>\nloving to each other. The social skills learned in a good GS troop are <br/>\npositive and valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nField Trips: We have gone on a number of field trips, including Sea <br/>\nWorld, San Diego Wild Animal Park, the musicals Cats and Seussical, our <br/>\nyear end trip at the local water park, Palm Springs and tram, an apple <br/>\nfarm to pick apples, museums, the Discovery Science Center, and more. <br/>\nThe list is of possible field trips is endless.<br/>\n<br/>\nFUN! This is probably the most important part of the GS program. This is <br/>\na time for girls to come together and be with friends, to sing songs, to <br/>\nengage in arts & crafts, to complete a badge and to help our neighbors. <br/>\nAs seriously as I take the GS program, as part of our lives and part of <br/>\nour educational plan for our daughters, I never forget that fun is so <br/>\nimportant. We laugh and hug and really love to be with each other, and <br/>\nthat is what GS is all about!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; In a message dated 6/14/03 1:19:37 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;&lt; Sandra, I don&#39;t have a problem putting it up but can you wait for the<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; final draft, please? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I can put the final on there when you want.<br/>\n&gt; Since your post was dated Friday and you said &quot;tomorrow,&quot; I figured <br/>\n&gt; you were<br/>\n&gt; already gone to do the talk!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

I&#39;ll do so.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; do girls in scouts get to choose the badges they want to do <br/>\n&gt; individually or<br/>\n&gt; as a troop, or do the adults choose them?  what&#39;s a &quot;math badge&quot;?  do <br/>\n&gt; they<br/>\n&gt; have to do badges?  your music, arts & crafts, and service projects sound<br/>\n&gt; great. are those activities for badges or &quot;just for fun&quot;?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Both.  The older the girl the more they choose as a troop and <br/>\nindividually.  At the brownie level the girls are supposed to have a <br/>\nsay.  The idea is when the girls are young, the leaders help the girls <br/>\nstart to learn to manage the troop, the girls vote on projects, trips, <br/>\netc.  By the Caddette level, the girls are doing all most everything <br/>\nwith the adults only advisors.  At the high school level this is even <br/>\nmore so, the girls actually can sign the checkbook, with an adult <br/>\ncosigner, and manage all the funds.  The adults are clearly only advisors.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; i realize that the information you gave is the handout & not the talk, <br/>\n&gt; but<br/>\n&gt; i&#39;m not sure how similar the handout & talk are.  if i were just reading<br/>\n&gt; the handout, i&#39;d want an introductory paragraph about GS in general, and<br/>\n&gt; how my children could choose to participate, or if they can opt out of<br/>\n&gt; things that aren&#39;t interesting or meaningful to them.  i realize that<br/>\n&gt; you&#39;ve probably divided activities into school topics for the benefit of<br/>\n&gt; the audience, but i&#39;m not sure if GS uses the same categories or not.  <br/>\n&gt; the<br/>\n&gt; &quot;math badges&quot; were one thing that made me question how &#39;schooly&#39; girl<br/>\n&gt; scouts is.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Depends on the program.  Some troops are rather schooly, others are not. <br/>\n Mine is not, we do lots of fun things and sometimes &quot;educational&#39; <br/>\nactivities happen, well, lots of times, but I rarely point it out. <br/>\n Almost all my girls are in school, I have only 4 homeschooled girls in <br/>\nmy troop, including my own daughter (two other families).  <br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; thanks!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; michele<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; p.s. i&#39;ve sent some nitpicky comments (e.g. about missing punctuation)<br/>\n&gt; directly to you, but i thought other people might have this question too.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!

There is no such <br/>\nthing as an &quot;educational activity&quot; in the &quot;always learning&quot; philosophy. <br/>\nAm I correct?

I am currently a leader in a multi level <br/>\ntroop (Brownies and Juniors) with three other leaders. We unschooling <br/>\nour two daughters, ages 4 and 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nAugmentation of a Homeschooling Program through Girl Scouts<br/>\n<br/>\nReading: Girls must read in order to complete badges, but the reading <br/>\ncan go so much further. My girls have had to read to memorize various <br/>\nitems, including songs, the promise and law, and their parts in <br/>\ndifferent plays. We also read the story of Girl Scouts, and Juliet Low, <br/>\nthe Founder. The girls are also required to read the rules for product <br/>\nsales, and of course, the incentives they can earn by selling the <br/>\nproducts. Girls must decide how to spend the money earned by the product <br/>\nsales, and in doing so often do research. The older the GS the more <br/>\nreading is necessary. We learn to read best by reading those things that <br/>\nare important to us, and those things for which we can see practical <br/>\nvalue. Girls usually enjoy scouts and therefore the reading is valuable <br/>\nto them. In some cases, the reading might be a bit above their comfort <br/>\nlevel, but because they are motivated to read, reading happens, and <br/>\nskills develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nWriting: There are constant opportunities for writing. The girls in my <br/>\ntroop have written the following: thank you notes, posters for product <br/>\nsales, invitations to various ceremonies, letters for many occasions <br/>\n(including one to the President), and more. As the girls get older, GS <br/>\nencourages the girls to write notes to people who have purchased <br/>\ncookies. Again, as with reading, the writing within GS is usually <br/>\nmeaningful, practical and useful<br/>\n<br/>\nMath: The math opportunities are endless. Product sales provide lots of <br/>\nopportunities for math\u0014both in handling money and figuring out how many <br/>\nmore boxes of cookies you need to sell in order to reach your personal <br/>\ngoal. Dues are also vital and the youngest of scouts can be responsible <br/>\nfor paying their own dues. As the girls get older, they take an active <br/>\nrole in troop finances. They decide how to spend the money, and budget <br/>\nthe various trips, activities, and service projects as a troop. At the <br/>\nSenior level, they actually take over the troop checking account, along <br/>\nwith their adult advisor. There are math badges at all levels, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nScience: There are many science badges, at all levels. The founder of <br/>\ngirl scouts and the current folks who write GS badges must realize how <br/>\nimportant science (and math) is (are) to girls. Girl Scouts also <br/>\nprovides a wonderful setting (all girls, nothing but girls) for the <br/>\nlearning of science (and math). Ecology and the natural environment is <br/>\nstressed, as is nutrition, health, hygiene, smoking and drug education, <br/>\nand more. The health sciences are covered as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHistory/Social Studies: Social Studies is very much in evident in the <br/>\ngirl scout program. Girls learn about the history of girl scouts, and <br/>\nwomen. There are badges which address this subject as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhysical Education: There are badges at all levels that are geared <br/>\ntoward physical activities. Girls learn all about basic sports, but the <br/>\nGS program goes further, encouraging a great deal of physical <br/>\nactivities, including horseback riding, boating, camping, skiing, <br/>\nswimming, hiking, backpacking, no facilities camping (ie, out door <br/>\ntoilets), etc. The girls are taught the skills they need in order to <br/>\ntake on very active roles in the camping experience, doing the majority <br/>\nof the cooking, cleaning, setting up of camp, and tearing down <br/>\nthemselves. Camping is vital to the GS program, although many leaders <br/>\nwait until the Junior level to camp. Each girl is encouraged to learn <br/>\nself defense including how to avoid dangerous situation and how to <br/>\nprotect themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMusic: No GS program is complete without music. Campfire songs and fun <br/>\nsongs, songs to sing on car trips to various outings, and songs to sing <br/>\nwhen meetings are opening and meetings are closing, songs from different <br/>\ncultures, and songs from the past\u0014GS meetings are not complete without <br/>\nthe girls singing at least a few songs!<br/>\n<br/>\nArts and Crafts: This is my favorite. As a GS leader, I can plan <br/>\nwonderful projects for the girls to do that I might not do in my own <br/>\nhome. We have painted, drawn with markers, crayons, pencils, and more. <br/>\nWe\u0019ve weaved, sewn, tie dyed, t-shirt painting, made mobiles and <br/>\ncollages, gift baskets and ghosts out of tissue and lollypops. My girls <br/>\nhave made cards for all occasions, sock puppets, and made presents for <br/>\nservice projects (the nursing home and the homeless).<br/>\n<br/>\nService Projects: Service Projects are a vital part of the GS program. <br/>\nService projects help girls to learn how they, as a single person or a <br/>\ngroup of girls, can have an effect upon this world. My girls have done <br/>\nthe following projects: feeding the homeless, giving cookies from our <br/>\ntroop to the homeless, performed at nursing homes and retirement <br/>\ncommunities, made tray decorations for Meals on Wheels, collected food <br/>\nfor a food bank, collected food, baby items, etc. for a pregnant mom in <br/>\nneed, collected toys and food and other items for a family in need <br/>\n(adopted that family for Christmas), given gifts to various community <br/>\nmembers at appropriate times (new baby, marriage, etc.), picked up trash <br/>\nin a park, etc. Service projects can be endless, and should be something <br/>\nthat is stressed in the GS troop. The older the girls, the more <br/>\nintricate the projects can be. Older girls can also be more involved in <br/>\nthe planning process and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nResponsibility: GS teaches girls to be responsible, because as the girls <br/>\ngrow older, the take on every increasingly difficult tasks in the <br/>\nmanagement of the troop, with the adults being trained to step back and <br/>\nbecome advisors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpiritual Training: Girl Scouts are not required to believe in God or a <br/>\nhigher power, as personal beliefs are not only respected but diversity <br/>\nis valued in the program. Girls can omit any part of the GS promise or <br/>\nlaw, as fits their personal belief system. The diverse environment helps <br/>\ngirls to see that there are many types of folks in this world, and that <br/>\nlearning to get along with lots of different people and their <br/>\ndifferences, is valuable. Girls promise to be a sister to every scout, <br/>\nregardless of race, religion, or any other category.<br/>\n<br/>\nPatriotism: The GS allows girls, if it does not interfere with her <br/>\npersonal belief system, to learn to be a good citizen for her country. <br/>\nGirl Scouts is in almost all Countries in the world, and the GS <br/>\norganization wants each girl to support her own country, and be a good <br/>\ncitizen for that country. Flag ceremonies, saying of the pledge and <br/>\nother forms of patriotism are encouraged but at not time is any girl <br/>\nforced to participate in anything that makes her uncomfortably or goes <br/>\nagainst her beliefs. This is good for ALL girls, allowing them to see <br/>\nthat people can do things a bit differently and still be Girl Scouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \u001cS\u001d word\u0014Social Skills: Girl Scouts is a great place for girls to be <br/>\nwith girls, to make friends, especially with friends who otherwise they <br/>\nmight not get to meet. We do not allow, in our troop, cliques or <br/>\ngroups\u0014all the girls work with all the girls. The younger are helped by <br/>\nthe older, good friends can sometimes work with each other and at other <br/>\ntimes, the girls know they need to learn to get along with and work with <br/>\npeople who are not their best friend. Our troop is a very supportive <br/>\none, with an environment where the girls are encouraging and loving to <br/>\neach other. The social skills learned in a good GS troop are positive <br/>\nand valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFUN! This is probably the most important part of the GS program. This is <br/>\na time for girls to come together and be with friends, to sing songs, to <br/>\npaint or draw, to complete badges and help our neighbors. As serious as <br/>\nI take the GS program, as part of our lives and part of our educational <br/>\nplan for our daughters, I never forget that fun is so important. We <br/>\nlaugh and hug and really love to be with each other, and that is what GS <br/>\nis all about!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15109,"nextTopicId":15125}}
