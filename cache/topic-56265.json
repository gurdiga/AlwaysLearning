My dh has two part (near full) time jobs, and I work two part time jobs that amount to about 20 hours including often both days of the weekends.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has had to make a big adjustment. One of the things that has truly helped her is that we are sharing our reasons - ie the need for money - and broken down our spending so that she can see where the money goes. We aren&#39;t denying her treats or outings so that we adults can buy bon bons and beer - that&#39;s for sure! <br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be hard to support her desire for stuff. Sometimes it would be so much easier for me deal with if she just stopped wanting and asking. But it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be easier for her to have to repress her desires and dreams of bounty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other is to be really understanding and patient during what are her transition times from being with daddy all day to seeing me when I come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever what I really want to talk about is something that you will most likely consider to be really knit picky. It&#39;s in your words, which reflect your thinking - as is the case for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s this:<br/>\n<br/>\n===I feel I would do my children a disservice not to require some sort of responsibility to the family. ====<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not a feeling. You don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; this. You believe this. This is a statement of a belief or an opinion. Maybe it isn&#39;t even your true belief, but something you have heard from other sources.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe feeling is something underlying the belief. I&#39;m going to guess the feeling is Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nFear that they won&#39;t learn about responsibility unless you require it.<br/>\nFear that your kids will grow up lazy and financially desperate.<br/>\nFear that you and your dh will fail your children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people make similar statements when the real feeling is Resentment (that they have to do all the work, and they had chores as a child, and when will it be &quot;my turn&quot;?!?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes people make similar statements when the real feeling is Fear of other people&#39;s opinion - the desire to look good in their community or church or extended family.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes just making broad statements as if they were feelings allows us to avoid examining the painful feelings themselves. Fear is a tough feeling to face squarely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are having money troubles as my family is, Fear is hovering around like these darn fruit flies that won&#39;t seem to leave my kitchen. I can try to ignore them, but every now and then they swarm up again when I open a cupboard or move a dish. It&#39;s better to face Fear and acknowledge it. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers, the many who have gone before, have found that so many conventional parents&#39; usual fears are groundless or far smaller than imagined.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the next step, having understood the feeling, is to examine the need. Instead of making your need &quot;instill responsibility&quot;, maybe it&#39;s &quot;get certain tasks done&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nI told Jayn I needed more help because I wasn&#39;t accomplishing much of my immense to do list. I was feeling overwhelmed, and actually a bit tearful. I asked her to try to do just a few more things for herself, like get her own iced water. She was resistant - explaining that she&#39;s bothered by the fruit flies in the kitchen! The real ones, not the metaphorical fear ones. I understand her fear around them &#39;though.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut - the next day I came out and she had voluntarily cleared all the toys and WIP&#39;s off the sofa. (That&#39;s Works In Progress, btw.) Just like when she was little - she still prefers to do a task that is for someone else than something that is self care.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

We JUST found out <br/>\nabout some relatives coming who are expecting to stay with us. We have <br/>\nan extra room, but it has been used as a storage room for a couple of <br/>\nyears - piled very high with boxes and all kinds of stuff. We also have <br/>\na loft/attic kind of place that is great for storage, but it was a big <br/>\nmess and very full.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Monday, Rosie asked me how we were going to get that back room <br/>\ncleaned up for the relatives. I said I thought I&#39;d have to get a storage <br/>\nunit and move all the boxes there. She said she&#39;d help me on Wednesday. <br/>\nThis morning, she said, &quot;I think if Roxana and I go up in the loft, we <br/>\ncan rearrange stuff and also there is a lot of stuff in there we could <br/>\ndonate to Goodwill. So they did - they spent several hours up there and <br/>\nthe back of my car is filled with goodwill donations. THEN, in the <br/>\nafternoon, she asked her boyfriend to come over and help move all the <br/>\nboxes from the extra room into the loft. That took another hour or so <br/>\nand was very hard work - most of the boxes are full of books.  Rosie is <br/>\n19, Rox is 22, and Daniel (the boyfriend) is 24.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust when they finished moving the boxes to the loft, Cyrus came home <br/>\nfrom work. We all sat around on the patio for a bit and they asked Cyrus <br/>\nand me if we wanted to go to a movie with them. We declined for various <br/>\nreasons and they were leaving to go to the movie and Rosie said, &quot;We&#39;ll <br/>\nbe back right after the movie - not going out to eat or anything tonight <br/>\nbecause we have a lot to do tomorrow and don&#39;t want to be out too late.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nALL this from kids who never had an assigned chore. Today was kind of <br/>\namazing even to me - they worked most of the day completely and totally <br/>\nof their own volition. They don&#39;t always do that. There are times they <br/>\nsit and watch tv for hours while I work around the house and I sometimes <br/>\nwonder why they don&#39;t get up and help. I sometimes have to talk myself <br/>\nout of being resentful about it and it helps to remind myself that they <br/>\ndo not even know I&#39;m resenting it - they don&#39;t have the same issues <br/>\nabout housework that I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works best around here seems to be to ask very directly for very <br/>\nspecific kinds of help - &quot;Can you take those dishes to the kitchen and <br/>\nrinshe them off, when you get a chance?&quot;  &quot;Do you have time to unload <br/>\nthe dishwasher this morning?&quot;  I made it my policy, over the years, to <br/>\nnot ask much and to only ask once - not to nag. If they don&#39;t get to it, <br/>\nthey don&#39;t. Not a big deal. I&#39;d just do it when I had a chance.  I also <br/>\nsometimes make myself to-do lists and say, &quot;If you have time to help me <br/>\nout today, I have my to-do list on the table.&quot; They&#39;ll almost always <br/>\npick something off the list and do it and cross it off. Sometimes <br/>\nthey&#39;ll just start going through the list and do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in the days when I used to make them do housework, everybody did it <br/>\nwith great resentment and anger.  They did the minimum they felt they <br/>\ncould do, they banged things around, did a lousy job, glowering and <br/>\nunhappy and snapping at each other and at me. I tried to make it more <br/>\nfun. I tried to pay. I tried reasoning with them. I tried all kinds of <br/>\nthings. What worked was to stop all of it. I&#39;d done damage, so I stopped <br/>\nfor YEARS. And they slowly became helpful until, in their mid to late <br/>\nteens, they became super helpful and we no longer ever ever have any <br/>\nhard feelings about housework and I don&#39;t go around feeling like a <br/>\nmartyr - I do what &quot;I&quot; want done and I slowly began to ask, gently and <br/>\nvery open-endedly for help and I get a lot of it. Best part is I get <br/>\nhelp that is cheerful. Today Rosie and Roxana talked and laughed for <br/>\nhours while choosing to do hard housework.

Probably not. Probably you&#39;d resent it to some extent. That&#39;s a normal human reaction and children aren&#39;t exempt from it. &quot;Taking responsibility&quot; or behaving responsibly isn&#39;t something children need to be taught to do. Its natural for people to be good to those they love, to do things for them, to take on some responsibilites out of empathy and personal desire. Requiring responsbilities gets in the way of that. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; As they grow won&#39;t they see that they live in a world in which will require them <br/>\n&gt; to help others whether they feel like it or not. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Nope, not a bit of it. No-one in the world is required to help anyone else - and some people aren&#39;t terribly helpful or responsible, even though they were &quot;taught&quot; to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t see responsibility as something you choose, if you see it as a burden you&#39;re stuck with, then it will help your kids if you can find a way to shift your perspective. It will help them see responsibility as something *they* get to choose - Get to choose! That&#39;s a marvelous gift, that of being able to choose to be thoughtful and helpful and gracious. You would do them a greater service to give them that gift, rather than a stack of burdens. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Is it not necessary to learn to act as a part of the whole.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you think of yourself as simply a part of a whole, rather than yourself with needs and wishes and dreams? I&#39;m guessing not, but you&#39;re asking your children to be parts - cogs in the family machine. That&#39;s hard. They don&#39;t want to be parts, they want to be human beings, and learning is very important to human beings, its one of the things that drives and motivates people. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf its more important that they be parts of a whole than people who are motivated by their own love of learning, put them in school! Schools are designed on an assembly line model - your kids will have ample opportunity to be parts of a great big whole there.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: breathless","postDate":"1279739902","msgId":56318,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwNjM5NS40MTkxOC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDMubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQxNjk0LjQ0MDMwLnFtQHdlYjEyMDAxNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGkyNWVlMCs3c2kyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDE2OTQuNDQwMzAucW1Ad2ViMTIwMDE0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":56317,"nextInTopic":56323,"prevInTime":56317,"nextInTime":56319,"topicId":56265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***Is it not necessary to learn to act as a part of the whole.*** Children do grow up learning to act as part of a whole when they have a great team leader.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-944785541\">***Is it not necessary to learn to act as a part of the whole.***<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren do grow up learning to act as part of a whole when they have a great <br/>\nteam leader.

Is this something that we <br/>\nwait upon also?***<br/>\n<br/>\nIt IS a world in which anybody can or not help anyone else.  We all get a choice <br/>\nin that.  I do NOT have to help any other person in the whole wide world.  I <br/>\ncould simply focus on my own needs only.  I can make that choice.  So can each <br/>\nand every person that exists on the planet.  I choose to help others in large <br/>\nand small ways, my kids first.  By so doing, my kids learn how to help others. <br/>\n They get that choice too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a month ago or so, my oldest, 16 got into an argument with the father of <br/>\nher boyfriend.  He was being an ass to his son while Chamille was there <br/>\nvisiting, she spoke up on his behalf.  He dismissed her by saying that she <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about because she doesn&#39;t have any <br/>\nresponsibilities because she doesn&#39;t go to school and we don&#39;t &quot;discipline&quot; our <br/>\nchildren or have &quot;rules&quot;.  That was the first time anyone had ever told her <br/>\nsomething like that and she absolutely disagreed with that.  She told him that <br/>\nshe DOES have responsibilities, that everyone does.  That argument didn&#39;t end <br/>\nwell.  He insisted she leave because he decided at that moment to ground his son <br/>\nfor the evening.  He told her that he&#39;d give her a ride home and she told him <br/>\nthat she&#39;d rather take the bus and walked out the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that moment, she was being very responsible for her own sanity and health. <br/>\n She clearly saw that he wasn&#39;t being a very responsible host or a very <br/>\nresponsible dad.  That being an ass doesn&#39;t get to qualify as being responsible, <br/>\nno matter how one might phrase it.  She came home and we talked about all the <br/>\nways in which a person can and is responsible.  She&#39;s very responsible, she gets <br/>\nhome on time, she always lets us know where she is, she doesn&#39;t lie or steal, <br/>\nshe saves money when she can, she doesn&#39;t smoke or drink or do drugs.  She keeps <br/>\nher room as tidy as possible, she&#39;ll watch her little sister almost any time we <br/>\nask, she&#39;s sweet to her too, she makes people food when they are hungry and <br/>\nattends to her guests when they are here.  That was just scratching the surface <br/>\non how a person can be responsible.  Being responsible does NOT mean doing <br/>\nhousehold work or doing what the parents say to do.  It can mean those things, <br/>\nbut it doesn&#39;t equal those things.  If you look for responsibility by seeing it <br/>\nin your children doing what they are asked to do, when you ask them to, you are <br/>\nonly going to get compliance or resistance or a combination of both.  Doing the <br/>\ndishes does not make a person responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n ***When my children were younger, as yours are, it was quite simple (in <br/>\nretrospect) to carry the load, but now it is quite overwhelming. Plus the sheer <br/>\nnumber of people within the home makes it crazy. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that hard to believe actually.  Little kids come with LOTS of clean up, <br/>\ndiapers, barf, mud, food, spills, stains, toys everywhere, etc.  Older kids are <br/>\nmuch better at containing these things.  They don&#39;t make as many spills, nor do <br/>\nthey poop in diapers, and generally don&#39;t track mud throughout the house or <br/>\nleave spills in the middle of the kitchen floor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you are seeing is through a lens of resentment.  Be more objective about <br/>\nit.  Your kids are bigger and louder and take up more space.  Their stuff is <br/>\nbigger and louder and takes up more space.  Less space makes things look less <br/>\ntidy.  More kids equals more stuff, more activity, more toys out and about.  You <br/>\ncan choose to see it as a big load of mess and lack of help around the house, or <br/>\nyou could see all the business of life surrounding you in a big active house of <br/>\npeople, doing their things and learning and living.  When it comes right down to <br/>\nit, what are the very basics of keeping up with house cleaning?  Kitchen work, <br/>\nlaundry, floors, spaces to sit, spaces to eat, and spaces to do projects, <br/>\nbathroom, and yard work.  That about sums it up, taking into account individual <br/>\npreferences.  If you break it down into those things, you&#39;ll see the everyday <br/>\nstuff and the once a week stuff.  The everyday stuff might be kitchen stuff, and <br/>\nspaces to eat and spaces to sit.  Everything else is once a week or less stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] breathless","postDate":"1279734034","msgId":56316,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrRVZMdVZfVlUwdmEyVEtoSmVES0NmRV8xaW5WOVhoZnF5N0ZWQkBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDM1OTUzNS45MjAyNy5xbUB3ZWIxMjAwMDYubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGkyNGpvdSs5NW1uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgk8QUFOTGtUaW1aX19nSHI3OEV4RVFYd0xXUmpaR3R4LXItUkh0SXRLRmt6WVZJQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8MzU5NTM1LjkyMDI3LnFtQHdlYjEyMDAwNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":56315,"nextInTopic":56317,"prevInTime":56315,"nextInTime":56317,"topicId":56265,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Yes I m glad you had some snuggle time with that boy of yours.

Plus the sheer number of people within the home<br/>\nmakes it crazy.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something on Sandra&#39;s website that wasn&#39;t written in response<br/>\nto your question above but applies to an angle of the question that<br/>\nseems to be a focus but -----just----- misses. -How a parent can<br/>\npartner with children to provide what they need for learning what they<br/>\nwant to know about and to help them in forming a set of values about<br/>\ncleaning that is their own yet is very likely to borrow much from the<br/>\nparent:<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/chores/relationship\">http://sandradodd.com/chores/relationship</a><br/>\n***how do you get your kids to clean***<br/>\n<br/>\nHow could your husband get you to scrub the garage floor?<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could yell or threaten or bribe or beg. But what kind of<br/>\nrelationship would that create between you?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if your child had a tower of collectible soda cans that was<br/>\nalways falling over. What if he decided that since you&#39;re part of the<br/>\nfamily that restacking them once a week was part of your job. How<br/>\ncould he get you to do that? And how could he get you to stack them in<br/>\nthe &quot;proper&quot; (e.g. his) order? And what if you didn&#39;t do it to his<br/>\nstandards and didn&#39;t do as good a job as he knew you were capable of?<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what if he said once a week &quot;Mom, would you mind keeping me<br/>\ncompany while I stack these cans? Maybe we could listen to a book on<br/>\ntape together. Or you could tell me about the project your working<br/>\non.&quot; Sometimes you might not be able to join him because you were in<br/>\nthe middle of something. Sometimes you might help him stack just<br/>\nbecause it feels good to help him out. And if he was truly thankful in<br/>\na way that let you know that he knew there were more interesting<br/>\nthings you could be doing, you&#39;d be more likely to help him. On the<br/>\nother hand if he criticized your stacking, or came to expect you to<br/>\nhelp him you&#39;d be less likely to help and might even be less likely to<br/>\nspend time with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how can you get your kids to clean?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could make them. And take withdrawals from your relationship<br/>\naccount with them to pay for it. They might be angry with you but<br/>\nyou&#39;d have a clean house.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if your relationship with them is important, you can shift your<br/>\nthinking and see the house and all the tasks as belonging to you. And<br/>\nthen invite them to help. And acknowledge that you appreciate their<br/>\nhelp -- no matter how small -- knowing that they could be playing a<br/>\nvideo game or watching a favorite show instead and they&#39;ve chosen to<br/>\nbe with you.<br/>\n****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole page is a very good read on chores too as are the other<br/>\nlinks in this thread. If you don&#39;t have time to read anything else, I<br/>\nespecially like the words &quot;acknowledge that you appreciate their help<br/>\n-- no matter how small -- know they could be playing ... and they&#39;ve<br/>\nchosen to be with you.&quot; That&#39;s gold in the relationship bank!<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Jul 21, 2010 at 10:05 AM, R Boulier &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boulier72@...\">boulier72@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Maybe this will help frame the picture for you.

So from the child&#39;s viewpoint, that&#39;s 2<br/>\n&gt; negatives too many already working against his version of why he<br/>\n&gt; should help. Explaining it to him may just sound like excuses.<br/>\n&gt; Offering opportunities to help and accepting &quot;no&quot; and thanking (not<br/>\n&gt; praising) him will most likely convince the child that his<br/>\n&gt; contribution is even a fun part of doing what he most likely wants to<br/>\n&gt; do anyway... at least sometimes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Eight is still such a baby in my eyes.

As soon as things are requirements, people want out of the<br/>\n&gt; deal if they can&#39;t see the benefit to themselves or really even to<br/>\n&gt; others. I have often felt that people want stuff just to see you do<br/>\n&gt; stuff (that&#39;s a school conditioned jump-through-hoops tape of my own)<br/>\n&gt; and to test your commitment to them by getting you to jump ... and<br/>\n&gt; then do it consistently too!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Especially for a young child who has little notion of what you&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; doing when you&#39;re at work all day, it can seem that you&#39;re doing<br/>\n&gt; nothing and are just not home. So from the child&#39;s viewpoint, that&#39;s 2<br/>\n&gt; negatives too many already working against his version of why he<br/>\n&gt; should help. Explaining it to him may just sound like excuses.<br/>\n&gt; Offering opportunities to help and accepting &quot;no&quot; and thanking (not<br/>\n&gt; praising) him will most likely convince the child that his<br/>\n&gt; contribution is even a fun part of doing what he most likely wants to<br/>\n&gt; do anyway... at least sometimes.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Eight is still such a baby in my eyes. Probably such a young child<br/>\n&gt; still just wants his mommy. Hopefully he&#39;s getting loads of affection<br/>\n&gt; in this time of transition (and if it were me, that would go both ways<br/>\n&gt; and help me to express the love I feel and to transition too).<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ~Katherine<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Tue, Jul 20, 2010 at 12:44 PM, pranamama72 &lt;boulier72@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; &gt; May I begin by a brief intro. and greeting.

I feel my time with them is <br/>\n&gt;so limited now that I want the few hours I do have to be full of greatness, but <br/>\n&gt;more times than not it is frustruating and discouraging. Some of my kids (mostly <br/>\n&gt;my youngest and only son) resist any attempts at structure in regards to mutual <br/>\n&gt;responsiblity within the home.

Am I spoiling him if I <br/>\n&gt;just leave him alone? I try to explain the importance of everyone pulling their <br/>\n&gt;own weight so we are all happy and the home runs smoothly. The difficult part is <br/>\n&gt;that as much as I want to allow them to have their own say and freedom we are <br/>\n&gt;also a large family and have to function as a whole also. How do we live <br/>\n&gt;together as a group while respecting individuality? What signs do I look for to <br/>\n&gt;show me if I have already done some damage? I try as i might to say yes to as <br/>\n&gt;much as humanly and financially possible...which is very limited, but I feel I <br/>\n&gt;am limiting them in turn. I just have such difficulty with feelings of guilt for <br/>\n&gt;the life we have created for them and my own limitaions.
