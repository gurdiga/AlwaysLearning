If a child is ready and<br/>\nable to act on your suggestions, they won&#39;t need explanations, just a quick<br/>\nsuggestion and they don&#39;t need you to repeat it. If they aren&#39;t ready and<br/>\nable to act on your suggestions, all the explaining and justifying in the<br/>\nworld won&#39;t make them ready or willing. And it is truly counterproductive<br/>\nto repeat oneself as it sort of &quot;trains&quot; the child to stop listening. If<br/>\nyou&#39;ve told them once and it wasn&#39;t helpful, it isn&#39;t likely to be helpful<br/>\nthe next time or the next. Wait some time, until the child has grown up<br/>\nsome, before offering the same suggestion again.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids really value my suggestions. I&#39;m amazed at how much! They are 20,<br/>\n24, and 26 and they ask for my input a lot - almost daily. They even will<br/>\ncall and tell me how they did respond to something and ask for my<br/>\n&quot;analysis&quot; - they want to know if they could have done something<br/>\ndifferent/better/more/less/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, looking back, how this happened. It is because I was very careful<br/>\nabout offering advice. I would offer just a little tidbit - often just a<br/>\nword or two, to indicate that, indeed, I did HAVE some advice to offer. But<br/>\nI didn&#39;t just give it, wanted or not. As they got older, I flat out asked,<br/>\n&quot;Do you want ideas?&quot; And they fairly often would say, &quot;Not now.&quot; And I<br/>\nwould really truly and outwardly calmly - refrain. This was not easy for<br/>\nme. It got easier over the years. And, they more and more often wanted my<br/>\ninput, over the years.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn&#39;t to say that I sat around, helpless, while my kid behaved badly.<br/>\nI protected her from further embarrassment (because she was, in fact,<br/>\nembarrassed by her own out-of-controlness) by removing her from being<br/>\naround other people. If she was screaming mean things at someone, I didn&#39;t<br/>\njust pretend that it was all fine and dandy and acceptable behavior. I took<br/>\nit seriously and behaved appropriately, myself. My daughter didn&#39;t hit or<br/>\nkick or do anything physical - it was all words. So I got her out of<br/>\nearshot as fast as possible. Often, if she could get away from people for a<br/>\nwhile, she could calm herself. If she couldn&#39;t recover her composure in a<br/>\nreasonable time, I&#39;d take her home.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was aware of situations that would overwhelm her. I kept her out of them<br/>\nif possible. I knew that too many hours in a group of other kids would wear<br/>\nher out, emotionally, while my other kids were still having a great time.<br/>\nSo I&#39;d take her with me to run an errand while another mom watched my other<br/>\nkids. I&#39;d ask her to go for a walk with me - take her out of the park-day<br/>\ngroup for a few minutes. I&#39;d give her breaks, sometimes just go take her a<br/>\nbottle of water or a snack to give her a reason to step away from the group<br/>\nfor a couple of minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore explosive kids are a challenge to our parenting skills, for sure. But<br/>\nI learned SO much about human nature and my own self and I wouldn&#39;t trade<br/>\nthose years for anything. My used-to-be-explosive kid is an intense and<br/>\npassionate, but also thoughtful and clear-headed, 24-year-old. She&#39;s<br/>\ndelightful. People love her. She has lots of friends. She&#39;s very involved<br/>\nin leadership in a lot of different activities and she is now the one<br/>\nothers turn to for solution-oriented problem solving because she is good at<br/>\nit. I am amazed when she tells me about how she&#39;s working with other people<br/>\nin various groups to resolve conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Wed, Nov 16, 2011 at 5:05 AM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; **<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I have been talking to her after because she goes from quiet to<br/>\n&gt; screaming or crying really loudly in a flash.

Too much after the fact talk is not likely to help her when she needs it the most. It&#39;s possible she doesn&#39;t even remember what you&#39;ve told her, especially if it&#39;s wrapped up in long talks and your own expectations of what she should do when she gets upset. Instead of making suggestions and expecting her to remember the ideas you&#39;ve given her when she&#39;s calm, drop a hint at the moment she needs it, and like Sandra said, WITHOUT it being an exchange, or a lecture.    <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am not sure what is at work here for her as I tend towards getting unusually calm in times of stress.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This reminded me of something my oldest daughter, who is 9, just recently clued in on that I do that she does not like.  When we have guests or friends over, I have recently tended to get even more calm when I speak with her regarding something that is being disruptive to the guests, for instance cranking up the music to uncomfortable levels.  This happened several times over the weekend. At some point, I noticed my voice getting lower and slower than normal. She said, &quot;I hate when you talk to me like that.&quot; Clearly I was not being helpful.  In fact, after I noticed how I sounded, I was appalled at how gross it came across.  The next time it occurred, I made a point to say in my normal tone of voice and without any eye contact, &quot;That hurts people&#39;s ears,&quot; and she turned it down right away.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve suggested to my husband to consider...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve suggested that my husband needs to consider...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I was able to speak with her calmly about what was happening for her...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I explained that...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I mentioned ...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I felt that...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I have been able to discuss with her...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve asked her to consider...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I have made suggestions to my daughter...&quot;<br/>\n&quot;I have also told her that...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAll those were from two posts.

What did you do to help them?=-=<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I came to understand that expressing frustration (sometimes loudly!) was part of how Seth dealt with learning hard things. Early on, I thought that something was *wrong*, because he seemed so distressed! He *was* so distressed! But, once I stopped trying to get him to respond the way I thought he *should*, and I made peace with HOW he was responding, I was much calmer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a quiet, peaceful person, and I heard his &quot;I HATE this game!! I NEVER want to play it again!&quot; as something that needed to be fixed. It didn&#39;t! He would yell, get it out of his system, and buckle down to play again. I tried offering to look up player&#39;s guides, videos, etc. but he would get really annoyed by my offering! So I learned to sit with him, and let him be how he needed to be to process things, and STOP offering solutions - until he was calm, at least. I might murmur things like, &quot;That sounds really hard!&quot;, and he was amenable to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was good practice for me to not be knocked off my center - I would sit and breathe, and find calm within myself, so I could be calm for him. At 12 (13 soon) he rarely yells like that any more - I can&#39;t remember the last time. He uses the tools I helped him find - breathing deeply, closing his eyes for a moment. He grew into using those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t say he &quot;didn&#39;t like&quot; the early process. It was hard, but the value of learning was enough for him to stick with it, despite his frustration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hey - in response to the Tiger Mom post - I never had to FORCE him to stick with it! It was of his choosing, even though it was difficult. This is exactly the point people are making - unschoolers DO choose to do hard things, without being forced or reminded or coerced. Let your soon keep choosing to do hard things!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got to a point with Seth that I heard his frustration as evidence of a strong, determined person, and I made peace with it.

My son is 8, and has been taking lessons for a couple of years.  I will give some background:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband loves music.  He plays guitar and piano and likes to drum.  Since Ethan was little they have been playing music and singing favourite songs together.  Ethan loves it.  We got our piano a few years ago, second hand, and from day one Ethan was intrigued by it. He started finding songs on the keys - the theme song to World of Goo, the Linus song from Charley Brown, and a few others I can&#39;t remember any longer. <br/>\n<br/>\nI talked about me taking lessons.  I have never played an instrument, and I have always wanted to learn to play the piano.  Ethan piped up and said, &quot;I want to take lessons.&quot;  We went and sat in on a lesson.  Ethan loved it, and loved the teacher.  We decided to take the lesson together.  Every week I practice, and this helps him hear the music.  He plays best by ear.  I seem to do better reading music.  That part has worked out well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe part that isn&#39;t working, in my opinion, is how hard Ethan is on himself at the start of every new piece.  He wants to get it to the point that he likes right away, and it so frustrated by the slow process of learning in the beginning, to the point where he dreads the beginning.  He cries, and claims he will never get it, although he always does.  He does this with video games too.  He has a hard time with early challenges, and wants to get things right off the bat.  He doesn&#39;t want to quit, but he doesn&#39;t like the early process.  I try to stay calm, give him suggestions like take deep breaths, take breaks, slow down, try smaller chunks of the music.  He doesn&#39;t want these kinds of suggestions.  He just wants to get it, and he does, but the getting there is really hard for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have suggested a couple times that we take a break from the lessons.  I don&#39;t feel like it is going to increase his love of music or help our relationship with this kind of continued stress every week.  We have talked to the teacher about it, and she has been very supportive.  She is young, and understands and embraces how we learn.  She is really great with Ethan in class.  She takes tangents and loves the way he approaches his learning on the piano.  Ethan likes to compose pieces or change pieces, and she loves this.  One lesson they found all of the scales by ear, because Ethan wanted to.  She closed the books, leaving her lesson plans.  She was so excited by what he was doing.  She lets go of technique in favour of his learning style.  We feel really fortunate to have met her.  I don&#39;t think it would have lasted this long without her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, *I* still want to stop the lessons for now.  And, Ethan does not.  He really doesn&#39;t.  He gets upset when I suggest it.  I don&#39;t know what to do.  I don&#39;t want to stop, myself, because he likes us doing this together.  I think he would feel like I was walking away from him, or giving up on him.  I don&#39;t want to do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have experience with their kids having a really hard time with new challenges of their choosing?  What did you do to help them?  Like I said, we see this in new video games, new levels in games he knows, new songs, wanting to draw a character just like the character, and many other places too.  He is really hard on himself when he doesn&#39;t get things to go the way he wants them to on the first try.  Always has been.  He used to get so frustrated by the marbles not going down the tracks the way he had planned, or trains not meeting up on the tracks the way he had envisioned.  He would stomp and cry out loudly.  He seemed just devastated.  Then, when he does get whatever it is, he is thrilled.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve watched &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot; a few times, and talked about celebrating mistakes.  We&#39;ve read about mistakes that have become inventions.  We&#39;ve talked about Thomas Edison inventing 1000 or so lightbulbs before he made the one that finally worked.  He loves these stories, but can&#39;t seem to apply this idea to his own mistakes.  He is really kind and encouraging when I make mistakes, but really hard on himself.  That is so hard for me.  I wish he would be this kind to himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions or questions welcome!  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63798,"nextTopicId":63836}}
