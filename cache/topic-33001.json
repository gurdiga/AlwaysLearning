She was perfectly fine with it all, even though she has slept in<br/>\nour room (on and off, usually in her own bed) since she was 6 months old.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my youngest, Lilly, who is 4 years old (turned 4 in November) is<br/>\nhaving a really hard time without her sister. Her and her sister have slept<br/>\ntogether in the same queen sized bed for about 2-2 1/2 years. I doubt Lil<br/>\neven remembers when she DIDN&#39;T sleep with Marti.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if I could get some ideas from you about how I can make Lil<br/>\nmore comfortable. Lil is still in our room, still in the queen bed which is<br/>\npushed right up next to mine and her &quot;spot&quot; is right next to mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if it would help to mention that we have a tentative &quot;bedtime&quot;<br/>\nand bedtime routine only because Lil chooses it to be that way. Lil is a<br/>\nmorning person (like me) and gets up early. She usually mentions getting<br/>\ntired around 8-9pm and that is when we go upstairs. We brush teeth (or I do<br/>\nand she watches a good portion of the time), get pjs on and head to bed for<br/>\na story. Sometimes Marti is in there for the story. Sometimes she isn&#39;t.
