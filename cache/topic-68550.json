Sorry to spoil any of the exclusivity of that, but let this be a preview, instead. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about socialization, and I wrote it a few weeks ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nSocialization&quot; is a harsh word that sounds soft.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was in school, the only bad grades I got were in conduct.  Because I talked to other kids at school, I would be given Cs in &quot;deportment&quot; or conduct.  I was socializing.  I heard several times over my public school years, &quot;You&#39;re not here to socialize.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when homeschooling&#39;s critics ask &quot;What about socialization?&quot; what they&#39;re envisioning is children playing with other children, and learning how to work together.   In reality, there are schools where conversation is forbidden during lunchtime.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Socialization,&quot; though, is something done to people.  It&#39;s a kind of training, &quot;to socialize&quot; a person.  And schools do that very, very badly.  The things children actually learn in school include being sneaky, pretending to read, bluffing their way through classes, padding their writing with fluff, and bullying without being caught.  I never wanted my children &quot;socialized&quot; in that environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens instead when a family creates a good homeschooling experience for their children (unschooling or structured), the children meet and interact with people of different ages, rather than just 20 or 30 others of the same age, overseen by a single adult.  They are actually having discussions and activities involving different humans in the real world, doing real things rather than practice things.  They are being social, and becoming social, through real world social interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n_____________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"Robyn Coburn &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Joining Group Activities","postDate":"1344790651","msgId":68578,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PC0zMDYzNzAwMTY5ODYwMjc4NzI5QHVua25vd25tc2dpZD4="},"prevInTopic":68574,"nextInTopic":68579,"prevInTime":68577,"nextInTime":68579,"topicId":68550,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sounds to me like there has not been sufficient Deschooling.

He & I were in the room the whole time.  The workshop was only 1.5 hrs each day.  After the initial 5 min. of anxiety, my son enjoyed it, and was quite willing to return the second day.  The first day, all the kids were together while the parents just hung out on the sidelines, and the second day, my husband & I worked alongside the boys helping them edit the videos they&#39;d created.  All four of us learned to use software on our home computer that we previously hadn&#39;t known how to use, plus the kids each came home with a short video they&#39;d made themselves - so in retrospect, it was a positive experience for us all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I do hear your point: signing them up for things without their consent, and pushing them to do an activity (even though they ended up enjoying it) does not help build a trusting relationship.  My son&#39;s tears were proof of that.  I humbly appreciate your pointing out what we&#39;ve been doing.  I will try to change that (.....I&#39;m pausing as I type this, contemplating the results of GUIDING rather than PUSHING.  This seems to be about my giving up some control over them, changing my role a bit, I guess this is all part of de-schooling myself...)  <br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the question of joining group activities, I still have a question about my younger son, as I mentioned in my original post.  I truly believe he&#39;d enjoy playing soccer and/or t-ball with a team this fall, but when I suggested it to him, he immediately rejected the idea, though as a 6-yr-old, he doesn&#39;t actually know what it would be like.  If we were not unschoolers, I would probably just sign him up anyway, and knowing him (he is athletic and a natural team-player), he&#39;d end up really enjoying it.  But since I&#39;m trying harder to build trust, I don&#39;t want to make him go when he says he doesn&#39;t want to.  It just seems a shame for him to miss out because he rejected the idea without even knowing what it entailed.  Any thoughts?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; People NEVER ask &quot;what about socializing?&quot;<br/>\n&gt; They ask, &quot;What about socialization?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>. <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; You and your husband are trying to enforce some &quot;socialization.&quot;  It is NOT socializing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Thank you.

However, despite me being an introvert, and knowing the discomfort of being made to stay longer than that, when we do leave &#39;early&#39; I&#39;ve had a quiet voice in my mind saying &quot;But... What if he should stay&quot;. I&#39;ve not acted on it or vocalised it, and now I realise it&#39;s just the tape in my head of all the extroverts who used to make me feel that there was something wrong with me.

If introverts ran the world we&#39;d make extroverts spend 8 hours a day by themselves so they weren&#39;t so dependent on being around other people to feel okay ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing an introvert, being forced to be social everyday in school was exhausting and intimidating for me. I didn&#39;t learn how to be more social. I learned how to blend into the wall so no one noticed me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter, on the other hand, who is also an introvert, does marvelously well with groups. She had the freedom to choose when to be with other people and when to be at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople learn how to interact with others by watching others interact. But put an introvert in a new group situation, they&#39;re not focused outward at other people. They&#39;re focused inward. They&#39;re focused on their discomfort. They&#39;re not learning. Or not learning to socialize! They&#39;re learning they&#39;re awkward unlike the others around them. They&#39;re learning they&#39;re different and different is bad. They&#39;re learning they don&#39;t like being in groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way for introverts to learn to socialize is with the people they&#39;re comfortable with: their family. And then whatever friends they feel comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when they&#39;re older and their desire to get something from a group is greater than their discomfort of being in a group, they&#39;ll have the skills they picked up from people they trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could give them a handful of tips on how to interact with people in a couple of minutes. (The best being: &quot;Study other people who make you feel comfortable.&quot; :-)) But the best social skill they can have is being comfortable in their own skin, knowing that who they are is okay, so that they can turn their attention to other people when they&#39;re in social situations. And *that* doesn&#39;t come from being told their feelings about their discomfort aren&#39;t to be trusted, that they don&#39;t know what they need, that other people know them better than they know themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; no matter what it is, they refuse to give it a chance. ...

Look at your own kids. What do they like? What bring them joy? What floats their boats?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the worst parenting practices that has spread is dismissing kids&#39; happiness as an indicator of how well they&#39;re doing. Parents &quot;have to&quot; send them to school which make kids miserable. Parents &quot;have to&quot; tell them no which makes them upset. Parents &quot;have to&quot; make them do chores, get up, go to bed, eat their liver ... all of which make them unhappy. Conventional parents must steel themselves against their children&#39;s unhappiness in order to be &quot;good&quot; parents. Kids happiness makes parenting more *convenient* but is justified as not an important factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and contentment are vitally important to growing up whole. Happiness is a good indicator of those.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; It is frustrating that my 6-yr-old, who<br/>\n&gt; is more confident socially, is following his brother&#39;s lead<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I suspect he&#39;s following his own &quot;lead&quot; but the fact that his brother can stay home is letting him know it&#39;s okay to stay home too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like he may be more of a social introvert. Extroverts get recharged by being with people and find being alone draining. Introverts get recharged by being alone and find groups draining. Social introverts enjoy other people but similarly get recharged by being alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though he has absorbed the skills to be social, he needs that recharge time. He&#39;s spent so much time with forced socialization that he needs a long time alone to recharge.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;ll let you know when he&#39;s ready for social activities.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; But I think they&#39;re not giving things a chance and missing out<br/>\n&gt; on social interactions and learning new skills/sports that they<br/>\n&gt; would likely end up really enjoying. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They seem to be enjoying what they&#39;re doing but you&#39;re looking elsewhere. While unschooling parents should keep the environment lively, bringing in new things to leave about -- see Sandra&#39;s Strewing page ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/strewing\">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a> ) --, new or old favorites of yours TV shows and movies, taking them places -- a new playground, a new grocery store, an historical re-enactment, a polo match -- the indicator of how well you&#39;re doing should be your kids peace, contentment and happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey need time to recover from school, including school at home. They need time to recover from being forced to be social. It&#39;s like the time spent laying on the couch letting a broken leg set. The leg heals slower if someone is forced to be up doing things while the leg is working hard at healing. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour kids will let you know when they need more. If they don&#39;t do something this year that interests them, they&#39;ll do it next year. Or the year after. Or when they&#39;re 15.

Are they pining for friends? From your description, it seems like they&#39;re enjoying getting closer to one another and taking a break from the kinds of group activities that they had to deal with when they were in school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; The only social interaction they get is informally playing with kids in the neighborhood, and with relatives (a few times a month).<br/>\n </span></blockquote>****************<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s adding up to something more than once a week - which could be plenty for them - once a week or even less can be plenty for some kids! My daughter is a strong introvert and there are times when one outing a week pushes her limit of &quot;social time&quot;. If your guys are enjoying playing together, they may not need very much in the way of outings at all. How nice that they&#39;re so close!<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool sets up an unrealistic expectation as to how much time kids need to socialize with other people, especially other kids. In reality, social kids can find school frustrating because so much of the time they&#39;re not Allowed to socialize, while introverts can spend a lot of energy shutting down because there are too many people around. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;(when he went to school and when he joined activities when he was younger, he never cried - it&#39;s something new since we started homeschooling.)<br/>\n </span></blockquote>*************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really normal once kids relax away from the pressures of school to start seeing more emotional reactions. Kids in school learn early that it&#39;s neither safe nor particularly helpful to express their feelings. Crying doesn&#39;t get them out of school, or out of doing the various activities in school. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;I think they&#39;re not giving things a chance and missing out on social interactions and learning new skills/sports that they would likely end up really enjoying<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to flip that sentiment around - maybe from their perspective, you&#39;re not giving them a chance to spend time at home, doing things on their own or together or with their parents, learning about themselves and their world in ways which are comfortable for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you keep pushing activities at them, they won&#39;t get a chance to decide they want to do things out of the home - they&#39;ll only get to choose yes or no to what you push at them. If you keep pushing &quot;socialization&quot; on them, they won&#39;t get a chance to discover how they like to learn about other people.

I&#39;ve been homeschooling my two boys (ages 6 & 9) almost a year now, unschooling for the last 5 months.  I&#39;m looking for ideas to give my sons more interaction with other kids, and help them feel more confident approaching social situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a suburban area where there are plenty of extracurricular activities they could participate in, but every time I suggest something, no matter what it is, they refuse to give it a chance.  The only social interaction they get is informally playing with kids in the neighborhood, and with relatives (a few times a month).  We also go to the local playground every few days but they mostly play with each other.  Neither is the type to strike up conversations with people they don&#39;t know.  Neither has any close friends.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy main concern is my older son.  He attended public school through 2nd grade.  He didn&#39;t develop any close friendships (in fact, near the end of his time there he was bullied by the two kids he usually hung out with at recess).  When he was younger we put him in various extracurricular activities and he definitely enjoyed some of them, but the last year or two, he&#39;s been uninterested in participating in any organized activity, and the most recent activities were, in my opinion, not well-run and I don&#39;t blame him for not liking them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLast week we took him to a 2-day workshop at the Apple Store (dh had signed him up, without consulting him).  Ds was very reluctant to participate, and right before things were to begin, he actually had tears in his eyes.  (when he went to school and when he joined activities when he was younger, he never cried - it&#39;s something new since we started homeschooling.)  Anyway, things turned out ok because they let my other son participate so he had his little brother right there, and the activity turned out to be fun for him - making music and movies on the iPad.  But...<br/>\n<br/>\nDh was upset when he saw the way ds was acting.  He said his behavior&#39;s gotten too extreme, he&#39;s too isolated, and he should be put back in school.  I don&#39;t agree that putting him in school would solve much, and I&#39;m confident I can dissuade dh from this, but I do agree dh has a point: ds&#39;s behavior has become more extreme since taking him out of school and I&#39;m not sure how to help him.  It used to seem that he was simply uninterested in trying new activities.  Now it seems to be a fear of social situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow (this time of year) there are lots of opportunities to sign up for extracurricular activities.  I feel pressure to have them interact more formally with others, to show dh (and the countless others who ask &quot;what about socializing?&quot;) that they ARE socializing.  I need to make a decision in the next week or two before deadlines arrive, what to sign them up for -- but everything I suggest, they say they don&#39;t want to do, and I&#39;m wary of committing to things &quot;behind their backs&quot;.  (It is frustrating that my 6-yr-old, who is more confident socially, is following his brother&#39;s lead: when I asked him yesterday if he&#39;d prefer to play soccer or wiffleball -both of which he loves, though he&#39;s never been part of a team before- he said &quot;I don&#39;t want to do those stupid things!&quot; or something along those lines.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I understand about unschooling, I should let the kids take the lead and choose what and if they want to join group activities.  But I think they&#39;re not giving things a chance and missing out on social interactions and learning new skills/sports that they would likely end up really enjoying.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for reading this, and I look forward to your advice.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27362,"nextTopicId":68612}}
