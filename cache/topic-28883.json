Seven years and a few countries later (Germany, England, <br/>\nand now, the USA), we&#39;re currently looking for the white rabbit in <br/>\nLawrence, Kansas, which has turned out to be the biggest culture <br/>\nshock of all. In looking at the learning smorgasbord, the two older <br/>\nkids have done an eclectic mix of school classes, community classes, <br/>\nonline classes, and didacticism. This led us to the college prep <br/>\ngame, which our oldest child has decided to play. So, we&#39;ve spent <br/>\nthe last several months studying the rules of the game commonly <br/>\nreferred to as college admissions, with special emphasis on &quot;What Do <br/>\nYou Really Need to Know to Take the ACT/SAT?&quot; We found we had a bit <br/>\nof a strategic advantage, because prior to all of our overseas <br/>\nadventures, I had earned an M.A. and Ph.D. in rhetoric from the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  University of South Carolina (where I also taught composition and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>literature).

Seven years and a few countries later (Germany, England, and now, the USA), we&#39;re currently looking for the white rabbit in Lawrence, Kansas, which has turned out to be the biggest culture shock of all. In looking at the learning smorgasbord, the two older kids have done an eclectic mix of school classes, community classes, online classes, and didacticism. This led us to the college prep game, which our oldest child has decided to play. So, we&#39;ve spent the last several months studying the rules of the game commonly referred to as college admissions, with special emphasis on &quot;What Do You Really Need to Know to Take the ACT/SAT?&quot; We found we had a bit of a strategic advantage, because prior to all of our overseas adventures, I had earned an M.A. and Ph.D. in rhetoric from the<br/>\n University of South Carolina (where I also taught composition and literature). This has left me fairly fluent in academese.<br/>\n  Sheila will host:<br/>\n  Unschoolers and the ACT/SAT Writing Tests: No Problem!<br/>\n  Do &quot;composition&quot; and &quot;compost&quot; really have the same root? If so, just what is meant by &quot;good writing&quot;?<br/>\n  Explore this and other questions related to showing your stuff on the ACT or SAT writing section with minimal damage to self and sanity. This session is for students (and their parents) interested in taking the ACT/SAT as part of their pre-college preparation. They are, of course, not required, but they&#39;re also not as formidable as they&#39;ve been made to appear.<br/>\n<br/>\n        <br/>\n                    <br/>\nCall or email Barb Lundgren with questions or to register!
