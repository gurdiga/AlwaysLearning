I still ended up feeling inadequate. My mom has never been one to spend a lot of time making herself up. The only make-up I&#39;ve ever seen her wear is lipstick. She has always worn her hair natural. The most she does as far as styling it is blow drying but that&#39;s it. She doesn&#39;t style it with a special brush and hair goop. She just blows it dry. She never, ever wore high heels because they were uncomfortable and impractical. My dad has essentially the same opinion of how women looked. He doesn&#39;t think big, fancy, styled hair and lots of make-up is attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was embarrassed by her. I thought she was uncool, too intellectual to be pretty. I got messages outside my family and their friends from a very young age (probably in 2nd grade at school) that is was not good for girls to be too smart. Mostly, they should be pretty and nice. I worshiped my friends&#39; mothers who had make-up and fancy clothes and high heels. Oh, how I loved high heeled shoes! I wished my mother were more like them. I wished she would help style my hair and put on make-up so I would be as pretty as those other girls. I always felt not quite pretty enough, which is kind of funny considering that people close to my mother talked about how pretty she was and that I looked just like her. One of her adult male friends even told me once when I was probably 10 or 12 that I couldn&#39;t rely solely on my looks my whole life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got major mixed messages. Maybe that&#39;s why I never felt pretty enough even though lots of people told me I was or smart enough even though I was &quot;gifted&quot; in school. Those messages about self and body image come from so many sources. I can&#39;t pinpoint any specific source that influenced me. Those ideas are everywhere. Maybe my problem was that my parents never told me I was beautiful just as I am or that I was good enough in any way. My seemed oblivious to it all and my father was too busy trying to make sure I didn&#39;t end up just like my mother. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] I have to share","postDate":"1272418658","msgId":53517,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGwycDNhOTNmZmYxMTAwNDI3MTgzN24xOTgwOGQ0M29kMGM4MWY0OWU1Zjk0MGE1QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIzMTY5NS44NTE3OS5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDQzMTg1OC41NzM2OC5xbUB3ZWI1MzAwMi5tYWlsLnJlMi55YWhvby5jb20+CSA8czJwZmQ4YjAxMjYxMDA0MjYyMzAzaDEzYjdlZDI2bzNlZGEwMWNlNDA3MDdjZTVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8NEJENkRGODYuMjAzMDEwMUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0PgkgPDMzNjMyNS43NDE5LnFtQHdlYjgxNTA2Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JIDw4NkQ0RDY0NS03QjZELTRGNTctQjRDOC03RjRDRjI0NTM3RjVAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CSA8Nzc1NDA0LjM3NzY1LnFtQHdlYjgxNTAyLm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JIDw2NDkzNjIuNTY1NTUucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDE1Lm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JIDwyMzE2OTUuODUxNzkucW1Ad2ViODE1MDIubWFpbC5tdWQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53516,"nextInTopic":53526,"prevInTime":53516,"nextInTime":53518,"topicId":53479,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My mom s parents worked in a NC textile factory (near Durham) all their lives.

This was the 70s<br/>\nwhen people were just starting to talk about natural unmade-up beauty. Once<br/>\nI left home and stopped having constant reminders about my looks and what to<br/>\ndo with them, I got to the point in my late 20s where it didn&#39;t matter to<br/>\nme.
