The standard response.<br/>\nI&#39;ll think about incorporating a special day for each of them, besides their birthday. They would love it.<br/>\nThanks for the idea!<br/>\n<br/>\nKarin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:35 PM<br/>\n  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Julian Day<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 12/10/2001 9:02:52 PM Eastern Standard Time, <br/>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; If it&#39;s a bigger thing, we<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;might ask him to wait until Christmas or a birthday (Or Julian Day, another<br/>\n  &gt; &gt;story).<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; OK, Let&#39;s hear it!<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n  Okay...here it is...<br/>\n  Remember when you were a kid, around Mother&#39;s Day or Father&#39;s day, and asked <br/>\n  your parents &quot;When is Children&#39;s Day?&quot;  Remember what they said?<br/>\n<br/>\n  &quot;Everyday is Children&#39;s Day.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  Well, when Julian asked (when he was about 5), we set a date, and now, every <br/>\n  year, we have a Julian Day.
