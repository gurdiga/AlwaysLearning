(Not as compared to a small or a large, but as in a means of <br/>\nexpression, as language is, as painting or drawing is, as massage or dance or <br/>\narchitecture is.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs English has lots of forms--simple baby talk, repetition of traditional <br/>\nforms (poems, jokes, riddles, fairy tales, urban myths), communication at <br/>\nhigher and lower levels, discussions of God or of bugs, of pathos or <br/>\nsilliness, giving directions, scaring bad guys away--the whole range of <br/>\nSPOKEN English can be experienced without even touching on reading and <br/>\nwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with music.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGeorge Harrison just died.  As far as I know, he couldn&#39;t read music.  (Maybe <br/>\nhe could later, but couldn&#39;t at first.)  He was undoubtedly a musician.  He <br/>\n&quot;composed&quot; music, but he did it aurally and not on paper.  He knew that <br/>\nlanguage as a native speaker, and he knew it well, but he was &quot;illiterate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who understand math well and use it in their own mental <br/>\nways, but if they don&#39;t recognize the traditional format of the formula the <br/>\n&quot;real mathematicians&quot; use as their proof and model, they&#39;re considered <br/>\n&quot;illiterate.&quot;  Only with math, much more than with music or English, there <br/>\nseem to be professionals and teachers who don&#39;t realize or don&#39;t acknowledge <br/>\nthat there is a huge world of math outside their written language for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are music teachers too, though, who want NOTHING to do with any playing <br/>\nby ear.  They consider it gypsy lowlife nonsense for people to just make <br/>\nmusic up, or to waste their time &quot;playing wrong&quot; when they should go to a <br/>\nteacher and be taught JUST how to hold a guitar, or JUST how to use a violin <br/>\n&quot;right.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are English teachers who shun street rhymes or jokes or regional <br/>\ndialects in favor of &quot;reading level&quot; and appreciation of &quot;good literature&quot; <br/>\n(meaning the same things the teacher was forced to read and told how to <br/>\nappreciate).  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschoolers can get away from those small, narrow, formal traditions.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly is really good at all kinds of mathematical thinking.  She can sing <br/>\ntoo.  So I see her doing music by ear (and she&#39;s learning fiddle, and she <br/>\ndinks out melodies on the piano and remembers them later, and sees the <br/>\npatterns), but I don&#39;t teach her &quot;notation.&quot;   And she&#39;s started figuring out <br/>\naverages in her head (because if she joins a Five Crowns game late we <br/>\n&quot;average her in&quot;) and she does tricky calculations in ways she has created on <br/>\nher own.  I don&#39;t teach her &quot;notation&quot; except what she asks for.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the advantage with Holly, who is lately ten, is that she has NO fear <br/>\nwhatsoever of math or music (and in fact doesn&#39;t even see them as different, <br/>\nseparate things as school kids so clearly do).  The patterns in numbers and <br/>\nthe patterns in music are both fun and sweet for her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was good with math but bad with notation and so was shut out of <br/>\nmathematical progress and acceptance in school, and it DID scare me.  I did <br/>\nokay on SAT&#39;s, but creditted it to being a good guesser.  I don&#39;t have a good <br/>\nmemory for numbers, but that doesn&#39;t keep me from figuring out fresh <br/>\nquestions.  (I just need to write down the final figures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I&#39;m thinking that the dad in question might be seeing only the written <br/>\nnotation of math as real math, and not the mathematical thinking and <br/>\npattern-finding.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeith&#39;s here; he says he might have the second part of his math writing in <br/>\ne-mail at work and will check today when he goes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"Joan","from":"Joan &lt;les.carlson2@...&gt;","profile":"lmncarlson","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"q7__0YyKjCUx3YHCOScjIfl_x9_BGJBY67iW5SgLP9uxmeFqT0SSCNHrOuT0jb-B6wpw-n4I-uLssk3D2KTldwpZ3z4pVUc","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Math Anxiety,--is recovery possible?","postDate":"1007130895","msgId":133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDMDc5OTBGLjVGRkIyRUJAc3ltcGF0aWNvLmNhPg==","referencesHeader":"PDEwMDcxMjI5OTUuMTY0LjQxODA1Lm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":136,"prevInTime":132,"nextInTime":134,"topicId":133,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Deborah wrote, I know a lot of people who have acres of books without a single book on math to be found.
