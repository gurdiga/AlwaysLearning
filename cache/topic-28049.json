I am very much like you... new to unschooling, mommy <br/>\nto young children and former teacher.  I very much wanted <br/>\nto &#39;structure&#39; my 3 y.o&#39;s day because that is what I was taught to do <br/>\nas a preschool teacher and also as a 2nd and 1st grade teacher. <br/>\n<br/>\nI ran into the same problems and more.  When it was &#39;time&#39; to do <br/>\nreading, there was no way I was going to interupt her block building <br/>\ntime, and when she was reading, there was no way I was going to stop <br/>\nher just to tell her that its &#39;time&#39; to do art.  And sometimes <br/>\nreading would happen all day and no art would get done, and other <br/>\ndays all she wants to do is art and no reading will get done; and I <br/>\nhad to LET GO of my expectations and learn that SHE knows the best <br/>\nway that SHE learns.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNot to mention that the AAP came out with a new study that emphasises <br/>\nthe importance of play- Free, unstructured, unscheduled play time is <br/>\nESSENTIAL for social, emotional, and cognitive development!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aap.org/pressroom/play-public.htm\">http://www.aap.org/pressroom/play-public.htm</a>  <br/>\n<br/>\nReading that study just confirmed to me what I already knew in my <br/>\nheart and helped me let go of my own schedules in favor of hers. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read an eye opening speech by John Taylor Gatto (his teacher of the <br/>\nyear acceptance speech) that talked about how children&#39;s focus is <br/>\nmade to be shortened by school bells that ring at arbitrary times so <br/>\nchildren have to stop what they are doing and go to the next class. <br/>\n(Think pavlov&#39;s dogs and his bells) All of this &#39;school&#39; type of <br/>\nstucture is really only to move the MASSES of children in a way that <br/>\nworks for the school, not for the best interest of the individual <br/>\nchild. So why would I try to emulate that at home?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still learning about unschooling, like you.

My name is Angel and I am new to the group and more so new to <br/>\n&gt; the concept of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Truthfully I have no idea what it is <br/>\n&gt; really is.  I am a former school teacher who now is a SAHM. I love <br/>\n&gt; it!  I have a wonderful four year old boy and I started his day <br/>\nlike <br/>\n&gt; I would if he were in a pre-k classroom.  I had lesson plans and <br/>\n&gt; materials ready to enrich his world.  Well, my son was not having <br/>\n&gt; it.  I am NOT a ditto or workbook kind of mommy or teacher.  The <br/>\n&gt; activities I provided were based on interest and a variety of <br/>\n&gt; materials-play-doh, paint, dirt, etc.   But any effort I made <br/>\nseemed <br/>\n&gt; to be shot down by my son.  So, I thought okay I will allow my boy <br/>\n&gt; to pick out the book when it is story time, I will allow him to <br/>\npick <br/>\n&gt; the songs to sing, and material to use, but the schedule to do <br/>\nthese <br/>\n&gt; activities will remain the same as before.  Well, that does not <br/>\nseem <br/>\n&gt; to be working either.  So, one day I just let him do his own thing <br/>\n&gt; and I was there to be his mommy, playmate, and resource whenever he <br/>\n&gt; needed me.  AND GUESS WHAT- I observed so much learning and <br/>\n&gt; excitement from my little boy. I was told that this is a form of <br/>\n&gt; unschooling, is it???? I have some more info I have included and I <br/>\n&gt; could sure use your advice.  I do not want to teach my son based on <br/>\n&gt; my &quot;teaching degree.&quot;  I want to teach my son to develop a love for <br/>\n&gt; learning that would be in the best of his interest. Thanks.<br/>\n&gt; Ok, I have had wonderful answers about how you do it. But now I <br/>\n&gt; would love to know and for us to share; What do you do?  Ok, I am <br/>\n&gt; allowing my son&#39;s learning and activities to be based on his <br/>\n&gt; interests.  I have set up a routine schedule. For example: In the <br/>\n&gt; morning we will do story time and he picks out the story. During <br/>\n&gt; another part of the day it is sensory time and my boy picks out the <br/>\n&gt; sensory activity.  Although, he has the freedom to pick out the <br/>\nbook <br/>\n&gt; or activity, he may not be motivated at that time to do it. Well, <br/>\nIt <br/>\n&gt; is not working for me. I redo the schedule and I reschedule all the <br/>\n&gt; activities and you know what it keeps changing.  It was so much <br/>\n&gt; easier being a classroom teacher.  I thought having a routine chart <br/>\n&gt; would work and provide structured. However, my son may not be <br/>\n&gt; physically and mentally ready for that activity during that <br/>\nspecific <br/>\n&gt; time of day.  He is a YOUNG four year old.  Do you have this <br/>\n&gt; problem? Alright moms, I need your advice and input.  My son is <br/>\nvery <br/>\n&gt; well behaved and is responsible about helping around the home and <br/>\n&gt; being considerate of others, but should I just do story time  when <br/>\n&gt; he picks up a book and says, &quot;mommy, please read this story to me?&quot; <br/>\n&gt; Should I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long <br/>\n&gt; as learning and teaching responsibility occurs? Should the <br/>\n&gt; activities happen based on spontaneous learning?  Moms, it would be <br/>\n&gt; nice to know how it works for you.  I do not want the &quot;loving-<br/>\n&gt; control&quot; part of me to come before the natural interest of my son.  <br/>\n&gt; Am I making any sense?????<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: New and I could use your input","postDate":"1171748681","msgId":28060,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVDOUM5NkZELUJCNjgtNDVDOC05NzY2LTMxQUUyREExQ0FDOUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGVyN25paStiN21uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVyN25paStiN21uQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28059,"nextInTopic":28065,"prevInTime":28059,"nextInTime":28061,"topicId":28049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"John Holt in What Do I Do Monday?

In  your post, <br/>\nit sounded as if you realized that, but then you lapsed back into  routines <br/>\nand structure.  I know that some people who are new to the idea of  unschooling <br/>\nsee it as an easy, almost lazy approach to parenting.  They are  overwhelmed <br/>\nwith thoughts of all the things their children will not be  getting.  The truth <br/>\nis that unschooling is often far more difficult on the  parent than teaching <br/>\nwould be.  It&#39;s hard to relinquish control.  It&#39;s  hard to trust your children <br/>\nto know what they want and need.  It  shouldn&#39;t be, but sometimes it is.  You <br/>\nshould read plenty about  unschooling and lurk here for a while in order to <br/>\nget a feel for what  unschooling really is (and isn&#39;t).  In the meantime, while <br/>\nyou soak up all  you can, keep in mind how your son blossomed when you put <br/>\nhis day into his  own hands.  Let the contentment that you saw and how it made <br/>\nyou feel  be your focus.  You have a wonderful opportunity to give your son a  <br/>\nlife of freedom and of choice.  Believe me, learning will happen on its  own.  <br/>\n You&#39;ve made a great first step.  Don&#39;t let fear and your  own conditioning <br/>\nmake you doubt the joy you witnessed first hand when you  allowed your child <br/>\nthe freedom to choose how he spent his day.   A happy child will be your reward. <br/>\n Good  luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] New and I could use your input","postDate":"1171648117","msgId":28050,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFNTIyQkVFLUQwRjQtNDRBMC1BMzNFLTA0NkRGRUUyNzQ1QUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGVyNG8wZytxN2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGVyNG8wZytxN2xpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":28049,"nextInTopic":28051,"prevInTime":28049,"nextInTime":28051,"topicId":28049,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-...new to the concept of unschooling.

My name is Angel and I am new to the group and more so new to <br/>\nthe concept of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Truthfully I have no idea what it is <br/>\nreally is.  I am a former school teacher who now is a SAHM. I love <br/>\nit!  I have a wonderful four year old boy and I started his day like <br/>\nI would if he were in a pre-k classroom.  I had lesson plans and <br/>\nmaterials ready to enrich his world.  Well, my son was not having <br/>\nit.  I am NOT a ditto or workbook kind of mommy or teacher.  The <br/>\nactivities I provided were based on interest and a variety of <br/>\nmaterials-play-doh, paint, dirt, etc.   But any effort I made seemed <br/>\nto be shot down by my son.  So, I thought okay I will allow my boy <br/>\nto pick out the book when it is story time, I will allow him to pick <br/>\nthe songs to sing, and material to use, but the schedule to do these <br/>\nactivities will remain the same as before.  Well, that does not seem <br/>\nto be working either.  So, one day I just let him do his own thing <br/>\nand I was there to be his mommy, playmate, and resource whenever he <br/>\nneeded me.  AND GUESS WHAT- I observed so much learning and <br/>\nexcitement from my little boy. I was told that this is a form of <br/>\nunschooling, is it???? I have some more info I have included and I <br/>\ncould sure use your advice.  I do not want to teach my son based on <br/>\nmy &quot;teaching degree.&quot;  I want to teach my son to develop a love for <br/>\nlearning that would be in the best of his interest. Thanks.<br/>\nOk, I have had wonderful answers about how you do it. But now I <br/>\nwould love to know and for us to share; What do you do?  Ok, I am <br/>\nallowing my son&#39;s learning and activities to be based on his <br/>\ninterests.  I have set up a routine schedule. For example: In the <br/>\nmorning we will do story time and he picks out the story. During <br/>\nanother part of the day it is sensory time and my boy picks out the <br/>\nsensory activity.  Although, he has the freedom to pick out the book <br/>\nor activity, he may not be motivated at that time to do it. Well, It <br/>\nis not working for me. I redo the schedule and I reschedule all the <br/>\nactivities and you know what it keeps changing.  It was so much <br/>\neasier being a classroom teacher.  I thought having a routine chart <br/>\nwould work and provide structured. However, my son may not be <br/>\nphysically and mentally ready for that activity during that specific <br/>\ntime of day.  He is a YOUNG four year old.  Do you have this <br/>\nproblem? Alright moms, I need your advice and input.  My son is very <br/>\nwell behaved and is responsible about helping around the home and <br/>\nbeing considerate of others, but should I just do story time  when <br/>\nhe picks up a book and says, &quot;mommy, please read this story to me?&quot; <br/>\nShould I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long <br/>\nas learning and teaching responsibility occurs? Should the <br/>\nactivities happen based on spontaneous learning?  Moms, it would be <br/>\nnice to know how it works for you.  I do not want the &quot;loving-<br/>\ncontrol&quot; part of me to come before the natural interest of my son.  <br/>\nAm I making any sense?????</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28062,"nextTopicId":28054}}
