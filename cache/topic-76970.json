Bad things erode faith and trust.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was pulled from a post I made on someone’s facebook page, when someone I don’t know had bragged that she had told her young son that the ice cream man was dangerous or evil (I don’t remember the wording and it’s probably best not to quote her), and that it had saved her a small fortune.  In suggesting that it had also cost her trust and relationship, I wrote the line above.  And I saved it, which was good, because the person whose page it was on deleted it, and wrote to me.  The mom who told the story DID lose her relationships with her children, who are now grown, and her mental health is not good lately.   I didn’t mind it being pulled.  I was pretty direct, and this wasn’t a mom with young children anymore anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt was too late for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon’t let it be too late for you, if you’re reading this. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat’s above is just the past two days’ quotes and links. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe past couple of weeks&#39; of Just Add Light posts are:<br/>\n<br/>\nUp!<br/>\nGood to great<br/>\nBetter everything<br/>\nClutter or beauty?<br/>\nQuiet abundance<br/>\nTake your time<br/>\nSoft<br/>\nNormal<br/>\nAware of words<br/>\nStop time<br/>\nThis planet<br/>\nStop and hush<br/>\nHealth and contentment<br/>\nSleep when you’re tired<br/>\nEmpowering Others<br/>\nDark corners, lit up<br/>\nAcceptance and relaxation<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who read those by e-mail should sometimes go to the blog.  The formatting is nice, and each post has “You might also like” and it leads to three somehow-related posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the links above offered me a post with a photo of my daughter, Holly.  It’s called “See good, be good.”<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2014/12/see-good-be-good.html\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2014/12/see-good-be-good.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWithout happiness, contentment, peace, joy, unschooling will not flourish.  It might “work.” It might be passable.  Why settle for barely, sort of unschooling enough to… what?  to pass?  to not be criticized?  to not have social services come?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is something worth doing well, because it has the potential beyond the obvious.  A parent who can really understand these things and do them changes his or her own life as much as the children’s lives are changed.    <br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s a pretty big deal. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":446338733,"authorName":"Catherine","from":"Catherine &lt;cgoudou@...&gt;","profile":"cath01gb","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Being happier and more positive","postDate":"1461148435","msgId":76982,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU3MTc1QjEzLjgwNjAxMDdAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":76970,"nextInTopic":76984,"prevInTime":76981,"nextInTime":76983,"topicId":76970,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Two of my essays from years back have some of those ideas—joy over “happiness” and the idea of deciding what you’re looking for, so you can learn to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1742620568\">&quot;Two of my essays from years back have some of those ideas—joy over <br/>\n“happiness” and the idea of deciding what you’re looking for, so you can <br/>\nlearn to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/joy\">http://sandradodd.com/joy</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/seeingit\">http://sandradodd.com/seeingit</a> &quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis particularly resonates in me today !
