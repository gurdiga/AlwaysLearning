We found someone who understood all of<br/>\nthis and just took it one step at a time, at his pace.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome dentists advertise that they work with special needs kids, and they<br/>\ntend to be more sensitive in general as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, have you heard of xylitol? For a couple of years we brushed our teeth<br/>\nwith it straight as dh is a doc who just knows these things told us it<br/>\nhelped enormously with tooth decay. Then lo and behold Tom&#39;s toothpaste<br/>\nstarted adding xylitol and we use that now. Xylitol is a sweetener made from<br/>\nsugar, oddly enough, but does not spark the insulin reaction that straight<br/>\nsugar does, so it is great for people looking to avoid that, like diabetics.<br/>\nThe tooth health is another great benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had an area of my mouth that had been a problem for years (hate the<br/>\ndentist myself) where I was supposed to have a root canal or extraction, and<br/>\nwhen I started brushing with xylitol, all the symptoms went away. It&#39;s been<br/>\nfine for the last three years.

I wrote an article about my experience that was published in the<br/>\nlast (Sept) issue of Live Free, Learn Free.<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.livefreelearnfree.com for the back issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe short version is that Jayn was very reluctant to allow the several<br/>\ndental surgeons to work on her teeth, and they were all rude and pushy. At<br/>\nfirst we tried to persuade Jayn, but then we realized that we should listen<br/>\nto her first &quot;no&quot; at once, and just leave.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally after several tries we found a wonderful pediatric full-service<br/>\ndentist who was kind, has a great office space, and was understanding and<br/>\nnot trying to play on fears and create false urgency. When *Jayn* trusted<br/>\nher we moved forward, with no trauma.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese kind and nice dentists do exist - although &quot;holistic&quot; refers to a<br/>\nmedical philosophy more than necessarily a child-centered kindness<br/>\nphilosophy, as we found. They may still have the idea that the child should<br/>\ndo as they are told (for their own good of course). <br/>\n<br/>\nDentists speak another language. The receptionist will *always* say &quot;Oh yes,<br/>\nhe/she is very kind and gentle with the children&quot;. Humph. Continue to ask<br/>\nthe other attachment parents and Unschoolers in your local area for<br/>\nrecommendations. Visit the offices. Once you find the right person, you will<br/>\nbe amazed at how much better everyone feels.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrust your dd and your own feelings. You can find the right<br/>\npractitioner...really.
