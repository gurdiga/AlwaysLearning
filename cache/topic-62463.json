Maybe six or eight lives a medium amount.  But it shouldn&#39;t be swept away like a blade of grass chucked into a flood.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n=========<br/>\n<br/>\nJust before each of my kids read, they were calm and happy to have others read to them or for them, even if those other kids were younger, because I had talked to them about how differently different kids learn, even in school, and that there would always be some things they could do better than other people, so not to act smart or be mean about that, and some things others could do better or sooner than they could.  It&#39;s normal.   Humility.  I was helping my kids learn humility from a very young age.  I wrote about it a couple of times in discussions back then, 12-15 years ago, and each time another parent got QUITE huffy and said &quot;I don&#39;t WANT my child to be humble!&quot;   And I stopped writing about it.  But I learned over the years not to let someone&#39;s objections keep me from writing something I thought was important.  My kids at 19, 22 and 25 are still humble, not hateful, and open to the knowledge that others know things they don&#39;t, and rather than reject or resent that, they should use or appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":62432,"nextTopicId":62332}}
