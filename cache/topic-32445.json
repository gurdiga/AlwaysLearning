As a 62 year old, I deserve to be talked to and about in<br/>\na nice way just as a child does. Fortunately I have developed skills over<br/>\nthe years to deal with stress and in the best of all worlds parents have<br/>\nthese skills to pass on to their kids.

I have spent my whole life advocating<br/>\nfor children. My husband and I have grown kids that were never in school and<br/>\nwho were unschooled. I founded and was director of one of only two<br/>\nnon-coercive un-schools in the country that was publicly funded. At this<br/>\nun-school, young people ages 5 to 19 could spend their time (within the<br/>\nconstraints of safety) any way they chose. They were not separated by age<br/>\nand they pretty much ran the show. Parents, friends and siblings were always<br/>\nwelcome and it was not a prison. They could come and go at any time with<br/>\ntheir parents consent and they could attend the number of hours that they<br/>\nwanted. There was a process in place for kids to fire the staff if they<br/>\nchose to.

Unfortunately, Wendy&#39;s was crowded <br/>\nwith the lunch crowd.  Dd(8) asked if she and brother could go get a <br/>\ntable and wait while I orderd the food and I agreed.  They were <br/>\nsitting where I could see them if I leaned out from the long line I <br/>\nwas waiting in.  I kept looking back every minute or so and they <br/>\nseemed to be doing fine.  Then, it was my turn to order, and <br/>\nnaturally, that is when something happened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI got our food and headed to our table and ds was under the table <br/>\nwith his coat over his head crying.  I asked him to come out and he <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t.  I asked him if he was hurt and Dd said, &quot;No, he got in <br/>\ntrouble.&quot;  When I asked him to come out and tell me what happened, <br/>\nthe woman who cleans the table (probably in her 60&#39;s) came over and <br/>\nsaid, &quot;He was licking the salt and pepper shakers and so I had to <br/>\nthrow them away!&quot;  She was all in a huff.  Ds came out from under the <br/>\ntable (I was sitting on the floor by him) and crawled in my lap and <br/>\nhid his face.  He was obviously very upset.  I asked him if that is <br/>\nwhat he did and he shook his head no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nthen the lady sitting across from our table said in a very mad and <br/>\nirritated voice (she was probably also in her 60&#39;s I&#39;m guessing) &quot;do <br/>\nyou want me to tell you what he did?&quot;  and I replied, &quot;No, I&#39;ll let <br/>\nmy son tell me.&quot;  She said in a &quot;knowing&quot; sort of way, &quot;Yeah, I <br/>\nthought you&#39;d probably want him to tell you&quot; like she thought I&#39;d <br/>\npull the truth out of him and then punish him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDs would not tell me what happened.  I felt so upset because part of <br/>\nme wanted to find out what happened so that I could make amends, if <br/>\nneed be, and part of me wanted to just let him be since he was <br/>\nobviously so upset.  I told Ds that I promised I would not be mad at <br/>\nhim no matter what happened and that I was not going to punish him.  <br/>\nHe still wouldn&#39;t say anything except that he wanted to go home.  So <br/>\nwe started packing up our food. Dd said, &quot;Mommy, he wasn&#39;t licking <br/>\nthem, he had them under his nose and was smelling them.&quot;  then she <br/>\ndemonstrated what he was doing and I knew he was just trying to be <br/>\nsilly while they were waiting for their food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Ds if that was true, that he was smelling the shakers, not <br/>\nlicking them, and he nodded yes.  I asked him what the worker said to <br/>\nhim and he wouldn&#39;t talk.  The worker lady then came to our table and <br/>\npatted his back and said in a sickly sweet voice, &quot;It&#39;s okay.  I <br/>\nthrew them away.  Don&#39;t be upset.&quot;  Then she bent down and whispered <br/>\nwickedly, &quot;But if you do it again, I&#39;ll take you over my knee and <br/>\nspank you!&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI looked at her and said, &quot;No, you will not spank my child.  I do not <br/>\nspank him and you certainly will not spank him.&quot;  She said she was <br/>\nonly teasing.  I said, &quot;I apologize for what he did, but really it <br/>\nwas my fault.  I should not have left them unattended at the table <br/>\nand we should not have come at such a busy time.  I&#39;m the one who was <br/>\nwrong, not my child.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe left and on the way out, another older lady (Man, must be the day <br/>\nfor older ladies to go to Wendy&#39;s!) caught up with me as we were <br/>\nheaded to our car and told me that that old worker lady was really <br/>\nmean to Matthew and that she said some very unkind things.  She <br/>\ncalled her &quot;That mean old lady&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found out that she told Ds that he would have to pay for a new <br/>\nset of shakers.  I cannot believe she would tell that to a 5 year <br/>\nold!  I am so mad about this situation, and even more upset with <br/>\nmyself because I don&#39;t think I stood up enough for my child.  I <br/>\nshould have probably gone to the manager or something.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHow should I have handled this situation?  What could I have done <br/>\ndifferently?  I would like to know if anyone else has experienced <br/>\nsimilar situations and how you handled them so that in the future, <br/>\nI&#39;ll be better prepared.  Boy, wish I could just wave a magic wand <br/>\nand have all the experience and knowledge some of you have on this <br/>\nsite!  Being new to unschooling sucks in a way because I have the <br/>\ndrive and desire, but not the experience or knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32547,"nextTopicId":32578}}
