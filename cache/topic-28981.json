Re: housekeeping, eating, and unschooling<br/>\n    Posted by: &quot;Sandra Dodd&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were older, I wanted to get rid of all our plastic<br/>\ndishes but they&#39;re still attached to some of their favorites.  We&#39;ve<br/>\nmoved steadily more toward ceramic and glass though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-==-=-=-=<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s funny. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a pool and a brand new bitchin&#39; deck (thanks to Ren&#39;s sweet <br/>\nhusband, Bleu). Because of that, we&#39;re eating even more meals outside <br/>\nnow. But due to the pool and stuff, we also have lots of bare feet.... <br/>\nSo we&#39;ve moved from ceramic and glass to almost ALL plastic. Plates, <br/>\nstemware, flatware, bowls, serving pieces, etc.  All &quot;tropical&quot; hues. <br/>\n&lt;g&gt;  In fact, I have a ton of new plastic-ware for parties (26 guests <br/>\njust left a party (fajitas & margaritas) at our house tonight).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe older we all get, the more we move towards plastic. Go figure! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to the topic: our lives are pretty clean and orderly, but I <br/>\nhave two onlies (19 & 11). But it&#39;s different for each family: if one <br/>\nfamily runs on &quot;clean&quot; and homemade, then someone needs to make that <br/>\nhappen (I choose cook from scratch and clean a lot! While others <br/>\nsleep.).  But if paper plates and convenience foods and clutter give <br/>\nmore time to the kids, that&#39;s what needs to happen. People before <br/>\nthings, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly Lovejoy<br/>\nConference Coordinator<br/>\nLive and Learn Unschooling Conference<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org\">http://www.LiveandLearnConference.org</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nAOL now offers free email to everyone.
