In a country where homeschooling, not to mention unschooling, is controversial at best, it REALLY helped smooth things over with my in-laws when we took our daughter out of the public school system. After reading the suggested curriculum folder Clonlara sent (which we never used for anything other than that), my mother-in-law said something like, &quot;Well, it&#39;s pretty complete.&quot; And that was that. I have to send in a report of what she&#39;s doing and grades (decided on by my daughter and me) to her tutor, but so far, there haven&#39;t been any required projects, reading, tests or anything. We didn&#39;t start out unschooling, but gradually moved towards it, so it was great to have the freedom to make that transition while still being able to show the in-laws and social services the official looking papers that made them feel more at ease. Having said all of that, we won&#39;t be signing her up for another year. It served its purpose, but it is rather expensive for us and right now she really doesn&#39;t care about a high school diploma. We&#39;re more confident about it all now, plus she only has one more year with the possiblity of problems with the authorities. If she changes her mind, we&#39;ll sign her up again, but for now we&#39;d rather spend the money taking her to places she wants to visit. <br/>\nRenee<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I don&#39;t know any more about Clonlara than what I&#39;ve read online.
