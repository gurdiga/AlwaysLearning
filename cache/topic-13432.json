I&#39;m not going <br/>\nto volunteer any answers.  There are lots of others who will.    But when I <br/>\nsay I buy my kids all the candy they want, I&#39;m telling the truth.  And <br/>\nprobably some parents are picturing half a cart of candy, $65.   But WEEKS go <br/>\nby where nobody wants any candy whatsoever.   Maybe once every couple of <br/>\nmonths I get cookies.  It takes a few days for them to go.  Last time, a <br/>\nweek.  More often I make cookies, and they go at a slow and dignified pace, <br/>\nnot like when I was a kid and people at my house ate everything they could <br/>\nshovel in because if they didn&#39;t someone else would.  Unless there were six <br/>\nor twelve.  Then the math was obvious.  A dozen donuts, six people, each got <br/>\ntwo.  ONLY two.  Non-transferable donuts.  At our house if a dozen donuts <br/>\ncome in nobody counts, and two usually petrify in the box.  Nobody knows who <br/>\ndid or didn&#39;t eat three, or one, or none.  And nobody cares.  Because IF they <br/>\nwant more, we&#39;ll buy more.   And obviously they&#39;re not desperate for more, as <br/>\nthe last mummified donuts will attest.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo &quot;All the donuts you want&quot; when I worked at Dunkin Donuts became &quot;one, <br/>\nMAYBE&quot; by the third day.  After a week, it was none.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd &quot;All the donuts you want&quot; is about the same way at my house now.  Donuts <br/>\ncome in here three or four times a YEAR.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if we got donuts once a week and counted them and made kids eat spinach <br/>\nto get them, they would be eating two donuts a week and dreaming of the next <br/>\ndonut eating opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t deal when with <br/>\ncriticism when it&#39;s not veiled in niceties. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say I don&#39;t veil criticism in niceties, but more to the point, I <br/>\ndon&#39;t see discussion of terms as criticism.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pamela Sorooshian","from":"Pamela Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] and so they eat","postDate":"1050081080","msgId":13472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlEMjgxMjAwLTZDNDAtMTFENy1BODZCLTAwMDM5M0FGNUEyRUBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEyZi4yN2EyZTk5Ni4yYmM4MzdkN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13471,"nextInTopic":13474,"prevInTime":13471,"nextInTime":13473,"topicId":13432,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"CONFERENCES really really did a lot for me.
