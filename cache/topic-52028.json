Take some photos of all of you at a museum or park or the <br/>\nbeach or something. Make recordings of them singing songs. My friend&#39;s <br/>\nson once made a video of himself playing nintendo - a game that he&#39;d <br/>\nreally mastered and he set up the videocamera to record him doing it. He <br/>\nplayed it for me, I&#39;m sure he played it for his grandparents, too. If <br/>\nyour kids are dressing up dolls or building with Lego or whatever they <br/>\nare doing - take photos and put them into albums to take to family <br/>\nget-togethers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf my in-laws were condescending toward us, I would probably not have <br/>\nnoticed because I was so busy thinking my own kids were so cool.

If you are going to allow other people to make you feel bad about <br/>\nthat, then you&#39;d better school the kids.

And that makes me and my husband happy, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very excited yesterday when my husband was talking to a friend about our unschooling.  He said it surprises him how much our kids know without school!!  We have always unschooled, but this was honestly the first time he had ever acknowledged that the kids were learning!  My oldest 10 yodd can&#39;t do math in her head, but my 7 yo ds can.  And our youngest 6 yo dd doesn&#39;t want to read yet; even though she could if she wanted to.  But they can play together and alone for hours; make toys from just sticks and rocks and have very active imaginations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe celebrate all their learning.  Following directions and building with Legos; performing surgery on stuffed animals; and dividing candy into thirds so they can all share.

Then as I got older, I was more confident (I&#39;d been taking care of myself for awhile by then, and was well-liked and respected by lots of people, and not having nay-sayers in m life had really helped) and was able to see them some, but not a lot, and with some boundaries drawn.

I&#39;m not sure if it has to do with confidence though.  It might be more about the way she figures things out, that she needs to be sure about it before she moves forward.  She may be experiencing thoughtfulness and caution rather than lack of confidence.  For kids like that, being around others who jump in without thinking it all through first might be part of the process.  If you can watch another try it out you are, in a way, learning what NOT to do.  When she does finally jump in, she&#39;ll probably do it just the way she wants to without hesitation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have doubts, go directly to your daughter.

It was like if I was a handicap.  Eventually I learned math on my own.  Any math I do I have to write it on a piece of paper because I get so nervous.  Like if people were judging me. I became extremely shy. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 5 years old I learned to read by myself.  I was able to read the newspaper and chapter books.  I was a happy kid!!!<br/>\nThen school came.  The first day of classes I concluded that going to school was a waste of time.  I hated school and got depressed and nervous. I tried to escape from the school many times but my parents forced me to go back to school.  I felt lonely in the classroom because I couldn&#39;t relate to the other kids.  <br/>\nMy family thought that there was something wrong with me because I wasn&#39;t happy in school.  Because of the stress I couldn&#39;t read anymore.  My hair was thinning and got athmas attacks. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 8 years old my mom would read me stories in the afternoon.  I would point to the words in the book while she was reading them.  That&#39;s how I learned to read again!!!! <br/>\nBecause of curiosity I started reading my sister&#39;s university books.  I thought they were more interesting than my third grade books.  People adviced my dad not to let me read university books. Because I was suppossed to be learning what kids my age were learning. I was told to read kids books. <br/>\nAgain I felt that there was something wrong with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I graduated from the University I worked in a public school.  It was like taking me back to the past. I kept asking myself, &quot;what are you doing here?&quot;  I had to quit my job.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI had my kid in a private day care and then in private Montessori school.  People were so impressed with her.  But she was not happy.  Every morning it was a fight to get her to go to school. She asked me many times to be her teacher. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am homeschooling my kid.  I have been making the same mistakes that my parents made with me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter seems to have a lack of confidence when she plays with her cousins.  The other day my mother-in-law told me that if I send my kid to school she will gain confidence.  We got into an argument and she was yelling at me, &quot;take her away from you and she will gain confidence.&quot;  It hurts. And it put more doubts in my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow can she learn to be confident if my husband and I do not have good self-esteem?<br/>\n<br/>\nI am ashamed about my past and about who I am.  But I need to stop running from my past and face it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAmy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51988,"nextTopicId":51780}}
