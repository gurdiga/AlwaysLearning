They accepted her with SAT scores and a brief letter from me saying that she was a homeschooler and would benefit from college-level classes (I basically repeated their verbiage). <br/>\nShe specifically chose this route because it maintains her eligibility for various financial aid and scholarship opportunities if she should want to attend college elsewhere in the future (she&#39;s only 14 now). She&#39;s limited to 6 credits a semester this way, and she can&#39;t get financial aid. However, in Kansas, they would have given her regular (degree-seeking) admission if I had written that she had &quot;graduated&quot; from our homeschool high school and she had submitted the same SAT scores. No transcript would have been required.<br/>\nFWIW, the SAT scores were, overall, above average for a high school senior, but not extraordinary. They only required that she score above the 50th percentile - an out of state student would have been required to submit slightly higher scores. She had never done any formal mathematics until she decided on this plan, and she spent about 2-3 months sporadically prepping for the SAT (mostly on math). <br/>\nDaron<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"College, transcripts and unschoolers","postDate":"1174251999","msgId":28204,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGV0azlrdis5NzJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28205,"prevInTime":28203,"nextInTime":28205,"topicId":28204,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Someone asked on a state-specific homeschooling list i m on: I have looked and looked and cannot find an answer to my question.

Or do we get to do what we want because we homeschool?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI responded:&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure we get to do what we want. Some <br/>\nhomeschooling parents make up a diploma for their child, give grades <br/>\netc. Since we don&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; in any way, shape, or form i don&#39;t <br/>\nplan on doing that unless my son requests it. I will ask him if he <br/>\nwants to take college classes when he&#39;s a teen, and will also offer <br/>\nhim the opportunity to take the GED if he so chooses.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone responded to my post with &quot;When and if your child wants to <br/>\ngo to college you will need a high school transcript with all the <br/>\nrequired credits in your school district. Even with a high school <br/>\ndiploma issued by you they will require a transcript. Find out what<br/>\nyour local school requires and go from there.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course i responded that i dont think all colleges have the exact <br/>\nsame requirements, and that they really just want to be able to <br/>\ncheck off a little box that they got the required form (such as a <br/>\ntranscript), that since my son is unschooled he does NOT HAVE a <br/>\ntranscript, and i dont think i would feel comfortable just making <br/>\none up with grades and such (since it would be a total fabrication)<br/>\nbut that i would be happy to write up an outline of the kinds of <br/>\nwork he&#39;s done, with appropriate &quot;subject&quot; designations if the need <br/>\nbe there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also pointed out that if someone takes a GED they dont have a <br/>\ntranscript for high school, if they didnt go, but they can still get <br/>\ninto college. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then it occurred to me that i dont actually have any experience <br/>\nin this situation, as my kid is only ten, but thought i would throw <br/>\nit out there to see what other unschoolers&#39; experiences were.
