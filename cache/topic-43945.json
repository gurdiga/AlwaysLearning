I never have quite bought all the<br/>\nharanguing about original sin as reflected in daily life.  Sure there&#39;s such<br/>\na thing as full-blown evil and a huge reason for that is the lack of love<br/>\nand integrity in the revolving door of generations of adults as they pass<br/>\nthrough with the jaded baton of distrust to give the next generation.

THAT&#39;S why your having such problems  <br/>\nwith<br/>\nyour children and they&#39;re so controlling of others.&quot; =-<br/>\n<br/>\nYears ago when my kids were about 2, 4, 7, thereabouts, there was a  <br/>\ncampout, a medium-sized SCA event WAY far from any town.  Nobody  <br/>\nbesides us would be anywhere near.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found a little canyon of sorts and declared it the &quot;kid area&quot; and  <br/>\ninvited other families with kids to camp there.  Keith set up a  <br/>\nplatform we had, kind of a 2&#39; high stage, for the kids to play on (so  <br/>\nthey could stay out of rocks and cactus that that).   We made a kids&#39;  <br/>\ncooler, with all foods they could eat easily, and drinks.  We had a  <br/>\nkids&#39; first aid kit.  We had toys that could pass for medieval toys.   <br/>\nWe had ribbons on wands and toy swords and other fun things.    <br/>\nSometimes the adults would be gone from camp for half an hour or an  <br/>\nhour, but the kids were set up to be fairly self-sufficient, and we  <br/>\nhad planned not to micromanage them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne family also had three kids; military family (same mom who wanted  <br/>\nto &quot;discuss our relationship&quot; a couple of years before that; they  <br/>\neventually moved back to Alabama).  Another family was more like my  <br/>\nkids, quieter, a little sullen, but not sneaky.<br/>\n<br/>\nA childless woman in our camp, friends of everyone there, girlfriend  <br/>\nof one of my husband&#39;s squires, took me for a walk Saturday night,  <br/>\nafter we&#39;d been there a day and a half.  We were on a dirt road in the  <br/>\ndarkest dark, in west central New Mexico, not a light for 30 miles  <br/>\nexcept the fires from the camps behind us.  That makes it easy to  <br/>\nremember that walk.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe apologized to me for having thought my kids were awful, because  <br/>\nshe said she had thought the other family&#39;s kids were great, but when  <br/>\nshe arrived in camp and went into her tent and could hear the kids  <br/>\ninteracting, she said our kids were just the same as they would have  <br/>\nbeen if Keith and I had been there, and the other family&#39;s kids were  <br/>\ntrying to persuade Kirby to do things they shouldn&#39;t and Kirby (one of  <br/>\nthe oldest) was saying no, we&#39;re not doing that, and managing the  <br/>\nwhole group and making sure the youngest kids were happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said if she ever had kids she was definitely going to come and  <br/>\ntalk to me about what we had done and how.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to babysit those other kids sometimes, and they were truly,  <br/>\ndeeply over-controlled.  And the dad would say &quot;I better not ever see  <br/>\nyou do that,&quot; and that&#39;s what he meant.  He was telling them in plain  <br/>\nEnglish that they could do it, as long as he didn&#39;t see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sympathized with them, and would let them go a little crazy at our  <br/>\nhouse, but they were girl/boy/girl and the boy was quick and strong  <br/>\nand desperate to make ANY decisions, to have ANY moment of personhood,  <br/>\nof respect, of the smile of an adult even when he wasn&#39;t kowtowing to  <br/>\nevery crazy &quot;because I said so&quot; demand.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had NO reasons on earth to &quot;be good,&quot; except to avoid his parents&#39;  <br/>\npunishments.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids had no reasons on earth to &quot;be bad.&quot;  It made no sense to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":385190857,"authorName":"Jimi Ann Vane","from":"Jimi Ann Vane &lt;jimi.jane@...&gt;","profile":"jannvane","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"trusting our children","postDate":"1239220243","msgId":43945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2MzgwY2QyMDkwNDA4MTI1MGwxNDZhYTExNHRmNDlhNzJjZjUzZGRiNmVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":43948,"prevInTime":43944,"nextInTime":43946,"topicId":43945,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have been thinking about something Pam mentioned in a post last week, about how it s difficult for some to get past the Christian teaching that children","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-927467923\">I have been thinking about something Pam mentioned in a post last week,<br/>\nabout how it&#39;s difficult for some to get past the &quot;Christian&quot; teaching that<br/>\nchildren all are born with a &quot;sin nature.&quot;  (I know you didn&#39;t word it like<br/>\nthat, but I can&#39;t seem to locate that post -- correct me if I&#39;m wrong.)  I<br/>\npersonally do not believe that children are born bad -- how we could we<br/>\nthink that of such a sweet, cuddly baby??  But I felt I still needed to<br/>\nclarify this more in my own thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve witnessed a family we know so distrust their children that the children<br/>\nnow do seem very dishonest, I believe partly because the parents never would<br/>\ntrust them to make wise choices on their own.  They&#39;re always looking to<br/>\n&quot;catch&quot; them misbehaving, and sure enough, as soon as the parents&#39; eyes look<br/>\nthe other way, here&#39;s their chance.  &quot;FINALLY Mom and Dad aren&#39;t looking!<br/>\nLet&#39;s give them what they expect!&quot;  They hover over those children like<br/>\neagles -- the Mom even admitted she&#39;d been watching MY daughter for two<br/>\nmonths!!  &quot;HEY!!  Get away, you!&quot; I felt like saying.  I did say something<br/>\nsimilar, but a little nicer.  :)  It made me feel really weird.  She went on<br/>\nto point out some ways she thought my daughter needed to pay more attention<br/>\nto her daughter, and the like.  I replied that I didn&#39;t think she needed to<br/>\nbe watched that closely -- she&#39;s almost 11 -- and we like to let her make<br/>\nher own decisions about who to play with, etc., as long as she&#39;s not<br/>\npurposely trying to exclude others at times when they&#39;re all together.  Very<br/>\ntouchy situation.  The children complain about this particular friend of my<br/>\ndaughter&#39;s, about her being so controlling and forceful.  Just like the<br/>\nmother.  I am seeing how destructive it can be, and how self-defeating the<br/>\nbehavior is.  The father said to us last night, &quot;If you let the children<br/>\nalone, they WILL misbehave.  I&#39;ve seen it myself.  We&#39;ve got to keep an eye<br/>\non the children at all times.&quot;  I just sat there with my mouth hanging open,<br/>\nthinking, &quot;Oohhh,  now I get it.  THAT&#39;S why your having such problems with<br/>\nyour children and they&#39;re so controlling of others.&quot;  (The father wanted to<br/>\nmeet with my family and another family to discuss why his daughter feels<br/>\nleft out of things when they get together.  The Mom sat there close to tears<br/>\nwondering why the other children avoid her daughter at times and why<br/>\neveryone doesn&#39;t embrace her).   Well, I kind of got off on that -- let me<br/>\nshare a quote from a John Holt book that about sums it up for me, before I<br/>\nconfuse myself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a quote from John Holt&#39;s book (I believe it&#39;s Patrick Farenga<br/>\nwriting), that sums it up so beautifully and helped me to understand it more<br/>\nfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;For instance, the observation that children are &quot;born kind&quot; is not the same<br/>\nas they&#39;re being born without need of any moral upbringing as they are<br/>\ninnately good.  In our office I heard John talk angrily about people who he<br/>\nfelt belonged in jail, who were just &quot;bad cats&quot; (John&#39;s phrase for such<br/>\npeople), and children who were willfully bad in some pretty awful ways.  He<br/>\ndidn&#39;t view all people as innately good; he didn&#39;t view all people as<br/>\ninnately bad, either.  He simply wanted us to recognize that there is a<br/>\ntendency toward kindness present in children to which they respond, and that<br/>\nworking with that tendency, rather than ignoring it, quashing it, or<br/>\ndistorting it, can make living and learning with children easier for us<br/>\nall.  The chances that good behavior, character, and morals will take root<br/>\nin an atmosphere of kindness are much better than if we assume the worst in<br/>\nchildren and use kindness only as a reward for good behavior, rather than<br/>\nthe norm for our relationships.&quot;  (Teach Your Own, p. 85)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great insight.
