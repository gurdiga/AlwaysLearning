What i was looking for though was uses of jelousy as a form of flattery, because I just dont get it. The majority of the time when i talk to the people in life,(with the exception of just a handfull of brilliant ispirining people i have the great fortune of conversing with occasionally)they allways respond to my dreams ambitions and accomplishments with &quot;Oh i&#39;m so jelous&quot;. Quite frankly i&#39;m getting tired of it. If you look at me, im not an outstanding and accomplished person, I am trying to be though and the energy of jealousy ( or so called )is not very inspiring. When i was growing up I did not have much, my shoes generally had holes in them, i had a few outfits that i had to keep clean and wear all the time and we only went on vacation twice as a family. I was abused with in the school system physically and sexually and just feel drained for the most part when i<br/>\n am complimented in the name of jelousy. I never harbored Jealousy despite for what seemed the lack of what i had, I think i grew to appreciate what i did have. Now it seems when jelousy in the form of a compliment is directed toward me its usually because i am doing somthing that they have allready done before and know how wonderfull it is, thats annoying. So whats the deal, do any of you use jealousy as a form of flattery and can enlighten me to its uses ? Is it really that common of a phrase or am i just associating with the wrong people. Or do I just need to suck it up becuase mostly everybody uses it and try to find some way to make it work for me ? <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed parents teaching children to be jealous when they admire somthing another child has and dont know exactly how to express the fact that they think they might enjoy having one of their own and may push or grab to get it. The parents swoop up the child and say somthing like &quot;why are you so jealous, be nice&quot; Thats annoying to watch. That happened recently and i tried to address the issue and got blown off. I dont even think my children know the word jealousy, although they are allways surprising me with things i had no idea they knew.<br/>\nAny takers ?

What i was looking for though was uses of jelousy as a form of flattery, because I just dont get it. The majority of the time when i talk to the people in life,(with the exception of just a handfull of brilliant ispirining people i have the great fortune of conversing with occasionally)they allways respond to my dreams ambitions and accomplishments with &quot;Oh i&#39;m so jelous&quot;. Quite frankly i&#39;m getting tired of it. If you look at me, im not an outstanding and accomplished person, I am trying to be though and the energy of jealousy ( or so called )is not very inspiring. When i was growing up I did not have much, my shoes generally had holes in them, i had a few outfits that i had to keep clean and wear all the time and we only went on vacation twice as a family. I was abused with in the school system physically and sexually and just feel drained for the most part when i am complimented in the name of jelousy. I never harbored Jealousy despite for what seemed the lack of what i had, I think i grew to appreciate what i did have. Now it seems when jelousy in the form of a compliment is directed toward me its usually because i am doing somthing that they have allready done before and know how wonderfull it is, thats annoying.  So whats the deal, do any of you use jealousy as a form of flattery and can enlighten me to its uses ? Is it really that common of a phrase or am i just associating with the wrong people. Or do I just need to suck it up becuase mostly everybody uses it and try to find some way to make it work for me ? <br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed parents teaching children to be jealous when they admire somthing another child has and dont know exactly how to express the fact that they think they might enjoy having one of their own and may push or grab to get it. The parents swoop up the child and say somthing like &quot;why are you so jealous, be nice&quot; Thats annoying to watch. That happened recently and i tried to address the issue and got blown off. I dont even think my children know the word jealousy, although they are allways surprising me with things i had no idea they knew.<br/>\n Any takers ? Does this bring to mind any thoughts for anyone?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":63316,"nextTopicId":63281}}
