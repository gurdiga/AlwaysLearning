I know you ask to wait and read before posting but I am in a situation where I need some answers now and I really don&#39;t have time to look and see if this has been posted before!-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe front page says this list isn&#39;t for discussing laws.  That should be done locally.  Find some people in North Carolina to talk to.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut no matter what they say, there are laws and you either need to have your kids in school or take an option the law allows.   Don&#39;t tell the state &quot;I don&#39;t need to follow your laws because I&#39;m unschooling.&quot;   Unschooling is a method of homeschooling just as The Open Classroom is a method of education, but someone who&#39;s going to run an open classroom school, or a &quot;freeschool,&quot; or any other sort of alternative school, needs to understand the laws well enough to describe what they&#39;re doing within those laws, and so does each unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe can&#39;t insert unschooling into a person the way we could sell them a refrigerator and come install it.  It&#39;s something the parents have to learn, gradually, and really understand.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re having any sort of dealings with officials of the government or school administration or hostile relatives, make more conservative choices until you&#39;re confident enough to describe what you&#39;re doing in the terms that fit the jurisdiction.  That&#39;s not the purpose of this discussion.  But the philosophical part that will apply anywhere is that there ARE laws, and either leaning toward or rushing fully toward unschooling doesn&#39;t change that fact.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are in a position to ignore some laws better than other people are.  But it&#39;s homeschooling (or private school, in California, or &quot;education otherwise&quot; or home education in England), and then, as a method, it might be unschooling, but that&#39;s not what you tell the state, because it&#39;s too particular.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy best analogy for this is if someone in North Carolina asks me where I live, I&#39;ll just say New Mexico.   If someone from Albuquerque asks me, I say near Juan Tabo and Candelaria.  If someone in Australia asks me, I say &quot;The U.S.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf another unschooler asks me, I say &quot;radical unschooling.&quot;  If I&#39;m talking to a stranger who knows nothing about homeschooling, I say &quot;homeschooling.&quot;   Unless they ask for more particulars, more particulars don&#39;t even make sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf someone from Australia says, &quot;Oh, I used to live in Albuquerque--up  near the mountains,&quot; then I can ask them where, and tell them how far from there my house is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have an intact marriage, friendly relatives and neighbors and you&#39;re not in any trouble with child services, then don&#39;t worry too much about laws.  If you do have legal entanglements, buying a curriculum might be a good idea  until you understand unschooling better. You don&#39;t have to use it exactly as is recommended, but you would have it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we can discuss this all in such a general way that it will help people in all different countries, I&#39;m willing to discuss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding out what local laws are and finding out how people in one&#39;s own country/state/district comply with those laws is part of the cost and reality of unschooling, and has to be done by each family.  If that&#39;s too difficult to do, then unschooling will be beyond their abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- they say I am not meeting the states requirement for subject content and time.
