My husband was away for about 12 hours each work day<br/>\nand it was eroding that connection we all had to and with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was painful for me to see that during the times he was at home with us,<br/>\nhe and the children were in conflict much of the time. it wasn&#39;t over what<br/>\nthey were learning -- it was about things like keeping their rooms tidy,<br/>\neating their dinners, not snacking before meals, going to bed at a<br/>\nparticular time -- and all of these (and other) things were to be done<br/>\nwithout &#39;talking back&#39; or questioning parental authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt had gotten to the point where the children and I were relaxed and happy<br/>\nwhen papa was away and tense and anxious when he was home. It was not a<br/>\ngood situation at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI brought a question here and got such awesome feedback. It helped me to<br/>\nsee that my husband&#39;s needs were not getting met and that I was setting up<br/>\na dynamic that encouraged the children to see papa as &#39;the problem.&#39;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat feedback helped me to sit and think and observe and make some changes.<br/>\nWe worked as a team, the children and I, to make our home a more peaceful<br/>\nplace so that when papa came home he was embraced in a loving &#39;nest&#39; and<br/>\nwelcomed there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI modeled being compassionate about my husband&#39;s need for a calm, tidy and<br/>\n(at least at times) peaceful home. The children and I had various, short<br/>\nconversations about how hard it was for papa to be away from home so much,<br/>\nknowing that he was missing out on the &#39;good stuff&#39; with them and how we<br/>\ncould rearrange things (physical and priorities) to help him participate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose were tiny changes in terms of effort and HUGE changes in terms of<br/>\noutcome. Having a more peaceful & tidy home kept papa&#39;s stress levels lower<br/>\nmeaning he was interacting with us instead of reacting to his own stress.<br/>\nGetting more of the &#39;daily life maintenance&#39; stuff taken care of (cooking,<br/>\ncleaning, etc.) while he was away meant that we had time and space for fun<br/>\nwhen papa was home.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was my responsibility, I finally understood to set up the best possible<br/>\nsituations for all of us. It was my responsibility to set the tone for how<br/>\nthe children viewed papa&#39;s involvement in our lives. Because falling into a<br/>\ndynamic where it was us vs. papa was bad for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur family is far stronger now for these changes. My husband is no longer<br/>\nthe outsider.

I&#39;ve brought up that it could perhaps be done in<br/>\n&gt; other ways, but got a shrug and usually something pertaining to, &quot;I want them to know how to listen to their boss someday&quot; or something else that makes me feel like we&#39;re just running in circles.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You could ask him how *he* learned to listen to his boss and whether he thinks it has served him well. You could talk about what he liked and didn&#39;t like about unquestioning obedience - not in a confrontational or manipulative way - but to find out his underlying thinking about the issues he has. These are things people don&#39;t talk about much before they have kids then, boom, all of a sudden mom and dad have completely different outlooks on how to approach life!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s fine to learn how to listen to your boss (even though good bosses usually want thinking employees, not yes-men), but you guys aren&#39;t their bosses. You&#39;re their parents who want to make the world of learning all manner of things available to them. Not only that, they might want to be the bosses instead and it would be advantageous to learn how to listen to their employees!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you started out with &quot;what a parent says goes&quot; and you&#39;ve changed to &quot;kids have a right to say &#39;no&#39; to any request, anytime&quot; too fast, then his resistance can pretty much be expected.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is getting frustrating because life is so different when he&#39;s at work--the kids are MUCH more likely to help out when I ask then, but as soon as he comes home things get tense.  And I feel awful because the kids tell me, &quot;We like you much better than Daddy.&quot; and that is the last thing I want!!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe you have inadvertently set this up by being the &quot;good guy&quot;. The tension probably is set by you. You&#39;re thinking &quot;oh, no - here comes a battle about something&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you could work with the kids to do something special for dad before he comes home. It might not have to be the &#39;menial task that builds character&#39; (whatever the heck that is). It could be something they initiate or agree on. Help them understand that a little effort can go a long way to calming the waters. They&#39;ll see that dad gets more relaxed and happy, which will be easier on them and you. And will it might make it easier for your husband to be more open to alternatives to the do-what-I-say model.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; At this point, I don&#39;t know what to do other than keep doing what I&#39;m doing??  We&#39;ve agreed that we don&#39;t agree but that we need to.  Ugh, I&#39;m tired of butting heads, but have no desire to take on such an authoritative role.  I would be extremely grateful for any input.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you might mean authoritarian. Being authoritative is a good thing - it means you&#39;re to be trusted and that you&#39;re reliable!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you&#39;re seeing you and your husband on opposite sides. You don&#39;t have to be, because you both want your kids to be happy and probably competent. You just have different understandings of how that&#39;s accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can bring him along gently as part of the team by doing what Sandra suggests &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch&quot;. Report to him by email or blog post or photos about what your kids are doing that he would like to see, plus other really cool stuff they do. He can&#39;t see it when he&#39;s at work and things are tense when he gets home. Keeping him in the loop can ease that tension for both of you, and for your kids. You will then become the authority in the house on how unschooling works. It&#39;s about learning all kinds of things, too, not just obedience to the person in the corner office! He&#39;ll trust you more when he see some results.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin B.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357463950,"authorName":"Trista Teeter","from":"Trista Teeter &lt;tristaleann@...&gt;","profile":"tristaleann@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"WAS My 4 year old son NOW Asking Questions","postDate":"1336966451","msgId":67133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzY5NjY0NTEuOTA3NDEuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjE2MjEwMi5tYWlsLmJmMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDJCRUQ2M0ZBLUU2ODItNEY4RC1CMzI1LTE0M0NFMTIwNDA0OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpvbzI4YStuOXQzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MDhBODdDQTMtNTQ4OS00QTBDLTk2QzEtQTM2QTZBM0M2OTlFQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8MkJFRDYzRkEtRTY4Mi00RjhELUIzMjUtMTQzQ0UxMjA0MDQ4QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":67130,"nextInTopic":67134,"prevInTime":67132,"nextInTime":67134,"topicId":67126,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"==I don t know what kind of questions you re asking him, but I have a guess (you don t need to confirm or deny; there are others here for whom it will be","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-880014463\">==I don&#39;t know what kind of questions you&#39;re asking him, but I have a <br/>\nguess (you don&#39;t need to confirm or deny; there are others here for whom it will be true).

So make sure he has some food available when he&#39;s liable to be hungry.  Especially if the smell of dinner cooking makes him realize he&#39;s hungry. At that point he might be way too hungry to eat something small. His body knows it needs a big chunk of calories so the Clif bar will look better than some crackers. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo put out a small plate of food that he likes earlier to stave off hunger.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don&#39;t want him grabbing Clif bars whenever he wants, put them up so he needs to ask. That way you can offer other options before giving him the Clif bar.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you forget to put out food, don&#39;t focus on the right answer being to get him to hold off for dinner. Give him choices. Let him know how soon dinner is. Let him know what dinner is. Give him options of food to choose from. Then let him choose. The choice he makes today won&#39;t be the choice he makes for the rest of his life. So he has a Clif bar instead of dinner one night. Or 10 nights. What will that matter in 10 years? Each time he makes a choice he&#39;ll be learning more about his needs, how his choice works with his need and more about himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  my son&#39;s demands have gotten steadily higher and higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It could be age.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be he feels like whether you&#39;ll meet a need is iffy so he needs to ask more often and more emphatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be he feels your stress and is reflecting it back in the way he asks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt could be he&#39;s going through something.

Be more peaceful with him. Maybe picture him as being in pain.

The first thing we did, when the waiter came to ask what drinks we wanted was to ask her to bring two slices of apple pie with the drinks.  Our friends made the expected noise about how the kids wouldn&#39;t eat anything else if they had pie first.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought was to keep the boys busy and happy and not hungry, so the adults could visit more peacefully, so I didn&#39;t really care whether they ate food later or not, but from my own knowledge of them, and experience, I was pretty sure they would.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the food came, they ate some of everything, especially the chicken strips, and so my friends were (easily) amazed.

I do know this is his age, but does anyone have any solutions or ways to &quot;be&quot; with a child who is, for lack of a better term, bossy with his parents?  Do I just go with this newfound bossiness, or do I talk to him about it somehow...he&#39;s at an age where he doesn&#39;t really hear me when I&#39;m trying to explain something to him -- he gets agitated and tells me to &quot;stop asking him questions&quot; when I talk about anything that he doesn&#39;t want to hear about...that&#39;s how I know I&#39;m annoying him, so I stop.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with the bossiness is his grabbiness (sorry for the words I keep making up...LOL).  If his sister has ANYTHING (including something of hers), he takes it.  I always intervene and try to help everyone have something they want, we work it out (and I always give his stuff back to him if she got a hold of it somehow)...but, the constant grabbing of stuff because he thinks whatever she has is better is getting out of hand.  It gets to the point, where he&#39;ll take something just to take it and put it up high where she can&#39;t get it (and then he doesn&#39;t even play with it or anything...and it&#39;s HER toy.)  Any suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for listening...just a tired mom with good intentions.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67099,"nextTopicId":67120}}
