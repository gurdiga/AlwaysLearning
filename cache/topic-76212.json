A couple years ago he save all the money he could, he would sold toys/things and even his sister gave him some money so he could &nbsp;build a decent gaming computer. We gave him some money that we could and he is still very happy about his computer.<div><br></div><div>A couple months ago I gave him a new heat sink fan so he could overclock his CPU .</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes he uses his money for buying games.</div><div>He bought a new PS4 by selling his PS3 and adding some money he saved/was gifted &nbsp;to it. Those are all big purchases we just cannot afford.</div><div><br></div><div>Now I do give him games. His sister used to do horseback riding and piano lessons for about $200 a month so when my son asked for a game I gave him. Why would one be more important than the other? He is learning so much gaming and he is happy and joyful.</div><div>I think video games are wonderful and they are his passion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He is very conscientious about sales , prices, deals and so on. He looks for all of it before making a decision.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A couple weeks ago my husband and daughter went to the World Dairy &nbsp;Expo for 2 days and my son did a lot of farm chores so they could go.</div><div>Every night he also feeds heifers and does farm chores to help his dad. The farm just gave him his first pay and he has it sitting in his drawer. He has been wanting to upgrade his video cad and now he can! But he is sitting on it and still thinking about it.&nbsp;</div><div>He was actually surprised with the money and told me his dad had just given him those crisp 100 dollar bills. He did not realize they were for paying him to help.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am amazed at him sometimes. All the thought he puts into purchases. More and more he is so much more careful with money and mindful of buying then I was at his age and I was never a big spender.</div><div><br></div><div>When he was young we were making more money and I used to buy him presents everyday if he wanted! He has 51 Thomas the Tank Engines and that is only counting the wood ones and not counting the cars&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He was the child I gave everything I could when he asked. Sure what he likes now are much more expensive than toys :)</div><div><br></div><div>Both my kids have declined me buying them something! That is amazing. What child turns down a toy?</div><div><br></div><div>When my daughter was little things were different with the economy and our farm . She loved to buy and buy and our budged was nonexistent !</div><div><br></div><div>I still found ways to buy her tons of the toys she loved. Thrift stores, Craigslist, yard sales , eBay.</div><div>She was searching eBay as young as 4 on her own.</div><div><br></div><div>Thursdays were 50% off out local Goodwill thrift store for kid&#39;s toys and clothes.&nbsp;</div><div>I found lots of dress up clothes for her for nothing and we would have maybe 2 or 5 dollars and we would fill up the cart with what she wanted and then pick what she wanted the most up to how much we had. She got to decide if those Barbies were going home or the My LiTtle Pony !&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That made her feel abundance and joy to get many toys .</div><div>Our huge collection of plush toys yielded so much joy and pretend play for both my kids! All for very little money!</div><div><br></div><div>My daughter &nbsp;is as good with money as her brother is and they had very different experiences.&nbsp;</div><div>What they had in common was feeling abundance, generous parents and knowing that if we could not get them something they really wanted right away we would try hard to find a way to, be buying used, saving, deals .&nbsp;</div><div>Both my kids will research something they want and look for prices, &nbsp;deals, sales, and other ways to be able to make the best purchase.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My daughter also saved this year for a big purchase! She bought a Jersey Heifer calf on a sale.</div><div>That was way more than the PS 4 my son bought but she has been doing chores at the farm way longer. She does it because she likes it and would do it anyway. She does like to have her money.</div><div><br></div><div>This year she is no longer an Unschooler but my son is.

I’m so happy my kids had money to practice with, growing up.  <br/>\nSome of it is very likely genetic, too.  My husband is very careful with money, and all three of my kids are more careful than I am, not from talking about it, but from having certain personality traits, I think.  YES, practice helps, and maturity helps and it’s great to be able to ask others for advice.  <br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the worst thing would be false paucity—for a parent to withhold money the child knows about, just to do it.  Best to keep money separate and not let them know that you have some that they can’t have any of, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few families, years back, went too far with this partnership and choices, to say that their children had as much say over how money was spent as anyone else in the family.  That seems wrong, and dangerous, and something the parents should never have offered.  Children might not care anything about retirement funds or insurance.  Most people in their 20’s have a hard time caring.  :-)   <br/>\n<br/>\nParents have a duty and responsibility involving shelter, food, clothing, health care.  Children shouldn’t even know about those costs, when they’re little.  Let them play!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut learning in their own way, gradually, without pressure or fear, seems guaranteed to be beneficial for the future when numbers are larger and they’re the senior partners in some relationship, rather than the junior partner.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Earning money","postDate":"1444914811","msgId":76233,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l5cjdOV1FvLS1Lbll5WTVLd2t1WE94TDk2MUJVMWJGZ040dFI1YjNFRnk2UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU0M0FFMjc5LUVCQzMtNDg2Ny1CMkRDLTk1OEJDNDBFMTA5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0NDQ2ODkzODguMjkxMTE5ODAyQGYxMy5teS5jb20+CTxtdm5vNGcrcjN0djY0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPEU0M0FFMjc5LUVCQzMtNDg2Ny1CMkRDLTk1OEJDNDBFMTA5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":76229,"nextInTopic":76234,"prevInTime":76232,"nextInTime":76234,"topicId":76212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We manage money poorly.

He enjoys setting a goal for himself, working hard and then getting his reward.  It makes him feel capable and powerful.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething interesting happened, over the years, with our three kids who are now in their 20’s.  We didn’t decide to treat them the same, or keep tallies on what had been spent where.  Some birthdays or Christmasses, one got a big-deal gift, and others didn’t.  When they were old enough to know the prices of things, I would usually speak to the other two and say “Holly’s getting this thing, because…. [she needs it, or she didn’t get anything big for her birthday, or whatever].&quot;  They understood that another time it might be one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe’ve paid for travel, or assisted, in varying degrees.  Holly’s been internationally.  Kirby, just to a few conventions in neighboring states.  Marty, to some conferences, to visit other families, and we paid for his honeymoon to Puerto Rico.   Because from early ages they knew we were paying attention to what each, as an individual liked and needed and wanted, they never complained that in one season or one year things seemed imbalanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Kirby moved to Texas at barely 21, he wanted to do things on his own.  When his roommate and he didn’t have enough for utilities deposits because the company hadn’t yet reimbursed their travel claim, he borrowed $500 and paid it back within two weeks.  We would’ve given it to him, but he wanted to pay it back.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was driving a car he had been been given when his uncle died, and when he wanted to get a newer car on his own, we again offered to help him.  He wanted to take his own loan, though.  He recently paid it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently, he’s buying a house.  His dad made him a 2% loan for the down payment, and they have a one-year lease-to-buy, at the end of which they’ll get a mortgage for the remainder.   We could help more, but Kirby wants to do it with Destiny, so that it’s really truly THEIR house.  Makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly had a $600 pre-long-trip car service last week and asked her dad to pay half.  He just did. :-)  She hasn’t asked for money for a long time, and so when she asked, he helped.  She was helping someone move to Oregon, for $500, and didn’t like the idea of spending MORE than that to get the truck ready for the journey.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they were little, we helped if they needed it.  Now, if any of them really needed help and asked, we would help even if we needed to take a loan ourselves.  Gradually, after many years of small practice, a few disappointments, some goofs, they had real experience and good memories by the time they were using money they earned for “adult” things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":443923164,"authorName":"Cass Kotrba","from":"Cass Kotrba &lt;caskot@...&gt;","profile":"cass.kotrba","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Earning money","postDate":"1444831452","msgId":76220,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENPTDEzMC1XODczRDU0RTJDRDA3MTE0OTI1NTcxQ0M0M0YwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l6LS1uQ1owYlZYbngrT3ZWTlRTazdrRV8xMXZrZmhQRHNiUjR1bnBXLXBEQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0NDQ2ODkzODguMjkxMTE5ODAyQGYxMy5teS5jb20+LDwzMDg5NjQzOS0zQTY3LTQwMTMtQTM3NS1CMjhCREQyOTk1MUVAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+LDxDQVB2K2NZei0tbkNaMGJWWG54K092Vk5UU2s3a0VfMTF2a2ZoUERzYlI0dW5wVy1wREFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76219,"nextInTopic":76221,"prevInTime":76219,"nextInTime":76221,"topicId":76212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But after thinking about it more I am wondering if his request for earning money was because he truly enjoys buying things with HIS money-=- This is timely","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-857238154\"><html>\n<head>\n<style><!--\n#ygrps-yiv-857238154 .ygrps-yiv-857238154hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;padding:0px;}\n#ygrps-yiv-857238154 .ygrps-yiv-857238154hmmessage\n{\nfont-size:12pt;font-family:Calibri;}\n--></style></head>\n<div dir='ltr'>-=-<span style=\"color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">But after thinking about it more I am wondering if his request for earning money was because he truly enjoys buying things with HIS money-=-</span><div><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\">This is timely for me because my 11 year old son spent quite a bit of time helping me with projects yesterday in exchange for money. &nbsp;He is saving up for the new Guitar Hero. &nbsp;He didn&#39;t ask me to buy it for him. &nbsp;The game is released on Oct. 20 and he has figured out how much money he needs to make per day in order to reach $100.</span></font></div><div><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\">A couple of years ago he came up with the idea of earning money and saving it for large purchases on his own. &nbsp;It&#39;s something that he does about 2-3 a year. &nbsp;Once I offered to just give him the money and it made him sad. &nbsp;He enjoys setting a goal for himself, working hard and then getting his reward. &nbsp;It makes him feel capable and powerful. &nbsp;Often, when he wants something he will ask for something and I will get it if I can. &nbsp;Other times he asks me for jobs he can do to earn the money. &nbsp;</span></font><span style=\"color:rgb(68, 68, 68);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\">He truly does enjoy buying things with his own money. &nbsp;I think that it is a good experience for him to practice making his own money and saving up for things but that&#39;s not the main reason why I agree to it. &nbsp;I like seeing the feelings of pride and accomplishment on his face.</span></div><div><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\"><br></span></font></div><div><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Georgia\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;line-height:15.86px;\">When this first started I had some similar thoughts of &quot;Does this mean he won&#39;t help me with things simply because he wants to?

about $150 on her and then I started getting cranky. &nbsp;I was totaling up the costs while she was drooling over more stuff and that ended up with 2 cranky girls! &nbsp;On the way home we talked about why each of us got cranky and agreed we need a plan for next year. &nbsp;We decided that next year Dad &amp; I will give each kid a chunk of money to spend. &nbsp;I will also remind them that the event is coming up as it gets closer so that they can save up money of their own. &nbsp;Each kid will have their own money when we go in next year and will be in control of what they want to spend it on. &nbsp;Dad &amp; I will be there to support them &amp; help carry the packages. &nbsp;:D &nbsp;When their money is gone, it&#39;s gone. &nbsp;We are also planning to focus more on the costumes and events being offered in addition to the giant shopping spree. &nbsp;We think this is a good plan and are hoping to have a blast next year.</span></font></div><div><font color=\"#444444\"

My 5 yo LOVES to get paid for work, so I do, the same way I would pay for something if he set up a store. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But, and this seems big to me right now, I *know* my kids worry about money when I worry about money. I&#39;m worried about money right now, and I can hear it in their comments. I am putting a lot of effort and attention to that problem *in myself*, to seeing the abundance. I got them excited about a karate program that I&#39;m concerned we can&#39;t afford (I thought there would be financial support from a family member but I was mistaken). So I sat down with the budget and I found the money, and I told my husband that we wouldn&#39;t have resources for other extras this year, and we were both comfortable with that. Feeling confident that I know what I can and can&#39;t afford makes it easier to be honest with the kids about what we can get now and what we can put on the wishlist. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I also am making sure that I&#39;m honest with myself about whether I really need something. I just bought concert tickets to my favorite band. They were $200. I&#39;ll find money for karate-it&#39;s more important than that concert. And the next time the band comes through town, maybe I&#39;ll pass it up, or ask for the tickets as a birthday present, or something. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I guess my point it that the way *I* feel about money is going to manifest all over the place, so if I don&#39;t want my kids to grow up being obsessed with it in the way I was, I have to fix that in myself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sarah</p></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Earning money","postDate":"1444748442","msgId":76216,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVEQjg4RDE3LUZEQkItNEY3MC04MkY4LThCQjI3QTZGNEJDRkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG12aXB0aisxMXJtaWp0QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDE0NDQ2ODkzODguMjkxMTE5ODAyQGYxMy5teS5jb20+IDwzMDg5NjQzOS0zQTY3LTQwMTMtQTM3NS1CMjhCREQyOTk1MUVAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+IDxtdmlwdGorMTFybWlqdEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":76215,"nextInTopic":76217,"prevInTime":76215,"nextInTime":76217,"topicId":76212,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m also a little worried about breaking the rules ;-)-=- The questions seemed about rules, too, with “battle” and “consequences” and “a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-557259289\">-=-I&#39;m also a little worried about breaking the rules ;-)-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe questions seemed about rules, too, with “battle” and “consequences” and “a fortune.”<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of looking at rules (what, when, where, who), look at principles (why):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you understand WHY there are things parents should buy for unschooled children, and why they might want to also, separately, provide money for the child to manage in his own way, you will be able to help other unschoolers, and not worry about breaking rules in a discussion.   <br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing WHY there are guidelines will make the guidelines themselves unnecessary.

That didn&#39;t happen despite me asking him whenever he spend money on gems, crystals, or other online faux online goods. The in-app purchases are such a clever idea that suck youngsters in. And of course at 10/11 years old, the immediate reward feels a lot larger than the potential greater reward some time in the fairly distant future.</div><div><br></div><div>So I ended up buying a new mouse, several packs of Pokemon cards, a mousepad, Pokeman card sleeves and storage boxes etc etc. Eventually I started saying no. But knowing this group, and what I am trying to do with unschooling, I was uncomfortable saying no. On the other hand the requests and costs were escalating like crazy.</div><div><br></div><div>Bear in mind I paid $300 for tickets worth $80 because they were sold out in minutes when they went on sale and I know my son is obsessed with gaming so this was something I wanted to make happen at any cost.</div><div><br></div><div>We also had to travel to the expo, about 400 miles, at more expense (stayed with family so no costs there).</div><div><br></div><div>So my question.</div><div><br></div><div>Should I be increasing the allowance significantly, advising saving when I know there are future events at which they are going to want money, and then letting the consequences play out when the events come and they have no money?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My instinct is to give them enough monthly allowance that spending now and saving for future large purchases are both practical, and then letting them completely decide how to spend their money but also letting them deal with the consequences when there is no money when these events come up.</div><div><br></div><div>Surely part of unschooling and learning is that children need to be allowed how to spend their money as they wish, but also then need to learn the consequences and not learn&nbsp;they can spend all their money and then I will dish out more when needed because they have no savings?</div><div><br></div><div>What we have been doing is kind of a hybrid, and my instinct says its the worst of both worlds. We give a fair amount of allowance, but probably not enough for regular spending and putting aside some savings. Then we encourage them not to spend it all and to save some for later purchases. Then we usually give out more money when those opportunities like gaming conventions come around, but not as much as they like, and we are in control of yes/no on purchases. They plead and we either cave in or say no and both parties feel bad.</div><div><br></div><div>So we (adults) end up being in a position of power, and if we just provide more money then consequences are not learned.</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;ve rambled on a so I&#39;ll leave my thoughts there for now. I would be very interested in feedback.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks</div><div>Richard</div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1182879953ygroups-quoted\"><br><br>---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote :<br><br><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1182879953ygrps-yiv-1455475023\">My collection of older writings about allowance and spending money are here:<br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/money\">http://sandradodd.com/money</a><br>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/math/allowance\">http://sandradodd.com/math/allowance</a><br>\n<br>You might also search the archives of this group.

We all chime in if things need to be done. My husband and I will ask my son to help - sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#39;t help which has never been an issue.</div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-971522532ygrps-yiv-761066495composeWebView_editable_content\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><br><div>About a year ago my son asked to have some allowance money. He sometimes spends it right away on little things and sometimes saves up for bigger items. It is entirely up to him how to spend it but he will ask me for help with calculating how much more he needs to safe for a certain purchase. </div><div><br></div><div>There is no real separation of what we buy for him and what he buys for himself. It&#39;s more like if he saved the money he will buy it himself and if he does&#39;t have the money and our budget allows it we will pay for it. There have been some really good discussions around money because of his allowance like trying to find the cheapest way of buying something so we can buy more for the same amount of money. </div><div><br></div><div>My son asked me yesterday if he could do chores around the house for money - I think he got the idea from his cousin who is payed for chores and good grades in school. </div><div><br></div><div>I didn&#39;t say anything because I didn&#39;t know what to say...... ;)</div><div><br></div><div>I really don&#39;t want to pay him for help around the house. My husband and I certainly don&#39;t pay each other for chores - we don&#39;t even really have a list of chores. In general everyone does the things he likes the best, does the best or whatever needs to be done the most at this time. I would like to keep our home a place where family members do things for each other because they like to contribute to the family and not because it is a payed chore. It seems to me the &quot;what is in for me&quot; attitude is plentiful around and I don&#39;t feel it fits in well with unschooling principles.</div><div><br></div><div>But after thinking about it more I am wondering if his request for earning money was because he truly enjoys buying things with HIS money.  Maybe I&#39;m keeping him from learning about how to earn money ? Maybe I&#39;m standing in the way of his discovery of the business world ? I can&#39;t think of a lot of things he could do to earn money outside the family at the age of 7 though.</div><div><br></div><div>How have others handled this issue ? </div><div><br></div><div>Thank you !</div><div><br></div><div>Sabine </div><div><br></div><div>Sent from myMail for iOS<br>    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-971522532ygrps-yiv-761066495composeWebView_previouse_content\"></div></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":76222,"nextTopicId":76237}}
