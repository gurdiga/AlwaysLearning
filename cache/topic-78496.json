He is 12yo, always unschooled, and so far has no interest in school. But for my childhood, my brother and I were required to go to school, and that was the extent of my parent’s interest. We were late quite often, and they never cared. They never had any interest in our homework and not any real interest in grades. I was a “good” student and got high marks. My brother wasn’t, but I don’t remember them making an issue out of it. One clear memory I have is when I was in late high school and cut classes one day (it was a spontaneous decision to do something more fun with friends) - I overheard the school call later that night, and my dad answered. His words were to the effect of: “You can’t even pronounce her name right, so I know you don’t know her, and don’t care about her. You just want your funding. I don’t give a **** about your funding. If she took a day off, maybe she just needed a day off.” I have a lot of bad memories of my father, but that’s one of the good ones! I always knew that if I needed a day off from school, or just wanted one, they’d get it “excused”. This was just one time where I hadn’t planned ahead.<div class=\"ygrps-yiv-655996575\"><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-655996575\"></div><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-655996575\">There were a lot of issues we had in our childhoods…but one of the areas I feel my parents got right was they never made us feel that the school was more important than us. They saw it as an institution that offered us some things better than they could do for us at home. But they never let it rule our lives. I credit that upbringing for making it easier for me to understand unschooling. My husband’s parents were much like mine, too.

No longer were these children in school against their will, their parents having submitted them to a lock-up situation. On one hand they had teachers who wanted them to stay in school. On the other hand they had parents who wanted them to stay home. How much more “wanted” could they feel? Each moment they were in school they were aware, and the teacher was aware, that they were there because they, the children, WANTED to be there! These factors changed the way the kids responded to assignments, to interpersonal problems, and to threats from the teacher (which have little power without the backing of the parents.) <br/>\n. . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough the ideal might be children who have never gone to school a day in their lives, reality isn’t always ideal. If your children press you to let them go to school, this detachment option might be a way for you to have your cake and eat it too. The philosophies of choice, freedom, child-led learning, “bliss-led learning,” and personal responsibility can be honored and spread to new audiences by parents treating children as humans with rights and responsibilities whether they are sixteen, twelve, or eight years old.<br/>\n____________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":545877370,"authorName":"Megan Valnes","from":"Megan Valnes &lt;meganvalnes@...&gt;","profile":"pjlzslove","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Using principles to guide children who choose school","postDate":"1540566617","msgId":78498,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQ00tMVlYSmpMT1g4Y1ZRRngwa042N3JKaGotRkFkNUZCczhSclRVXzBEYm44eDJCUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBR01NRjhuTktnOWFkeW4tWkhvcGF1Q1hwWXVmdytFOFU1YVMyYTktS3ZqWWpuSFJ6UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBR01NRjhuTktnOWFkeW4tWkhvcGF1Q1hwWXVmdytFOFU1YVMyYTktS3ZqWWpuSFJ6UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78497,"nextInTopic":78499,"prevInTime":78497,"nextInTime":78499,"topicId":78496,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My son is 14 and also decided to go to high school this year after 5 years of unschooling.

I never see him studying, but we do talk about the different books he’s been reading for English class. His top priority for going to school seems to be a connected social life, which he is achieving. He’s made many friends and seems to be having a lot of fun during his hours away! School is 100% his choice and I will support him however he needs. I’m expecting some low grades on his report card because I know he’s missed some big projects and, like I said, he doesn’t study. How society expects me to react to his low grades or tardies means nothing to me. The school has its own consequences (punishments) for transgressions against their rules and my son understands that. He also knows that he won’t suffer any consequences at home for what he does or doesn’t do in school (with the exception of hurting another person, which is not his thing at all, so I’m not worried). Home is still a safe place. If he chooses to not study and get bad grades, then his report card will reflect that and we can go from there. I have offered to help him, but he turns me down, and seems very comfortable on his own. I choose to approach this as an unschooling parent: communication, understanding, and appropriate expectations are paramount. His happiness is my meter and right now, he’s flying high. </div><div><br><blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> <div class=\"ygrps-yiv-1776196428gmail_quote\"><div dir=\"ltr\">On Wed, Oct 24, 2018 at 19:44 Sherry Franklin <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sherryfranklin150@...\">sherryfranklin150@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class=\"ygrps-yiv-1776196428gmail_quote\" style=\"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;\">\n\n\n<u></u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n<div style=\"background-color:#fff;\">\n<span style=\"display:none;\"> </span>\n\n\n<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1776196428m_3255940739018197053ygrp-mlmsg\">\n  <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1776196428m_3255940739018197053ygrp-msg\">\n\n\n    <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1776196428m_3255940739018197053ygrp-text\">\n      \n      \n      <p>Hello,</p><div><br></div><div>My children have been unschooled since the end of second grade for the past six years.  We lived abroad during that time.  Our kids are now both 14 and asked to go to high school.  We moved back to the states for that express purpose and they entered high school in North Carolina.  The first week or so was a bit rocky, but they have really exceeded all of their own expectations.  My daughter is thriving academically and has made friends.  She is normally more introverted.  My son has struggled a bit with the academics, but his social life is very full, which is what he was hoping for.  </div><div><br></div><div>Today my son skipped a class.  I received a call from the school.  I need some guidance as to how unschooling principles can guide my actions and reactions in this type of a situation.  I was very upset at first.  After some reflection I believe that he should meet whatever consequences the school gives.  I am still an unschooling parent with unschooled kids choosing to go to school, and yet this has thrown me mentally and emotionally.  I know what society would have me do...take away all electronics and probably a grounding, and while that felt really good to think about it also made me feel a horrible sense of helplessness and depression.  </div><div><br></div><div>If anyone can help me walk myself through this I would appreciate it.  My son is a very open child and is talking to me about this.  I am grateful for that.  He feels terribly. </div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards, </div><div><br></div><div>Sherry </div><div><br></div><div><br></div>\n<p></p>\n\n    </div>\n     \n\n    \n    <div style=\"color:#fff;height:0;\"></div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div></div></blockquote></div></span></blockquote></div>-- <br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-1776196428gmail_signature\">With love,<br>Megan<br><br><br>P.s.🌟Life is supposed to be Fun🌟<br></div>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Using principles to guide children who choose school","postDate":"1540436149","msgId":78497,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI3RDY2OEE1LTc5RDMtNDU4OS05Q0FGLUYzMTZFOUU0Q0NCOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBR01NRjhuTktnOWFkeW4tWkhvcGF1Q1hwWXVmdytFOFU1YVMyYTktS3ZqWWpuSFJ6UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBR01NRjhuTktnOWFkeW4tWkhvcGF1Q1hwWXVmdytFOFU1YVMyYTktS3ZqWWpuSFJ6UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":78496,"nextInTopic":78498,"prevInTime":78496,"nextInTime":78498,"topicId":78496,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I need some guidance as to how unschooling principles can guide my actions and reactions in this type of a situation.-=- He’s making his own choices.
