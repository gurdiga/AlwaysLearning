Keep a learning log for a while, <br/>\nand show it to him when he asks.

When the time came, there <br/>\nwas no need for discussion, and I continued <br/>\nhomeschooling.  This was almost 13 years ago, <br/>\nby the way, when homeschooling was still pretty <br/>\nrare.  We started with school at home, but <br/>\ngradually went more and more toward unschooling <br/>\nas I read John Holt&#39;s works and met other <br/>\nunschoolers.
