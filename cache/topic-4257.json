I did not think it was too long at<br/>\nall, as I was fascinated all the way through.  :-) <br/>\nYour story is SO radically different than my own path<br/>\nto Unschooling that it was really a great learning<br/>\nexperience for me.  I am not accustomed to believing<br/>\npeople think that way.  I guess no matter how hard we<br/>\ntry, we do really assume that other folks are similar<br/>\nto us.  I knew that not everyone came to Unschooling<br/>\nthe same way, but your story was a real illustration<br/>\nof how opposite those paths can be that lead to the<br/>\nsame destination.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found my way to Unschooling as a teenager, in my<br/>\nquest to educate myself and escape from the<br/>\ninstitutions.  I had to fight against a lot of<br/>\nenormous odds for my right to be in charge of my own<br/>\neducation, my parents being one of my biggest<br/>\nobstacles.  I finally had enough information, strength<br/>\nof will, and ability to access and utilize options<br/>\nwhen I was a teen starting highschool to be able to<br/>\neffect my escape from school.  Oh how I wish the<br/>\nTeenage Liberation handbook had been in print then, or<br/>\nthat I had discovered John Holt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always known I WANTED children, and had spent<br/>\nmost of my life in various positions of caring for<br/>\nother people&#39;s children before I had my own.<br/>\nI decided that I would not subject my own children to<br/>\nwhat I had to endure in the city schools.  I decided<br/>\nto homeschool my own children before I ever had any,<br/>\nbefore I found their daddy.  :-)  <br/>\nI began to explore homeschooling options and<br/>\nlegalities when my first son was an infant and<br/>\ndiscovered that there was a name for what I had done<br/>\nwith myself as a teenager, Unschooling!  It felt like<br/>\ncoming home to find the Unschooling community.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am still working my way through all the books about<br/>\nUnschooling, homeschooling, education and parenting<br/>\nthat I want to read.  Somehow two VERY active boys are<br/>\nnot conducive to my own desired reading list<br/>\nshrinking, and Unschooling has a way of making my<br/>\nreading list keep growing and growing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thank you for your story.  It really helps me<br/>\nto understand where some people may be coming from.  I<br/>\ngrew up on San Francisco and environs (Sausalito, Palo<br/>\nAlto, Mountain View, Santa Cruz, San Lorenzo Valley<br/>\nand kids who grew up on the communes there, and etc)<br/>\nand while I was exposed to a huge variety of<br/>\nlifestyles, values and diverse folks, it&#39;s been an<br/>\neducation process since I moved away from California<br/>\nwhat types of folks I did NOT get exposure to.  I did<br/>\nnot get a lot of exposure to things like close<br/>\nmindedness, conservativism, circular and dead end<br/>\nthinking, bigotry and prejudice.  I KNEW about such<br/>\nthings, but thought they were the exception, not the<br/>\nmajority.  I was in for a great culture shock when I<br/>\nmoved, and I continue to encounter attitudes which<br/>\nstartle or surprise me.  Particularly because I am the<br/>\nantithesis of those things and am very joyfully honest<br/>\nabout being a Pagan-Unschooling-Attachment<br/>\nParenting-Intentional Communitarian-and Etc....  Some<br/>\npeople find me REALLY offensive, just for being me.  I<br/>\nam sure everyone on this list knows what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad to know that being on opposite spectrums<br/>\nabout some things does not prevent us from<br/>\ncommunicating and learning from each other, as is so<br/>\noften the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE Valentine eCards with Yahoo!
