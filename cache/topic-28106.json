I just want to know if there is a way  <br/>\nto help her inner light glow stronger so that she can find a way out  <br/>\nof the &quot;victim&quot; role.  I think the essence is her fear of making  <br/>\nmistakes and displeasing others, especially her sister, so she gives  <br/>\nin even though she wants something else.

I have found that  <br/>\ninstead of ignoring the &quot;offender&quot;, they are the child who needs my  <br/>\nattention most.  I try my best to remember that they are in pain and  <br/>\nalways presume positive intent (i.e. of course do not want to hurt  <br/>\ntheir sibling, but just simply cannot control themselves sometimes,  <br/>\nbeing a little kid and all).  So, one thing that has really helped  <br/>\nis, when I hear a fight happening and I come upon the kids, I  <br/>\nimmediately apologize to the &quot;offender&quot;, I say &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m really  <br/>\nsorry I didn&#39;t get here in time&quot; and &quot;looks like you needed my help&quot;,  <br/>\nand then I help mediate the conflict, respectfully.  Another thing  <br/>\nthat helps is family meetings, sometimes daily, where each of us talk  <br/>\nabout our *problems*, *plans*, and *sharing* (make three columns on a  <br/>\nbig dry erase board) we get a lot of problems worked out that way,  <br/>\nwhen the emotions are NOT high, and make agreements that we can refer  <br/>\nback to when in the thick of disagreements.  Other things that have  <br/>\nworked were creating more space for &quot;special time&quot; with each child,  <br/>\n10-15 minutes a day, each.  Also, we parents are so relieved to have  <br/>\nthings going well between our children that we sometimes don&#39;t notice  <br/>\nthe details of the generous and flexible moments between them. If you  <br/>\nlook carefully, I think you&#39;ll see sharing, assistance, and  <br/>\nthoughtfulness at moments and in places you hadn&#39;t noticed before,  <br/>\nand your noticing of those times will only create more!  Also, all of  <br/>\nthe kids know that they can call out &quot;mama! problem!&quot; when they have  <br/>\nan issue they don&#39;t feel they can take care of peacefully on their  <br/>\nown - even my teenager will use this code word he has always known if  <br/>\nhe gets into a situation with the youngers (they wouldn&#39;t leave his  <br/>\nroom last night and he was really tired and starting to feel mad), so  <br/>\nit helps both the &quot;victim&quot; and the &quot;offender&quot; (not that we use ever  <br/>\nthose labels either, this is just for clarification of this post)  <br/>\nfeel empowered to feel safe in their home and not have the burden of  <br/>\nsolving every problem themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmily<br/>\n<br/>\njoyfully unschooling<br/>\nin Portland, Oregon<br/>\nwith dh Michael<br/>\nds Morgan (12/91)<br/>\nds Seth (8/99)<br/>\ndd Sara Kate (7/01)<br/>\nand ds Jacob (12/04)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been noticing a &quot;poor me&quot; increase with one of my girls.
