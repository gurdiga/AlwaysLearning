I was never hit and<br/>\nscolded very rarely, and those moments I can still remember. One was when I<br/>\nwas very young. It was summer holidays, and I went out to play in the<br/>\nmorning, and went over to my best friend&#39;s house to watch cartoons or<br/>\nsomething because the idea came up. Had lunch there. Around tea time, a<br/>\nfrantic grandmother arrived there after having searched the entire vicinity<br/>\nand asked at the homes of other friends (no phone). She was so relieved when<br/>\nshe saw me, and was almost in tears. Her &quot;scolding&quot; was &quot;Do NOT go without<br/>\ntelling where and when you are coming back&quot;. I never had to be told again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she became old, and I went to stay with my parents, the habit stuck. My<br/>\ndad was verbally abusive, and our relationship was bad, but I still used to<br/>\ninform (rather arrogantly at times). I didn&#39;t lie because he was so awful to<br/>\nme anyway, what did it matter what he thought of me? So it could be &quot;Going<br/>\nout. Back by 2am&quot;. &quot;Where?&quot; - &quot;On the corner, chatting with friends.&quot; &quot;Why<br/>\nso late?&quot; - &quot;I like the night. Its less crowded. More space.&quot; However, I was<br/>\nalways back before the stated time and told him that if I wasn&#39;t back by<br/>\nwhatever time I said, to go ahead and call the cops. I meant it. I used it<br/>\nas a safety measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, my husband and his brothers are always out of the house<br/>\nand never inform, are never back on time. It sometimes seems like they<br/>\nreturn home when all other options are gone. My husband will inform me, but<br/>\nwill still almost always return after she has gone to sleep. Their mother is<br/>\nvery controlling, and acts all wronged and tortured when they don&#39;t do what<br/>\nshe thinks is appropriate. She will never speak with them directly, but talk<br/>\nabout them to everyone except them. If I am out of town or otherwise out<br/>\novernight, my husband will simply not come home at all without informing.<br/>\nHis brother often is out all night. My husband and his brother do what they<br/>\nwant and avoid all conversation around it, including informing. They will be<br/>\nhome in the evening if she is not at home. They inform me if they will be<br/>\nlate, but not their own mother. There is no conflict between them, just<br/>\ncomplete avoidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think that it is also about how easily I can be me (for whatever<br/>\nreason) at home. In a way, even by insulting, my father unintentionally<br/>\nfreed me to be myself by removing the need to lie to be liked. And the<br/>\ngrandmother liked me no matter what. So I could be me as I was, even if I<br/>\nwas coming late.<br/>\n<br/>\nVidyut<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: When kids get older--a candid moment","postDate":"1266232122","msgId":50809,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3QjU0NDI0LUYzQ0EtNDQwRi05MDIyLThFRjc0M0I5Q0IyQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAxOTUwMWNhYWUwNCRiZWUxMDJjMCQzY2EzMDg0MCRAbmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGhsOTc1cCtxNGZnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aGw5cDY4K25xdDhAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwzYTkzZmZmMTEwMDIxNDIxMzBzMjUzNGU0MDBuYWQyNjI4Zjg2OTI5NGQwNEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDAxOTUwMWNhYWUwNCRiZWUxMDJjMCQzY2EzMDg0MCRAbmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":50808,"nextInTopic":50810,"prevInTime":50808,"nextInTime":50810,"topicId":50768,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Whether or not I worried depended on ages and who they were going out with - and maybe it is a little different with girls than with boys, I m not sure. -=-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-787013120\">-=-Whether or not I worried<br/>\ndepended on ages and who they were going out with - and maybe it is a  <br/>\nlittle<br/>\ndifferent with girls than with boys, I&#39;m not sure. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience it is different with girls.  Even though Holly is  <br/>\nstrong-willed and quick witted, I still worry about her physical  <br/>\nsafety more than I do or ever did about Kirby or Marty.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne morning before sunup Holly was still up and went for a walk up the  <br/>\nbike trail.  I think she was thirteen or so.  (If anyone remembers,  <br/>\nI&#39;d be happy to be corrected or reminded about the age.)   I was upset  <br/>\nand asked her to at least take the dog if she ever did that again,  <br/>\nwhich I didn&#39;t think she should ever do again.   She was upset in  <br/>\nreturn and said I wasn&#39;t like that with the boys.  I said she wasn&#39;t a  <br/>\nboy.  And she had dropped out of karate too early to defend herself,  <br/>\nand I didn&#39;t want to talk about what my fears were.  Rape.  Kidnap.   <br/>\nMurder.  The big stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was offended and felt I was a big sexist poop.  I was shocked that  <br/>\nshe would be so irresponsible with my baby girl. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I turned the whole deal over to Keith.  He reassured me and  <br/>\npersuaded her that it might not be such a great idea, leaving the  <br/>\nhouse in the dark when people didn&#39;t know where she had gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe went to a concert of Scarless, her favorite local band, a week and  <br/>\nsome ago, downtown at The Launchpad.  She had the Ford Taurus.  She  <br/>\nparked in one of those ratty little pay-per-space parking lots where  <br/>\nyou put the money in a numbered slot and then park in that number.   <br/>\nNot only not electric, not even mechanical.   When she came out there  <br/>\nwas a boot on the car.  Not a nice carboot-boot like in England. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>\nA big old flat anchor on one of the wheels.  For not paying.  There&#39;s  <br/>\nno way in the world to prove you paid in one of those places.  They  <br/>\nwanted $100 to take it off.  She had to walk a few blocks, she said,  <br/>\nto get cash.  She had also had to call Marty to transfer money from  <br/>\nher savings to checking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was frustrated about the unfairness of it.<br/>\nMy thoughts were about that too, at first, and I offered to go and  <br/>\nfind the company that did that and tell them off and get some or all  <br/>\nof her money back.  They didn&#39;t even give her a receipt, not a card.   <br/>\nAnd the flyer that was on the car when she came out, they took off and  <br/>\nkept.   That frustrated me.  But my deep mom thoughts were that the  <br/>\ncar was her safety,  her tank.  It was the place she could open with  <br/>\nthat key, and get into, and lock herself up and come home.  She had a  <br/>\ncar so she did NOT have to walk around downtown Albuquerque late at  <br/>\nnight.  But that was me, again, with my ugly mom-fears.

I made it through but it was<br/>\nunnecessarily hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorrying all night is soooo seldom necessary unless you have that kind<br/>\nof relationship, when it&#39;s *always* necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, this thing of worrying is something I want to think on more<br/>\ndeeply on for myself in relation to Karl. I know I could use some<br/>\nprevention pointers again even though I&#39;ve heard some pointers. I<br/>\nguess I&#39;ll go look see if Sandra or Joyce have &quot;worry&quot; pages on their<br/>\nwebsite. I *know* I&#39;m better at dealing with worry than my folks and<br/>\ntheir parents were. For sure!<br/>\n<br/>\nAny further thoughts? I&#39;m clearest on realizing that it&#39;s closely<br/>\nrelated to basic instinct, feelings which are there naturally for good<br/>\n(and bad) reasons, and that the feelings themselves are not the things<br/>\nto work on. I also know that I do in fact worry sometimes. And that<br/>\nconfidence comes partly (or perhaps wholly ) from trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/14/10, Jude &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:JudithAnneMurphy@...\">JudithAnneMurphy@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for sharing this, Sandra.
