The Camp Fire director for our area<br/>\nattended and was enthusiastic about our group getting<br/>\nstarted as she homeschooled her daughter for many<br/>\nyears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou did a lot more research than I did and since our<br/>\ngroup decided NOT to pursue it, I stopped looking. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;...As a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how<br/>\nmany ways can I say ick?  Curricula?  Grade levels? <br/>\nOutcome based? Am I just looking at this the wrong way<br/>\nor not understanding what they are trying to say?<br/>\n<br/>\nElsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When<br/>\nchildren and youth join Camp Fire, they start at the<br/>\nlevel appropriate to their grade.&quot;    Is this program<br/>\ntotally geared toward the institutional schooling<br/>\nsystem, and would we be totally out of place?  I don&#39;t<br/>\nreally want to separate my children out into narrow<br/>\nband age groups.  I don&#39;t think it is socially good<br/>\nfor them.  I am one of those who is of the opinion<br/>\nthat institutional schooling is intrinsically bad for<br/>\nthe human mind and spirit, and that the institutional<br/>\neducational model can never be made healthy enough to<br/>\nbe effective or positive.&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am pretty relaxed about their &quot;developmental<br/>\nassets&quot; and so forth.  If it was me, I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>\nquantifying how many hours of community service or<br/>\nnights out with friends, but I wouldn&#39;t be too worried<br/>\nabout it either.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCamp Fire is mostly geared to school children, but<br/>\nthey have also started a program called Family Clubs. <br/>\nThis is designed to specifically include moms AND dads<br/>\nas well as kids of all ages.  Seems tailor made for<br/>\nhomeschoolers.  I understand that some areas require<br/>\nleaders to attend training & if you can&#39;t attend, or<br/>\naren&#39;t near a Camp Fire office, you can&#39;t officially<br/>\nstart a club.  However, our director, Bev Field, has<br/>\noffered to help other homeschoolers get a Family Club<br/>\nstarted where ever they are.  (Let me know if you are<br/>\ninterested in her contact info).  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur major problem with Camp Fire was selling candy<br/>\nbars.  In forming a club, we were agreeing to<br/>\nparticipate in 2 major fundraisers a year.  One was a<br/>\nwalk-a-thon type event where we had to send letters to<br/>\n20 people asking for sponsorship.  We had to submit<br/>\nthe letters to the Camp Fire office and they would<br/>\ncheck and make sure we had the right number of letters<br/>\n(!) and then mail them for us.  The other was candy<br/>\nbar sales.  Each person would be required (?) to sell<br/>\nan ungodly # of candy bars, like 200.  The money<br/>\nraised went to support the area Camp Fire office.  We<br/>\nhad no problem with supporting the office, but we<br/>\nweren&#39;t allowed to come up with some other way to<br/>\nraise money or even just make a monetary donation<br/>\nINSTEAD of selling candy.  (We were told we could send<br/>\nletters to area businesses & maybe get a corporate<br/>\nsponsor who might want to buy hundreds of candy bars<br/>\nto give their employees & to support Camp Fire).  We<br/>\nwere also told there was no real consequence if you<br/>\ndidn&#39;t sell your allotted number.  Ok, so that was the<br/>\nmajor disagreement.  A few people had kids who wanted<br/>\neither girls-only or boys-only club and wanted to try<br/>\nscouts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband had another concern, which you didn&#39;t<br/>\nmention, and which I felt unsure about and that is<br/>\ntheir system for beads & badges.  He felt it was<br/>\nrewarding them for completing specific projects so<br/>\nthat the kids wouldn&#39;t be participating for the<br/>\nintrinsic value but to &quot;get&quot; the next bead or patch,<br/>\netc.   Another friend said it wasn&#39;t about rewards,<br/>\nbut just a sign of their accomplishment.  Any comments<br/>\nto share?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happened for us was that we discussed forming our<br/>\nown club and then from one of my many email lists<br/>\n-maybe it was this one- someone mentioned &quot;roots &<br/>\nshoots&quot;.  I had another organizational meeting in<br/>\nSeptember and we started a Roots & Shoots club.  It is<br/>\na program designed by the Jane Goodall Institute. <br/>\nHere is the website:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/index.html\">http://www.janegoodall.org/rs/index.html</a>  We meet 1st<br/>\n& 3rd Fridays 10 - noon.   We invite all ages, boys &<br/>\ngirls & their parents.  We rotate leadership among the<br/>\nparents and the first event was a bug party learning<br/>\nabout desert bugs including a bug scavenger hunt & bug<br/>\n&quot;show & tell&quot; and the second event was a field trip to<br/>\nthe AZ-Sonoran Desert Museum (thanks, Dawn!).  We have<br/>\nsome kinks to work out as our group has grown so large<br/>\nso quickly.  We&#39;ve kinda outgrown meeting at homes.  I<br/>\njust received the official Roots & Shoots manual last<br/>\nweek and it has a lot of interesting information that<br/>\nI still need to digest.<br/>\n<br/>\nheather mclean<br/>\ntucson AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nY!
