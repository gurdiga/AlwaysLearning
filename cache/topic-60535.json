She lets it get messy - <br/>\nmostly with books and clothes lying around, and then she cleans it <br/>\nthoroughly about every 3 or 4 weeks and does a bit of reorganizing, too, <br/>\neach time. She eagerly looks forward to doing it and plans ahead to have <br/>\ntime for it. I have never, and I mean NEVER not one single time in her <br/>\nlife, told her to clean her room. She does it purely for her own <br/>\npleasure in doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have done, many many times in her younger years, is gone into her <br/>\nroom and straightened things up for her. She often joined in, but not <br/>\nalways. Sometimes I did it when she wasn&#39;t there and it was a really <br/>\nsweet surprise for her. I did it cheerfully. She&#39;s my youngest - my <br/>\nolder kids can remember when they were little and I used to get worked <br/>\nup over trying to get them to clean up and help out, etc. But Rosie had <br/>\nmuch more of the benefit of me having reached a much better place in my <br/>\nown thinking about kids and chores, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60489,"nextTopicId":60474}}
