Not sure yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Cool, the more the merrier.  We&#39;re all getting excited, Cacie ran into a<br/>\nteen friend at a different party down in the bay area on Saturday and<br/>\nthey were figuring out the weeks, which made it seem much sooner. I just<br/>\nhope the weather warms up a bit, they swear it was warmer before we<br/>\narrived, but it&#39;s been way too windy and chilly this past week...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am at that stage in unpacking where it seems like the boxes reproduce<br/>\nas we sleep, but at least the walls are no repaired and painted (except<br/>\nthe bathroom), the furniture is in place, I own a stove and a<br/>\nrefrigerator from the Sears in Woodland (I feel so grown-up), and the<br/>\nindoors insect and spider population is at least greatly reduced. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe stars at night are amazing, and I watch the barn owls go out to hunt<br/>\nevery evening at dusk. We see wild pheasants, too, and lots of other<br/>\nbirds. And rabbits, many many rabbits, and one lizard on the warmest day.<br/>\nWe also found a place in Sacramento with a Target, a Trader Joe&#39;s, and a<br/>\ngreat Indian restaurant (with vegetable pakoras make the way Cacie likes<br/>\nthem) all fairly close together. It&#39;s near where Cacie&#39;s dad used to<br/>\nlive, although he&#39;s been homeless for the past month or so and has been<br/>\nsleeping in his car at various rest areas. Which sucks... <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the party is still on for April 6 - 7, all are welcome and good<br/>\ntent spce is still available. Also, if Kristi is reading, could you send<br/>\nme your email address? My dad&#39;s computer was crashing as I left, and I<br/>\nlost it..<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
