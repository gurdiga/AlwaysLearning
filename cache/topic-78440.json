I love pop-up books, and have lots of them.  Lots of Shakespeare books, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went to see if I could buy a couple locally, and maybe I can, but the website has something that made me so grumpy I’m thinking of ordering from Amazon instead of driving 9 miles to support an independent book seller.

Featuring five interactive spreads filled with dramatic pop-ups, fun foldouts, hilarious summaries, and fascinating commentaries, this is the perfect introduction to one of the world’s greatest playwrights and his enduring works.<br/>\n<br/>\n___________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI’ve known of these guys for over 30 years, have seen them live (at the old Vortex theatre in ABQ, owned the “Complete Works” and shared it with my kids repeatedly…<br/>\nTheir work is not aimed at children, though some kids can really enjoy it.  But few kids 7 to ten would even be able to read (with any understanding) even that description of the book.  There’s no reason for me to think that the book is for children.  But that store seems….   <br/>\n<br/>\nMy head is running around back and forth objecting. :-)  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir recommended reading level followed several quotes from reviews that all make it clear that it’s for all ages.<br/>\nI’m not sure who it is I’m trying to defend, here, emotionally.  <br/>\n<br/>\nLogic and wonder, I think.<br/>\nI don’t like bookstores to discourage teens and adults from buying pop-up books for themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I go to the store I’ll resurrect this rant, probably and say “Are you familiar with this company?  With their humor and writing?  Why is this in the kids’ section?”  And they’ll be thinking…  where is that little button that calls the police?  :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut surely that won’t happen if I order them from Amazon, and…<br/>\n…and I’ll save gasoline and so enable the planet to live longer.<br/>\n…and it will be safer.<br/>\n…and I will save time…  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere it is, anyway, introduced by the authors and the illustrator:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://reducedshakespeare.com/books/pop-up-shakespeare/\">http://reducedshakespeare.com/books/pop-up-shakespeare/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt’s another argument, for me, against thinking of when unschoolers can read.  “Can read” what?  Maybe, the pop-up Shakespeare. :-) <br/>\n<br/>\nThose poor second graders whose parents might think they should be able to read it because a website said so.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67507,"nextTopicId":78448}}
