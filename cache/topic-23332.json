(But be careful that you don&#39;t turn this <br/>\n&gt; into a &quot;language arts&quot; lesson - I almost hesitate to even mention <br/>\n&gt; this aspect of it.) -=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I love the questions, but I wouldn&#39;t share them with young kids.<br/>\nIt could be great for the mom to watch the shows with those ideas in mind, <br/>\nthough.<br/>\nOR... not to watch the shows, but to be aware that her kids might (if not <br/>\ndiscouraged) figure out all those things on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was a kid I LOVED English classes.   I took extra ones, then went to <br/>\ncollege and studied English and then taught English.    I LOVE that stuff.   <br/>\nBut...<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...<br/>\nThings I learned painstakingly, did grudgingly, &quot;studied&quot; and then pressed <br/>\nothers to try to do are all things my kids do without knowing what it is, <br/>\nwithout considering that it&#39;s &quot;hard&quot; or even has a formal name or particular jargon.<br/>\n<br/>\nComparison/contrast:    NO PROBLEM<br/>\nCharacter analysis? no problem<br/>\nPlot summary and analysis?   no problem<br/>\nThematic discussions (and tying back to comparison/contrast and the rest...) <br/>\nno problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey might not know those terms, but if they read them in context they would <br/>\nunderstand them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they do know is how to discuss lyrics, composition, dialog, <br/>\ncharacterization, motive, theme, the effects of music and artistic presentation...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s &quot;just watching movies&quot; or &quot;just listening to music&quot; to most people, but <br/>\nit&#39;s all the best parts of &quot;language arts&quot; in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23312,"nextTopicId":23330}}
