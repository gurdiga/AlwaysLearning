(my last job, before having kids).. and<br/>\nI loved it.  Maybe it was because the practice was a small one..just me and<br/>\nthe vet and we made a great team. I lived in Denver at that time. I worked<br/>\nthe desk, developed the x-rays, cleaned the equipment, walked and bathed the<br/>\ncritters, gave injections, cleaned teeth, assisted with surgury too..   We<br/>\nfixed a lot of hips..saw our share of car accidents.. but mostly spays/<br/>\nneuters and shots were the mainstay. It was the best job I ever had.. I<br/>\nwanted to be a vet when I was a kid..so that&#39;s the closest I ever came. I<br/>\nwould love to do it again once my kids are older. Of course I live on a<br/>\nsmall farm now and have many critters of my own, so I do play vet a lot<br/>\nanyway..LOL!<br/>\nJulie in MO</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6372,"nextTopicId":6374}}
