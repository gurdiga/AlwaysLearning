In the past  <br/>\nit tended to end up where one kid was way ahead of the other, and not  <br/>\nusually wanting to slow down and wait. Or they&#39;d want to go in  <br/>\ndifferent directions. Or they&#39;d both want to be carried. That kind of  <br/>\nthing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot so last night. I think part of it is my increased ability to go  <br/>\nwith the flow and be more relaxed in general, and part of it is where  <br/>\nthe kids are right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n=============<br/>\nand<br/>\n---------------------<br/>\nI actually did dishes and laundry and found the joy in it.
