(For long complicated reasons involving my dying mother. <br/>\nWell...she was dying at the time. She actually DID go through with it. This has <br/>\nnothing to do with the story...I am just addled. I remember learning in school <br/>\nthat Thomas Edison was considered &quot;addled&quot; as a child. And he kind of unschooled, <br/>\nultimately, so I guess there is an unschooling connection.  ANYWAY....)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we got story tapes from the library. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the ones I picked up was George Carlin&#39;s. Julian had never heard him, <br/>\nand LOVED it....played it over and over again. It&#39;s fun watching Julian listen <br/>\nto something like that that he finds REALLY funny....he just is overcome with <br/>\nlaughter. It reminds me of those times when he was very little and you could <br/>\ndo that romping kind of thing which would just fill him with utter joy and <br/>\nlaughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, when he wakes up (often around the crack of noon these days) I&#39;ll <br/>\nshare them with him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :)<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14833,"nextTopicId":14839}}
