This is how I&#39;ve<br/>\nexplained inertia so far (it&#39;s probably all they&#39;ll need to know unless they<br/>\nspecialize.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNewton&#39;s Laws of Physics<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst Law:  An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion<br/>\ntends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless<br/>\nacted upon by an unbalanced force.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Your sister will keep playing quietly unless you go in there and throw her<br/>\nBarbies around. Stop messing with her equilibrium.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond Law: Acceleration depends on the net force acting on the object as<br/>\nwell as the mass of the object.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I know she jumps higher if you pinch harder. Stop doing it anyway.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThird Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Well of course she hit you back. What did you expect?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I suppose I could use golf balls and ping pong balls and inclined planes<br/>\nfor all this, but IMO, physics applies to human relationships just as well!<br/>\nAnd while this is slightly tongue in cheek, it really is how I&#39;ve explained<br/>\nthe three laws to my son. This way, he grokked it. Later, if he&#39;s<br/>\ninterested, we can do the experiments.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, he&#39;s fascinated by friction. He thinks it would be neat if he had<br/>\nfrictionless skates. That led to a discussion of gravity, and space, and the<br/>\nthree laws, and acceleration, and on and on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince my daughter is the youngest and doesn&#39;t have anyone to pick on, I<br/>\nguess she&#39;ll be at a learning disadvantage here... ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94797851,"authorName":"Karin","from":"&quot;Karin&quot; &lt;curtkar@...&gt;","profile":"kc85022","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] gaps in learning","postDate":"1020958847","msgId":6797,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwYjAwMWMxZjc2ZiRlM2IxZGVjMCQ2NDAwYThjMEBnb2R6aWxsYT4=","referencesHeader":"PDNlLjFkZjEyZDAxLjJhMGI0MGYyQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6798,"prevInTime":6796,"nextInTime":6798,"topicId":6797,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... something ... hadn t ... things ... though. ... have ... old, ...
