My dh (a public high school teacher) has had a myspace page since it&#39;s beginning and has tons of students and former students as his friends (as well as his own kids). My dh is always the teacher the kids go to when they have a problem. They know they will get non-judgemental and respectful advice (and help when needed) from him. Of the homeschoolers I know that have myspace accounts, all of them have their kids, and their kid&#39;s friends in their networks. They also all have their accounts private (the kids that is). <br/>\n  I think the media latches onto, and encourages, the image of sullen teens who don&#39;t want anything to do with their parents (there are many movies and tv shows that play to that image). I know there are a lot of teens out there that don&#39;t want to interact with their parents, because they can&#39;t have an honest relationship with them. I believe our culture encourages the great divide between kids and their parents mainly by encouraging an authoritarian parenting/family style which pervades every segment of society. By this I mean, the schools, the workplace and social situations.<br/>\n  I think a lot of homeschoolers, especially unschoolers, have a culture unto themselves. It&#39;s a culture of mutual respect, communication, understanding, and cooperation. Sadly, I believe there are many, many kids out there who never get a chance to experience this culture in their lives and they will go on perpetuating the division between the ages.<br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n   <br/>\n  I can create what I can imagine. ~ Charlene Kingston <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nBe a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

I can understand why someone wants to hide from others, such as employer, strangers etc. I have a friend who was fired from her job because her and a co worker had a mishap. She went and put something on her myspace page about him. He seen it, took the info to their job and she was fired.
