I don&#39;t hear choice, I hear middle class privilege. What do you think?====<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>There&#39;s some truth to this, I suppose--I did a big reading project on social class in the last couple of years because I became interested in it, and class stuff goes beyond how much money you have to what kinds of places you&#39;re comfortable in, how you relate to authority, whether you know how to navigate certain systems--like getting into and staying in college. One book I read was a memoir by a working-class woman who was the first in her family to go to college. She was admitted to a private college on a scholarship, and after a couple of years, lost the scholarship for some reason. She dropped out because she had no idea--and nobody told her even when she was seeking help from advisors at the school--that it was possible to transfer to a less expensive school. That&#39;s a kind of cultural knowledge people who have college in their family history are more likely to know than people who don&#39;t, and it made a big difference in her life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would not be surprised if middle-class people in general were more likely to have the means to unschool, and the knowledge of systems and the idea that you can work within and around them that are so valuable to unschoolers--like the idea that you can translate what you&#39;re doing into &quot;edu-speak&quot; both requires some knowledge of what jargony educator language sounds like AND the notion that it&#39;s OK to be sneaky with authority like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I don&#39;t find &quot;but this is an expression of your privilege!&quot; to be always a useful thing to think about. Recognizing privilege has become important to me, but it&#39;s not always the most useful lens. A friend who is working-class and very politicized about class issues recently used the &quot;well, that&#39;s just an expression of your privilege&quot; argument to me when I talked on my blog about what I wear, and I&#39;ve also had it leveled at me with regard to homeschooling at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy response was that if you want to look at the world through that lens and that lens only, almost everything I do every day could be seen as an expression of privilege, from waking up in a clean bed in a warm house in a safe neighborhood, to feeding my kids three meals plus snacks every day, to driving a reliable car, to putting on clothes that are not stained and don&#39;t have holes in them, to ordering the kids some used books from Amazon just because I think they might like them, to having the computer and the internet connection to log in to Amazon in the first place...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve actually had someone tell me I shouldn&#39;t homeschool because &quot;not everyone can homeschool&quot; and she found it an intolerable expression of my economic privilege. But by that argument, I shouldn&#39;t feed my kids three meals a day because not everyone can, or live in this comfortable if modest neighborhood because not everyone can, or own a car because not everyone can.

Parents do not need to be &quot;well-educated&quot; to unschool successfully, but they do need the ability to seek out and absorb the philosophical underpinnings of unschooling, namely  trust in their kids&#39; ability to learn, respect for their children&#39;s &#39;personhood&#39;, and being mindfully and lovingly present so they can support their children&#39;s explorations of the world. They need to set an example of life-long learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Lack of money does not preclude unschooling. The wealthiest family I know has their son in a very expensive private school.  Most of the unschoolers in my local group are surviving on one working-class income.  They shop in op-shops, have weekly food budgets, buy clothes at markets, all of which are valuable unschooling experiences. They don&#39;t whinge about lack of money because they have actively chosen an unschooling life. (That&#39;s not to say that they don&#39;t discuss money, but rather that the discussion is not self-pitying.)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. A prominent family in local unschooling circles here has 6 kids, ranging in age from 21 to 7. They seem to be unschooling very happily. I, with my 2 kids, am unschooling very happily. I think the parents&#39; attitude, rather than the number of children, is key in determining how unschooling will flow.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Coming from a broken home myself, it is incredibly clear to me that a strong and loving relationship between parents is a key element in the fabric of an unschooling life.  It is not essential, but I do think it provides optimal conditions for unschooling to thrive. In fact, I have found the ideas on relationships gleaned from this list to be just as useful in my daily life as the ideas about children.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.

Part  <br/>\nof that environment is building relationships with kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent can&#39;t or won&#39;t let go of the schoolish ideas they have  <br/>\nabout what&#39;s necessary for learning, it will interfere with the above  <br/>\nprocess. It&#39;s impossible to generalize about what impact or how  <br/>\nextensive the impact will be. It depends on the parents and their  <br/>\npersonalities, the children and their personalities and what the  <br/>\nparents are doing or not doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a society we&#39;re used to seeing education as a process to apply to  <br/>\neveryone. But unschooling (and homeschooling) should be seen as a  <br/>\nchoice parents make for their family. Just because unschooling  <br/>\nmatches human hardwiring for learning, if a mom can&#39;t let go of the  <br/>\nbaggage that prevents her from unschooling, unschooling is not going  <br/>\nto be &quot;best&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; but I wonder if the issue is about &quot;formal or text&quot; vs real  <br/>\n&gt; learning, or if the issue is really about purpose and agency in  <br/>\n&gt; learning.  Is it that learning must happen in the doing of  <br/>\n&gt; productive jobs to be authentic?  That learning from a text is  <br/>\n&gt; inauthentic?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to ask deeper questions when someone has a surface  <br/>\nunderstanding. That&#39;s not meant as an insult. It&#39;s a generalization.  <br/>\nIf your understanding of terms is still half or mostly in the other  <br/>\ncamp, the questions can&#39;t peel back the layers properly. As an  <br/>\nanalogy you may be asking about peeling an orange when you&#39;re  <br/>\npicturing an onion. The answers you get won&#39;t make sense until you  <br/>\ncan see that it&#39;s an onion you&#39;re holding and what we&#39;re talking  <br/>\nabout is something entirely different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of learning the &quot;why&quot; is more important than the &quot;what&quot;. Two  <br/>\nchildren can be doing workbooks and one be unschooling and the other  <br/>\nbe schooling. If a child and the mom sees the workbook as no  <br/>\ndifferent than any other activity: something to do because its fun or  <br/>\nintriguing, then they&#39;re unschooling. If a child sees the workbook as  <br/>\nan important way to acquire skills to use a tool (like math) then  <br/>\nthey aren&#39;t unschooling. If the mom sees the workbook as an important  <br/>\nway to acquire skills to use a tool (like math) then it&#39;s likely  <br/>\nshe&#39;ll interfere with the child&#39;s free learning and get in the way of  <br/>\nunschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of what makes unschooling hard to understand is that unschooling  <br/>\nis about what the kids do, but what we talk about here is more about  <br/>\nwhat the parents do. Given a nurturing, rich environment, kids can&#39;t  <br/>\nhelp but learn naturally. (John Holt said &quot;Fish swim. Humans learn.&quot;)  <br/>\nThe learning part happens inside the kids and is out of our control.  <br/>\nWhat&#39;s in our control is the environment. Part of the environment is  <br/>\nour attitudes and understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; If so, then what about people who read manuals to get up to speed  <br/>\n&gt; in certain parts of their job? Is it authentic?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;re looking for new rules to replace the old ones. Whether it&#39;s  <br/>\n&quot;authentic&quot; is a question that will get you off the path to  <br/>\nunderstanding unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re not trying to remove schoolish learning and replace it with  <br/>\nauthentic learning. We&#39;re trying to help kids explore what intrigues  <br/>\nthem and run the parts of the world through their lives we think  <br/>\nmight also intrigue them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder if it can help some people feel empowered and others more  <br/>\n&gt; discouraged? Have you asked?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unlike school, real learning isn&#39;t linear. It can&#39;t be broken down  <br/>\ninto chunks that are isolated from each other. What&#39;s read today as  <br/>\ndiscouraging may be read next week as encouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it&#39;s best to just absorb and let ideas percolate. Trust  <br/>\nthat there&#39;s value in there somewhere because others did find it of  <br/>\nvalue. Maybe someone won&#39;t find the value in it for themselves but  <br/>\nthat&#39;s okay. They should focus on the parts that have meaning and let  <br/>\nthe other ideas gel.

I threaded the needle for her, but she did the <br/>\nsewing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the girl wants to design clothes, she could start with dolls clothes. She <br/>\ncould also work with paper patterns. I learnt to sew from methodically <br/>\nfollowing the instructions on paper patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easiest to start with is simple skirts, then pajama type pants or <br/>\nsweats, simple tops, shift dresses/nightgown, then blouses with collars, <br/>\nthen shirts with yokes, then shirt dresses, tailored pants, and boxy <br/>\njackets, then lined jackets and men&#39;s tailored pants, finally tailored <br/>\novercoats and mens suits, and evening wear. That is in order of sewing <br/>\ndifficulty in my opinion as a sewist of 30 years experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe will not find much of the math from textbooks beyond simple arithmetic <br/>\nhelpful for the actual clothing designing. This I know for sure. Maybe the <br/>\nmost basic understanding of percentages for fabric blends, but it&#39;s just <br/>\ngetting familiar with the feel of 100% silk versus 50/50 polyrayon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you do need to know, because it is intensely useful, is simple circle <br/>\ngeometry.<br/>\nHere are the formulae to remember (with the limitations of the word program <br/>\nof my email):<br/>\nC=2 x pi x r<br/>\nA= pi  x r squared<br/>\nThere - no need to stress over the math text book.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever I suppose what you are really concerned about is the math needed to <br/>\nget into college to study fashion design. Probably all she needs is one <br/>\nsemester of remedial math at community college to have enough on paper <br/>\ncredits, along with all the people who were at school the whole time but <br/>\nstill didn&#39;t get math after however many years of boring, text book drill. <br/>\nIf she likes doing the math, that&#39;s another story.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH if her portfolio is good and she has talent and vision, the design <br/>\nschool will most likely find ways to accommodate any math credits she might <br/>\nneed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is where she should be directing her attention if her passion at the <br/>\nmoment is fashion design - sewing, exploring textiles, fashion magazines, <br/>\nfashion history and current designers, photography, drawing and color <br/>\ntheory - portfolio development. Even business math is so easily taken care <br/>\nof with bookkeeping software.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn draws the clothing designs. I sew them for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

I think it is a start but the whole record keeping thing is very burdensome.  How to make it less burdensome, how to make it less in general seem important.  At this point I don&#39;t &quot;have-to&quot; keep records beyond attendance, but that assurance can go out the window with a court case.  Maybe I should simply keep photos on her work as a record, and notes rather than a journal per se.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;In regards to your comment that &quot;I don&#39;t hear choice, I hear middle class privilege, &quot; I don&#39;t necessarily see that in the &quot;Have to&quot; page, but I do agree that unschooling seems almost impossible for families in other income/class brackets, but that is a more political discussion than this list is for....&quot; Brie<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure its political, I think these are real issues that people, including myself have to sort through and deal with.  It is an honest question this half-to because as Sandra said in an earlier posting, <br/>\n&quot;My second thought is that not everyone can unschool.  It&#39;s not as easy  <br/>\nas it looks.  It&#39;s not anyone&#39;s &quot;right&quot; and it might not be doable at  <br/>\nall for many families.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis says to me that when considering what one &quot;has-to&quot; do is contingent on important contextual issues which I am trying to sort out. Should parents be well educatated in order to unschool?  It seems that many are.  Should there be a certain level of wealth present?  WHat might that be?  Is the number of children a factor? Stability of the marriage?  What if these factors change?  It can be quite burdensome to talk about ideals without contextual factors.

At this point we are attempting to gather a sewing machine and supplies.  I don&#39;t think doing a math text is curriculum itself -- curriculum actually means I think the course of one&#39;s life.  Heidi sees the text as a means to her end, maybe it comes from schooling and that&#39;s why she perceives it that way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the notion that creating a rich life as the core of what unschooling is seems to be the best explanation I have heard to date on it. But, I wonder, say if there are three children in the family, what happens when one of them expresses a strong interest and develops something that the other children are drawn into.  Is this then authentic learning for the other kids?  If so what makes it more valid than a parent doing something that attracts the interest of those two?

I certainly have no interest in promoting formal learning, but I wonder if the issue is about &quot;formal or text&quot; vs real learning, or if the issue is really about purpose and agency in learning.  Is it that learning must happen in the doing of productive jobs to be authentic?  That learning from a text is inauthentic?

And, there are some things that high school can offer her that she may want later. .===<br/>\n<br/>\nPotential future jobs and potential future school is far off from where you are now.  If, when you are at that stage and you find that school is better than no school, then that&#39;s what you should do.  High school age kids can be very creative in how they fill their schedules around a parent&#39;s work schedule and you may find that it won&#39;t matter whether or not she&#39;s in school.<br/>\n<br/>\n==I read the web page, and I&#39;d like to argue for a minute that this rhetoric of choices is more a middle class reality, to quote===<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not so sure about that.  Just thinking about it in general in a world wide way, everywhere, everyone, all over the world is making choices.  Sure some people make choices that get them killed, or are so far against their societal norms that they ostracize themselves or endanger themselves, but still they are making choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n==Okay – let me respond rather cynically to this post. What I hear is that; no one can call my unschooling into question because 1) I am well educated, 2) I am middle class and care for and provide for my children above cultural reproach, 3) I have a husband who provides income so I can devote my time to my children, and 4) I sacrificed my job possibilities for the sake of my family ie I&#39;m not home because I&#39;m too dumb to work, and 5) we can afford to run our children to many interesting activities, and 6) we have the cultural capital and resources to counter-sue if anyone raises issues with our philosophical approach to our children&#39;s education. I don&#39;t hear choice, I hear middle class privilege. What do you think?====<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing &quot;well educated&quot; has little to do with an unschooling parent.  Knowing how to think and be creative and explore are far more essential.  Since unschooling requires thought, it generally goes that an unschooling parent is more knowledgeable about lots of things, not necessarily &quot;well educated&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are people who unschool and have nice incomes and there are people that unschool and are near the poverty line.  There are some people who unschool, who both work, and there are far more folks that unschool on one income, or 2 part time ones.  Having 2 parents helps enormously, but there are people who do it being single.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a priviledge, but it doesn&#39;t have to do with middle class incomes so much as it has to do with parents who have that as their priority and make it happen.  In other words, the parents are choosing to do so despite or because of their financial abilities to do so.  Having money helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n==Yesterday I discussed this with Heidi, and she told me that she liked doing math out of a textbook because it was a short hand way to get her to the math she will need for designing clothes – the math book is more accessible to her than design. I think this is a very nuanced understanding of curriculum, what do you think? ===<br/>\n<br/>\nText book math has very little to do with designing clothing.  This is clearly an area that deschooling needs to happen.  Sewing and designing can and does incorporate mathematical skills, but it&#39;s certainly not necessary to prepare for sewing and designing by doing math first.  I&#39;d say that the math will and can be learned as a side effect of doing the sewing and designing.  Why isn&#39;t she designing clothing if this is something that interests her?  There are so many resources to draw from if that is something she&#39;s interested in.  One can learn about the whole wide world by learning about fashion and design, through history, commerce, cultural differences, textiles, recycling, etc.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":148869672,"authorName":"rosehavencottage","from":"&quot;rosehavencottage&quot; &lt;rosehavencottage@...&gt;","profile":"rosehavencottage","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: &quot;create a rich life&quot;","postDate":"1267760136","msgId":51402,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhtcHU2OCtscHZzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEY2ODRGMjE4LTk0REItNENBMS1BQTBGLUNDRDRCOUZBMUM1NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":51401,"nextInTopic":51403,"prevInTime":51401,"nextInTime":51403,"topicId":51383,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sometimes she makes<br/>\nmistakes, but it doesn&#39;t rattle her - she knows that&#39;s part of the process.<br/>\nShe sells her hats and fingerless gloves at a local store.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was in public school until she was almost 10, we did some Keys to<br/>\nMathematics workbooks when we were &quot;homeschooling,&quot; but she hasn&#39;t done a<br/>\nmath curriculum in probably almost four years. I can&#39;t remember exactly how<br/>\nlong it&#39;s been - math curriculum was the first to go for us &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeidi doesn&#39;t need a math curriculum to make patterns. The Internet is a<br/>\nwonderful resource if she needs help understanding how to do something -<br/>\nYouTube is especially great. Instead of thinking of her as a kid who needs<br/>\nto learn how to do math, think of her as a person who needs help making her<br/>\npatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf design is one of Heidi&#39;s interests, maybe you could think about how to<br/>\nsupport her in that interest, to begin creating a rich environment for her.<br/>\nDoes she need time, materials, a workspace, a mentor, a visit to some cool<br/>\nstores for ideas, help finding fashion websites? You don&#39;t need to do it all<br/>\nat once. Think about what would help her the most now, or be the most<br/>\ninteresting to her right now.

There was some excellent pieces of advice/thoughts I&#39;d like to respond to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;ve been reading more about how this unschooling works. Being forced to do anything really does more harm than good. &quot;<br/>\n\t== Insistence leads to resistence is it simply just rude to be the judge of what someone must learn?  I had an interesting conversation today with Heidi.  She has homeschooled in the past, schooled, and I asked her if she wanted to unschool.  She definitely chose the later.  She has me a bit kicking and screaming along the way.  I think part of it is my own history of homeschooling.  When I began there was no internet, I worked to create a rich learning environment for my (eventually) 12 children to share in.  We bounced around between philosophies, and I think in all it was kind of a cycle we followed  unit studies, exhaustion then nothing, traditional books, boredom, back to the next unit study.  Some of the kids were able to unschool themselves and ran their own learning and I supported that, but I never felt that I could do unschooling justice with so many kids. Part of that was I think because my kids needed some experiences that I was not equipped or able to give them.  I also began when we had to hide from the law.  I see that fear is still with me.===<br/>\nQuestions to answer:<br/>\nHow old is Heidi and why does she need to go back to school in a year or so?<br/>\nI wonder why you are keeping this big reservation - &quot;have to put her back in school&quot; - in your mind. If there is some reason that you will &quot;have to&quot; put her back in school, it might be worth revealing.<br/>\n==Heidi is 11, and while I am finishing my graduate school she can stay home with me,  but I fear that a job job might make unschooling difficult.  And, there are some things that high school can offer her that she may want later.  I&#39;m a single mom with four kids at home, and other kids I keep up with who live with their Dad, and grad school to boot.  My context of homeschooling is very different than the life we are leading now.  My view of unschoolers is of parents with a lot going on that the kids can join in on, and two parents. I feel rather inadequate to meet Heidi&#39;s request.===<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I have been having her keep a learning journal where she records <br/>\nher activities and plans her learning for the day. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is your new unschooling plan, or that&#39;s what you have been doing <br/>\nas part of the structured homeschooling?<br/>\n===We didn&#39;t journal unless we wanted to before.  I just don&#39;t know if I can record Heidi&#39;s learning adequately if I attempt to do it, much happens outside of my awareness and it can be difficult to capture without her input.===<br/>\nAdvice I like and questions I have about it:<br/>\nAs far as journaling for record keeping to be legal: First, is it necessary? Second, do you know your laws? and, Third, Why aren&#39;t you, the mom, doing the record keeping if it&#39;s necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it&#39;s not necessary, then journaling should be up to the person doing the journaling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to being behind, well depending on how old she is, much of what goes on in school is repetition.  If she is high school age and wanting a diploma, that&#39;s different and will usually require some sort of credit hours.<br/>\nI think the legal requirements of homeschooling are the parents&#39; business and responsibility. Don&#39;t assume what these would be, and don&#39;t do more than the law absolutely requires.<br/>\n<br/>\n==I think this is a good point, I&#39;m trying to shift the burden to Heidi in ways that really don&#39;t fulfill my responsible protective role for her.  I feel that, thanks for making it explicit.  On the other hand, as I said before, it can be difficult to capture the spontaneous learning of another.  Many of her thinking and activities are outside of my observation.  It can be difficult at times to catch up on these conversations with the pressing needs of other children.==<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIF you want to unschool:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think having any kind of journal *requirement* is a barrier both to deschooling and unschooling in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think she is not experiencing her freedom while she is having to account to you for the learning value of her activities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you won&#39;t be able to see natural learning working fully while you are insisting on keeping the learning schoolish.<br/>\n===I wonder if she can see the journal as not accountability to me, but protective for herself and a resource to draw from.  I mean, after all, people will ask her about her learning all the time.  It was one thing to answer this as homeschoolers in away that navigated the social space safely for my kids.  Don&#39;t others face this issue?===<br/>\nDon&#39;t try to dissect what she is learning, and don&#39;t continue to ask her to do so. Just give her time to genuinely deschool, and then help her do what she wants to *do*. The learning happens automatically. <br/>\n<br/>\nSupport her computer time with practical help - bring snacks, check her comfort - instead of evaluating it. <br/>\n===I think this is very good advice on her use of computer games, also I celebrated some of her wins and asked her why she liked some of her games. Eventually we got into some good conversations in the flow of our day I&#39;m starting to suspect that this is where the magic of unschooling is == normal respectful dialogue with my daughter about what is interesting for her and us.==<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling isn&#39;t about merely minimizing the painful. It is about living a wonderful life today.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- I&#39;m nervous because if I do have to put her back in school in a <br/>\nyear or so,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy would you &quot;have to&quot; do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease think about &quot;have to&quot;:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/haveto\">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>\n==I read the web page, and I&#39;d like to argue for a minute that this rhetoric of choices is more a middle class reality, to quote===<br/>\nChoice is a really important conceptnot just semantics. It&#39;s the difference between anger, regret, resentment and happiness, comfort and joy in life. I chose to have my children when in grad school; I chose to follow my husband to New Mexico instead of staying at PSU to teach and raise two babies by myself; I chose to finish my degree; I chose to limit my job search geographically. I did not get the one job that I wanted, possibly based on the choices I made. But, with a pool of 400 applicants, there&#39;s a very good chance that I would not have gotten that job even if I&#39;d made different choiceseven if I&#39;d done the things that everyone was telling me I *HAD* to do along the way to get a tenure-track professorship. There are a lot of miserable, lonely people out there who played by someone else&#39;s rules and still don&#39;t have jobs. I have no resentment or regret against my children because I chose them, though some people in my position might. My children were first to me, and they would have been first even if I&#39;d gotten this other job. That is my choice in how I mother, and I make that choice every single day when I wake up.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/haveto\">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>\n==Okay  let me respond rather cynically to this post.  What I hear is that; no one can call my unschooling into question because 1) I am well educated, 2) I am middle class and care for and provide for my children above cultural reproach, 3) I have a husband who provides income so I can devote my time to my children, and 4) I sacrificed my job possibilities for the sake of my family ie I&#39;m not home because I&#39;m too dumb to work, and 5) we can afford to run our children to many interesting activities, and 6) we have the cultural capital and resources to counter-sue if anyone raises issues with our philosophical approach to our children&#39;s education.  I don&#39;t hear choice, I hear middle class privilege.  What do you think?====<br/>\nIf you try to homeschool with the idea that your pickup truck should <br/>\nkeep up with the speeding train in case she needs to jump from one to <br/>\nthe other, that&#39;s kind of how homeschooling goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t speed alongside the school tracks at all, though.<br/>\nThinking that your daughter &quot;plans her learning for the day&quot; is quite <br/>\nopposite of unschooling, in which you create a rich life and learning <br/>\nhappens all the time.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n===This is very interesting reading, which I would like to discuss more in another post that hasn&#39;t gone over the top such as this one.  I will say that, &quot;creating a rich life&quot; is the challenge isn&#39;t it?  Yesterday I discussed this with Heidi, and she told me that she liked doing math out of a textbook because it was a short hand way to get her to the math she will need for designing clothes  the math book is more accessible to her than design.  I think this is a very nuanced understanding of curriculum, what do you think?  Also, I never suspected that any of my kids would choose to go to school, but some did to play sports, and now they have to due to the divorce.  Is it totally reasonable to presume our children might never have to jump tracks?===<br/>\n<br/>\nMost jobs are learned on the job. Even when someone has to have an <br/>\nengineering degree to get a job, he will have NO idea what the <br/>\nprojects will be about in advance of his acceptance interview. <br/>\nMedical school only qualifies people to be residents, where they learn <br/>\nto be doctors on the job.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n===in my view the interesting thing about learning on the job is that it often assumes certain skills in numeracy and literacy  at least for the professional ones you mention.  Few people go to medical skill without being able to read (or at if that, without a literate background through other means). There is certainly a great deal of consideration to be made for issues of numeracy and literacy even in supposedly non-professional settings that are complex and nothing like school learning. Even the mental math we do in grocery stores is complex, but not due to math as much as complex balancing of tradeoffs. In my view the problem with school learning is that it doesn&#39;t answer authentic questions and has prescribed endpoints for learning, but I&#39;m not sure if this invalidates schooling per se and is a necessary condition of schooling, or if another kind of schooling can be valuable.
