I&#39;m a disappointed in a couple of the points they made <br/>\nbut overall it&#39;s positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was kind of afraid they would skunk me, as I was totally insistent that the <br/>\nthird week in May was NOT a good time for our family to have two extensive <br/>\nvisits from a photographer.  &quot;You won&#39;t even know she&#39;s there,&quot; the editor told <br/>\nme.  And when I said &quot;There&#39;s nothing to photograph that won&#39;t look like them <br/>\njust living everyday lives,&quot; she assured me the photographer was a <br/>\nprofessional.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.  &quot;Professional&quot; enough to make the week of preparations before an SCA <br/>\nevent, while we&#39;re hauling out of our house enough wooden benches, tables, boxes <br/>\nand chests full of medievalish dishes, clothes and camping equipment to set <br/>\nup five days of food and camp for a dozen and some people?  That does NOT make <br/>\nmy house look photogenic at all.  And I was making bread, in already-hot New <br/>\nMexico, and didn&#39;t need to be further interviewed by a photographer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered REALLY good photo-ops where there would be more homeschoolers than <br/>\njust my kids.  I gave specific times and places, none more than a mile from my <br/>\nhome, six different activities guaranteed to look cool in the paper, but they <br/>\nwanted pictures of me homeschooling my kids.  I said that would look my me <br/>\ndriving them around or me watching a movie with them or them telling me a story. <br/>\n  She was getting really frustrated, but not as frustrated as I was getting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are no photos of me or the kids, which is fine.  They got plenty of <br/>\nschooly-looking stuff to publish from other families.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will be online for a week or so, and then will be available only <br/>\nto subscribers to the Journal site.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":15417,"nextTopicId":15419}}
