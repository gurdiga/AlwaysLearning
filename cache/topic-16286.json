It was posted to the <br/>\nUnschoolingDiscussion list, but I thought there might be people here with great <br/>\nideas.  There could be a free book and temporary immortality in it for you! (And <br/>\nyou&#39;d help other people.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEither mail them to Kathryn or just respond here.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbara Sher, the author of Wishcraft and other books, is willing to speak at <br/>\nthe Live & Learn Unschooling Conference in August in Massachusetts if we can <br/>\nhelp her by sending her tips, stories, and anecdotes about how we empower and <br/>\nnurture our children (or were nurtured ourselves, as children) so that they <br/>\ndon&#39;t forget who they are and what their dreams are.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has agreed that if we can send her at least one hundred useable stories <br/>\nor tips in the next month, she&#39;ll come. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore details: She says,  &quot;I need to know what parents learned, what they wish <br/>\nthey had known earlier, what they wish someone had done for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven parts of stories and questions would be great. But certainly and good <br/>\n(or bad) experiences you&#39;ve had, and things you do that seem to work, or <br/>\ndon&#39;t, <br/>\netc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a number of my own stories and tips of course, but in a &quot;tips&quot; books, <br/>\nthe wider the experiences -- that is the more people contribute -- the more <br/>\npeople it can help. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone whose contribution I use will certainly get a book (it might be an <br/>\ne-book at first).&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome examples: Julie&#39;s story about her grandfather, maybe something about <br/>\nwhat you learned about chores...<br/>\n<br/>\nTIP: Remind your children to pay attention to what their interests and dreams <br/>\nare. Let them know that these are of great importance to them and to the <br/>\nworld. Teach them that when they love doing something, they&#39;re sure to be <br/>\nvery <br/>\ngood at it. Tell them to be themselves, not try to be like someone else, <br/>\nbecause <br/>\nthere are great and unique gifts inside them, and every human is an original, <br/>\nand one of a kind. <br/>\n<br/>\nTIP: remind children that college is only one way to achieve success or even <br/>\nto earn a living. If they enjoy college, they should go. If not, it&#39;s not <br/>\nessential. (They can always start their own business and hire college <br/>\ngraduates if <br/>\nthey like.) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI need everything I can get, and SOON!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any questions, please ask me. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all!<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:KathrynJB@...\">KathrynJB@...</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16285,"nextTopicId":16291}}
