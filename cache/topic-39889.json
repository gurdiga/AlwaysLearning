The traditions of the different groups/tribes can vary widely.  I don&#39;t really have any ideas for a quick introduction into Native Americans in general.  My family has been pretty surrounded by Native culture all of my life, both due to location and my dad&#39;s job.  We live in southern New Mexico, very close to the Mescalero Apache Nation, and my dad worked with the tribe quite a bit and had many friends on the reservation.  <br/>\nWe also have close friends whom we consider family who are Laguna Pueblo (mom is Laguna, dad is Spanish, actually).  Apache and Pueblo traditions are very different.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t know as much about the traditions of the other Native peoples in the US as I do Apache and Pueblo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would search online for the specific festival that you will be attending.  Since it is a festival, there will probably be more stereotypical images present than usual.  Many may be in full ceremonial clothing.  I have met people though, who came to the southwest truly expecting all indians they met to be wearing deerskin dresses and feathers.    <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a website that gives a history of the Mescalero:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.innofthemountaingods.com/mescalerohistory1.asp&lt;http://www.innofthemountaingods.com/mescalerohistory1.asp\">http://www.innofthemountaingods.com/mescalerohistory1.asp&lt;http://www.innofthemountaingods.com/mescalerohistory1.asp</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here is a website with some info about the Laguna and other Pueblos:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html&lt;http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html\">http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html&lt;http://www.indianpueblo.org/19pueblos/laguna.html</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe library should have children&#39;s stories by Native American authors, and about their beliefs and traditional life.

Chamille stopped being really interested in TV a few years<br/>\nback, about age 11 or so.

Only on very few<br/>\noccasions have my kids sat down on the couch to watch something<br/>\npurposeful without doing other things, and in those cases, it&#39;s usually<br/>\nthe whole family watching something together (Harry Potter movies<br/>\nespecially!).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Children know they can&#39;t say &quot;Hey, I changed<br/>\n&gt; my mind.

You feel there are some places  <br/>\nwhere parents need to draw the line to create harmony or safety  <br/>\nbecause the kids weren&#39;t making the right choices on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet the kids of radical unschoolers are given freedom and aren&#39;t  <br/>\nspending their lives on the couch in front of the big screen TV with  <br/>\na bowl of chips and a six pack of Coke. Why is that? Is it just  <br/>\nbecause our kids are naturally good so we get the luxury of trusting  <br/>\nthem to make the choices we would make for them?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, it&#39;s the other way around. We can trust them to make thoughtful  <br/>\nchoices because we&#39;ve trusted them to make thoughtful choices. People  <br/>\nwho begin with restrictions -- with kids they were sure had no  <br/>\nability to control themselves -- have found that by saying yes more  <br/>\nthat their kids do find balance in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nWatching a lot of TV isn&#39;t the result of TVs presence in the  house.  <br/>\nThat&#39;s giving the TV too much power. Your kids are more powerful than  <br/>\nthe TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that helped my daughter during her Cartoon Network years is  <br/>\nTiVo. When she knew she could watch her favorite programs anytime she  <br/>\nwanted, she watched a lot less. That feeling of being controlled by  <br/>\nthe programmers of the stations to have to be in front of the TV when  <br/>\nthey said she could watch her show kept her there waiting. The TiVo  <br/>\ngave her back the control. Also key is providing activities that are  <br/>\n*better* than TV. If kids are choosing TV because it&#39;s the least  <br/>\nboring thing to do, then why wouldn&#39;t they watch TV? It&#39;s just common  <br/>\nsense. And &quot;better&quot; needs to be better by their standards. Games and  <br/>\ntoys that they&#39;ve played with aren&#39;t better. (If they were better the  <br/>\nkids would be doing that instead.) It involves us being more  <br/>\nproactive at bringing things into their lives and getting them  <br/>\noutside the house to new things. (No one said unschooling was for  <br/>\nlazy people! ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n*And* it also means being sensitive to their needs. Sometimes they  <br/>\n*will* want to watch TV. And during the &quot;middle school&quot; years they  <br/>\nmay very likely want to watch a lot more TV than they did when they  <br/>\nwere younger (or will as teens). It&#39;s a transition period between kid  <br/>\ninterests and more grown up interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they  <br/>\n&gt; wish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he  <br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own. he is so used to  <br/>\n&gt; direction and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>It may just be who he is. While my daughter at 17 does now have  <br/>\npassions she can pick up, if I ask &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; at the  <br/>\nbeginning of the day she&#39;ll often have no idea. People who are even  <br/>\nkeeled can have problems picking from a wealth of choices when one  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t jump out (which it often doesn&#39;t for even keeled people.)  <br/>\nIt&#39;s just who they are. (I&#39;m the same way.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile she has things she loves doing on her own, drawing, writing,  <br/>\nguitar, other activities she likes to do because it&#39;s fun to do with  <br/>\nsomeone else. And often it&#39;s more fun when someone else does the  <br/>\nchoosing. I do give her the opportunity to voice her preference but I  <br/>\naccept that I&#39;m the one who will have to do most of the choosing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are a family who has chosen to steer away from TV<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Be clear. When you say &quot;we are a family who&quot; was this a decision  <br/>\nmutually agreed on by all? Or do you mean you and your husband decided?<br/>\n<br/>\nEven in a family decision, unless someone is really savvy about how  <br/>\nunequal power disrupts what looks like equality, family decisions  <br/>\naren&#39;t usually mutual. Children know they can&#39;t say &quot;Hey, I changed  <br/>\nmy mind. We&#39;re getting a TV today.&quot; They know they don&#39;t have that  <br/>\npower. They know that any power they have is loaned to them by their  <br/>\nparents and can be taken away at any time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is when radical unschoolers get accused of promoting TV as  <br/>\nthough families can&#39;t unschool without TV. No, what gets argued  is  <br/>\nthat unschooling can&#39;t flourish when kids lives are narrowed by  <br/>\nparents choices for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had kids who loved Chinese food and you hated it, would it  <br/>\nmake sense to ban it? There are unschooling vegetarian parents who  <br/>\nhave allowed their kids the freedom to explore a world of food that  <br/>\nincludes meat and make their own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had problems that seemed to come from TV, then this is the  <br/>\nplace to ask for help in making it work. There are plenty of people  <br/>\nhere who had the same experience. They didn&#39;t just shut their eyes  <br/>\nand ears to it and grit their teeth. They found ways to make it work.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a wealth of wisdom here to tap into that doesn&#39;t involve  <br/>\nparents banning something kids love.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; most boys at this age are into video games and the like<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why do you think that is?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost pregnant moms are into large intakes of calories. Why do  you  <br/>\nthink that is?<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are meeting some need they have at those times in their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were a truism that &quot;most boys at this age are into books&quot;,  <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t you be supplying books? Why wouldn&#39;t you supply video games?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know why you think so. I know the arguments against video games and  <br/>\nthe voices in your head that are saying video games (and resultant  <br/>\nbehavior) are bad. So I don&#39;t say this out of ignorance. I say it  <br/>\nfrom my personal experience and the experience of hundreds of radical  <br/>\nunschoolers (some of whom began with restrictions): the arguments are  <br/>\nwrong. There are hundreds of radically unschooled kids who have been  <br/>\ngiven the freedom to play games who are vibrant interesting teens who  <br/>\nare not addicted to video games. My daughter, too, played a lot of  <br/>\nvideo games and watched a lot of TV during the &quot;middle school&quot; years.  <br/>\nIt tapered off as her needs changed and today she barely has time for  <br/>\nvideo games or TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you trust that kids are getting something you don&#39;t understand  <br/>\nfor a need you can&#39;t see, then you can see better why video games and  <br/>\nTV aren&#39;t bad. If you join in and play and watch to get enough sense  <br/>\nof why they enjoy something, that not only helps you get the knot  <br/>\nfrom your stomach but helps forge a stronger relationship with them  <br/>\nbecause you&#39;re showing you care enough to find out who they are and  <br/>\nfind out about what they enjoy. There may be issues around video  <br/>\ngames and TV: arguing, testiness but those are side issues that can  <br/>\nbe dealt with separately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son was painting beautiful pictures but it made him testy  <br/>\nwith the family, would you take away his paints?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a thirteen yr old boy, who wants to be all grown up and not  <br/>\n&gt; have me make any choices for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This doesn&#39;t get any easier. Soon he will be making his own choices  <br/>\nand you won&#39;t be able to stop him.<br/>\n<br/>\nControl over kids is an illusion. We do have the opportunity to be an  <br/>\ninfluence in their lives but we blow that by trying to maintain the  <br/>\nillusion we can control them. Once they have the ability to walk out  <br/>\nthe door because they&#39;re fed up with being told what to do and what  <br/>\nnot to do, we&#39;ve lost even the illusion of control and have  <br/>\nsquandered our influence.

I&#39;m thinking of &quot;brainwashing&quot; type programming.  A kid who<br/>\nseems to not want anything, and has been told what to do by his parents,<br/>\nis a kid who has no idea what it&#39;s like to make decisions for himself. <br/>\nA kid who has been making their own decisions for a long time and seems<br/>\nto not want anything could be in a processing, or down time mode.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We are a family who has chosen to steer away from TV - since we have<br/>\n&gt; moved to Maine eight months ago we have not owned a Tv, and I do not<br/>\n&gt; forsee us getting one anytime soon.

That<br/>\ncan cause kids to feel really powerless in decision making if they are<br/>\nthwarted in their attempts to like something that the parents deem<br/>\nunfit, such as TV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you from first hand experience, having grown up in a TV free<br/>\nhouse, that my kids, with complete and free access to TV, seem much<br/>\nhappier about TV than I did when I was a kid and wished I could watch it<br/>\nand couldn&#39;t.  My husband and I opted not to do that to our kids.  Our 7<br/>\nyro watches a lot of TV and our 14 yro, watches very little, but used to<br/>\nwatch a lot when she was little.  Both our kids are happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We do watch movies, and have a radio<br/>\n&gt; and computer.. but most boys at this age are into video games and the<br/>\n&gt; like.

Or do you let them choose when they want to help and when<br/>\n&gt; they want to veg? How do you do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Since I&#39;m the parent, I do the daily housework.  They choose when they<br/>\nwant to help.  Neither of my kids have vegged out.  If they are spending<br/>\nmore time inactively, it&#39;s because they are tired or sick or need rest. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not an either/or where they choose to work or vegg.  They don&#39;t do<br/>\neither of those things usually.  They are usually involved in their own<br/>\nprojects.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Chamille, now 14, was little, we did a quick pick up every night,<br/>\nbut it wasn&#39;t mandatory and we did it together.  I let that go with<br/>\nMargaux, now 7, because she plays differently, in an ongoing fashion,<br/>\nwhere things can&#39;t be easily put away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day Chamille did all the dishes while my husband and I were<br/>\nout, it was a sweet surprise for us to come home to.  She routinely<br/>\ncleans the bathroom that she uses without anyone asking.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have a thirteen yr old boy, who wants to be all grown up and not<br/>\n&gt; have me make any choices for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps you are making the wrong choices for him.  Perhaps he needs real<br/>\nchoices that directly affect his life, like wether or not he wants to<br/>\nwatch TV or play video games, without having his parents place judgement<br/>\non those choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they<br/>\n&gt; wish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own. he is so used to<br/>\n&gt; direction and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is directly because you&#39;ve told him what to feel, and think about<br/>\nsome very basic things in his life.  Is he free to say what he really<br/>\nthinks and do what he really wants to do, without judgement?  Until he<br/>\nis allowed this, he will feel powerless and act accordingly.  He needs<br/>\nto be able to make real choices for himself, not arbitrary, &quot;what do you<br/>\nwant to do in your spare time?&quot; kind of choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraditional parenting tells people to limit and control what their kids<br/>\ndo, for their own good.  The problem is, that once they turn 13 or so,<br/>\nthey want some more control and less limits, and they&#39;ll get it<br/>\neventually because kids grow up and move out.  How do you want that<br/>\nprocess to look?  Do you want a continuous struggle until he leaves, or<br/>\ndo you want to change the dynamics?  This is a natural part of life,<br/>\ngaining more independence, more choices, and bigger thinking.  As a<br/>\nparent, you can either embrace that and move with it, or try to block<br/>\nit.  This can happen naturally and a lot of parents can&#39;t see that<br/>\nbecause our world around us is telling parents to control and limit our<br/>\nkids for their protection, own good, etc.  It doesn&#39;t have to be that<br/>\nway!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is sooo much nicer to help your kids grow into adulthood with mutual<br/>\nrespect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am confused as to how to unschool and keep records that will be<br/>\n&gt; acceptable to the state... and how to help my kids really be who they<br/>\n&gt; are meant to be - NOT according to me!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Some states have more difficult regulations to follow, but there are<br/>\nunschoolers in every state.

I have a nine yr old girl who would <br/>\ndo anything to help mommy, and a seven yr old boy who loves to learn <br/>\noutside all by himself, a four year old who thinks she IS the boss of <br/>\nthe whole world, and a two yr old boy who is close behind...  <br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen many many benefits to letting my children learn as they <br/>\nwish - but it is a great challenge with my thirteen year old, as he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to go find something on his own.  he is so used to <br/>\ndirection and doesn&#39;t function well with &quot;what do YOU want to do?&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am confused as to how to unschool and keep records that will be <br/>\nacceptable to the state... and how to help my kids really be who they <br/>\nare meant to be - NOT according to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you can help?</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39910,"nextTopicId":39945}}
