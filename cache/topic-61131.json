Effie has always been very sensitive and hates having anyone touch her hair, but also loves it long, a combo that is torture for me as observer! I have to do a lot of deep breathing as clothing is another one of her issues, so often her clothes are very well worn, shall we say, as well. Clean and tidy is not our MO! But this is my issue, though I will share it with her gently when we are going to be somewhere I think her appearance matters a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, by the time Effie asks me to untangle her hair it is often one huge tangle - HUGE. I have never cut it, I firmly believe just about any tangle will fall to perseverance and a lot of conditioner applied correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how we do it: She lies flat in the bath with water up to her ears and leans back to totally soak her head. While it is under and wet she and I both work to pull apart and loosen the worst tangles. Then she sits up and we squeeze it out. Then she lies back down and we repeat all that. Something about the 2nd moisten gets more water inside the tangles and allows the conditioner (next step) to get in better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we get out and douse her tangle with cheap water soluble conditioner. And I mean douse. It should be visible throughout the hair.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we go to wherever she has set up her distraction (computer, movie, xbox, whatever) and I work with my fingers to gently pull apart the tangles - I pull each bit in all directions and just keep pulling round and round till something loosens. I don&#39;t use a brush until it is almost completely finished, it is all pulling with my fingers in every direction. When I am really stuck I will rip a tangle apart, taking care not to pull or hurt her scalp. I keep a spray bottle of water and extra conditioner handy to remoisten when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we brush. Usually I have to stop and do more fingers as there is almost always some tiny tangle at the base of her neck or somewhere that I missed and is catching in the brush.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we go back to the bathroom and I put some shampoo on her scalp - I leave the conditioner in her hair, and don&#39;t put any shampoo anywhere except the hair right at her head - the conditioner on the ends keeps them from getting tangled again while we wash the upper bits. I gently scrub her head a bit. Then she gets back in the bath water (we heat it up a bit) and we swish out as much of the shampoo/conditioner as we can, being careful not to make more tangles.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we turn on the shower and rinse properly. Then I condition the ends of her hair (not usually her scalp, just the lower bits) and finger out any tangles, and we rinse again, and then gently dry, again taking care not to tangle it at all. She is very sensitive to odor, so isn&#39;t keen on leave-in conditioner, and sometimes leave-ins can make tangles worse because the hair is stickier from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has taken us years to find a system that works well for us, for me to let go enough, for her to mature enough, for us to figure out the fastest least painful way to untangle, but now we rarely have issues about hair. She tells me when she is ready to do it. I ask her to wear a hat or hoodie or tie it back if I think we are going somewhere it will matter. She will often just brush the very top layer so it looks untangled on the surface if we are going somewhere and she is wanting it to look fancier. She has a nice selection of hats!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some part of our experience helps someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Gillian<br/>\nand Craig of Effie (11) and Fergus (7)<br/>\nVictoria BC Canada</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":454093105,"authorName":"lalow","from":"&quot;lalow&quot; &lt;lalougor@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: OT: Unschooling hair","postDate":"1305084970","msgId":61144,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlxZDA3YSs2NW42QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDdERDE2MDA5LTQ1RTMtNDFFMy1COTIzLTYzNzMyMjY4QjVFRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":61142,"nextInTopic":61147,"prevInTime":61143,"nextInTime":61145,"topicId":61131,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My daughter is African American too.

She has very very tight thick hair as well.  Even if I comb it out every day it is very tangled and takes 20 minutes to get most of the tangles out (not all).    We have thought about locs, but after discussing that she might have to cut her hair pretty much off when she tires of them she decided no.. But that might be an idea.  I condition her hair with olive oil and comb it out with the oil in it.  She likes to have hers braided so we keep it that way a lot.  If I do them they last a week or so.  If I hire someone they last 2 or so weeks.

It looks a bit like &quot;corn braids&quot; but isn&#39;t nearly as heavy as all those beads, nor does it take as long. Best of all, even if you have to cut through mats to plait the hair, it still works and still looks nice. The first time I got Mo a new video game so she&#39;d have something else to focus on for an hour while I did a whole bunch of braids, after that I could do one or two here and there. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll I did was cut lengths of ribbon twice as long as the chunk of hair to braid, double over the ribbon and braid the hair in as the third strand. Very elegant and you can add more ribbon at the top as it grows out - either the same or a different color for pizzazz. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow she&#39;s wanting to let it grow out and I&#39;m working on being okay with that - hair&#39;s probably the one area where I still have to bite my tongue.<br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] OT: Unschooling hair","postDate":"1304977026","msgId":61133,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzNzk3NC45NTk2Ny5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDdERDE2MDA5LTQ1RTMtNDFFMy1COTIzLTYzNzMyMjY4QjVFRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDdERDE2MDA5LTQ1RTMtNDFFMy1COTIzLTYzNzMyMjY4QjVFRUBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":61132,"nextInTopic":61134,"prevInTime":61132,"nextInTime":61134,"topicId":61131,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"would she be interested in videos about how to care and style her type of hair?

She has the absolute curliest hair on the planet; mine is stick-straight--and about 1/4-1/2&quot; long since I recently finished chemo.  My daughter (age 11) hasn&#39;t wanted her hair messed with lately, other than the occasional comb.  It is quickly becoming more and more tangled to the point where it&#39;s actually matted.  She doesn&#39;t want me to take her anywhere to have someone work on it.  I have tried various conditioners to soften and detangle it, without much luck.  I don&#39;t want to tell her she *has to* let me do something with it because that goes against my parenting philosophy and I believe it will damage the trust she has in me.  But I worry that her hair will soon reach the point where it will have to be cut down to almost nothing because it is so badly matted.  Any ideas, thoughts, input?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nCarol</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61139,"nextTopicId":61086}}
