It is so much easier to tape and find<br/>\nthe shows again to watch then using a vcr. You can even start<br/>\nwatching a show from the beginning while it is still taping.

We just don&#39;t<br/>\nschedule things for early in the mornings -- the beauty of homeschooling!!<br/>\nMy dd and I usually get to bed anywhere from 9-11pm, and my dh usually gets<br/>\nto bed by 1am.  These days we are all sleeping in late.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually get sleepy before my dd.  She still isn&#39;t willing to play by<br/>\nherself, so she often will decide to come to bed with me.  Sometimes, when<br/>\nshe does she ends up falling asleep really really quickly.  Sometimes we<br/>\nend up talking and giggling far longer than I would have, but I&#39;m still OK<br/>\nand having fun.  Sometimes I&#39;m just so wiped out that I need to get to<br/>\nsleep, and if she really isn&#39;t ready to sleep then we try to come up with<br/>\nsome option that will work for both of us... I may try to fall asleep on<br/>\nthe couch, she may agree to get up and play in her room, she may talk her<br/>\nDad into not working for awhile.  You can&#39;t really predict what it will be<br/>\nlike each and every day, and that&#39;s OK too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that is really important is for me to remember myself, and to go<br/>\nto bed before I go over the edge.  I&#39;m no fun to be around when I&#39;m too<br/>\ntired.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dh and I spend time together during the day.  We like this so much<br/>\nbetter, because we are each awake ;-)  It&#39;s much easier for our dd to find<br/>\nsomething to do for awhile compared to late in the evening, and the only<br/>\nthing we ask is that she not come into our room and interrupt us.  She<br/>\nwould prefer to be with us rather than to be alone, but this is one choice<br/>\nthat I&#39;m not willing to give her.  We don&#39;t require that she stay in one<br/>\nroom, or do any one thing, just that she give us our privacy.  We&#39;re really<br/>\nlucky that we can do this (my dh works from home most of the time), but<br/>\neven so I&#39;d probably do the same thing in the early evenings if we didn&#39;t<br/>\nhave the daytime hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t get TV reception, and watched so little TV that it&#39;s not cost<br/>\neffective to pay for satellite.  We do get Netflix movies, and mix them up<br/>\nso sometimes our dd watches something she wants in one room and my dh and I<br/>\nwatch something else in another room.  If our dd comes in we don&#39;t worry<br/>\nabout it -- if she doesn&#39;t like it she will tell us, and it&#39;s so easy to<br/>\njust pause a movie.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things that have worked in the past, in case you need some other<br/>\nideas:  my dd and I have often gone to sleep really early, say 8-9pm, I<br/>\nsleep for several hours, get up around 11pm and then spend some time with<br/>\nmy dh.  Or, either my dh or I would awake in the really early morning hours<br/>\nand we&#39;d decide to get up to spend some time then, then both go back to<br/>\nsleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNamaste<br/>\n--bc--<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Bedtimes","postDate":"1072228050","msgId":17686,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1Mi4yODg1MmY4NS4yZDFhNDBkMkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":17683,"nextInTopic":17689,"prevInTime":17685,"nextInTime":17687,"topicId":17683,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 12/23/2003 5:24:56 PM Mountain Standard Time, sanfrancesco@cox.net writes: -=-Dh and I can t watch our normal programming because it s not","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-981944039\">In a message dated 12/23/2003 5:24:56 PM Mountain Standard Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sanfrancesco@...\">sanfrancesco@...</a> writes:<br/>\n-=-Dh and I can&#39;t watch our normal programming because it&#39;s not something we&#39;d<br/>\nnecessarily want them to watch it.-=-<br/>\nRecord and watch it later.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-if I let them just get &quot;sleepy&quot; - . ..-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to go to sleep when you&#39;re not sleepy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":94849622,"authorName":"Claudia Bartoli-McKinney, FTI","from":"&quot;Claudia Bartoli-McKinney, FTI&quot; &lt;sanfrancesco@...&gt;","profile":"sr_piomaria","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Bedtimes","postDate":"1072206412","msgId":17683,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNGRTg5MjRDLjAwMDAwOC4wNDE4OEB5b3VyLWl6MHJsa3kzMnU+","referencesHeader":"PDFkMC4xNjg4MTU2MC4yZDE5YzJjZEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":17686,"prevInTime":17682,"nextInTime":17684,"topicId":17683,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi everyone, I am finding this thread interesting and hoping to hear what other parents\nhave to say about this.

But they didn&#39;t need my help to say &quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; because every \r<br/>\nsingle night, they went to sleep at some point, when they were sleepy.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;you being there probably actually \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nkeeps them from sleeping well&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not a family bed advocate. &lt;g&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen babies sleep with their parents, it can be longer before they want to \r<br/>\nsleep alone.  Mine all want to sleep alone now, but there were times for all<br/>\nof \r<br/>\nthem when they preferred to sleep with someone else.  Because they had \r<br/>\nchoices, we know they are sleeping alone now from choice, not because they<br/>\ngave up or \r<br/>\nbecause they resent us and want us away from them.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;It is not against the unschooling \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ntrain of thought to insist that your children be in their rooms by a \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\ncertain time each night.&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt might be against the attachment parenting train of thought, and for some \r<br/>\nfamilies there&#39;s not a difference.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;If he is not ready \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nby 7:30 then no stories and he has to put himself to bed and we do \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nonly hugs and kisses&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat&#39;s more punitive than our family would ever have been comfortable with. <br/>\n\r<br/>\nThat seems plainly &quot;training,&quot; and not offering choices in the most open, \r<br/>\npositive way.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Perhaps letting them \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nunderstand how to put themselves to sleep is a gift you could give \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nthem now, and the gift to your family would be a stronger \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nrelationship between you and your dh. &gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy kids don&#39;t &quot;put themselves to sleep.&quot;  Neither do I.  I fall asleep happy<br/>\n \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nWhen I was little, going to bed was often an unhappy thing, a \r<br/>\nfeeling-mom-is-mean thing, a scary thing, and a punitive-feeling thing.  I<br/>\nnever wanted that \r<br/>\nfor my children, and they&#39;ve never had it.  Yet they sleep!\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nAll my children put together have had fewer nightmares than I had in any \r<br/>\nsingle year of my childhood from the time I was seven or so.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Remember that freedom is no \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nlonger freedom when it infringes on the rights of others.&gt;&gt;\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nIt has never seemed fair to me when parents claim many more freedoms than \r<br/>\ntheir children have.  Adult understanding and compassion should be larger by<br/>\nfar \r<br/>\nthan child-understanding and compassion.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSandra\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nYahoo!
