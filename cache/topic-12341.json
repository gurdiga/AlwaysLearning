My maternal<br/>\ngrandmother had been called Granna, because my oldest cousin hadn&#39;t been<br/>\nable to say grandma.  I decided to go with that.  When Skye was first<br/>\nlearning to talk, she called me Bumma.  I wasn&#39;t exactly crazy about that,<br/>\nbut she grew out of it.  &lt;g&gt;  The second one is talking now, and the closest<br/>\nhe can come is Yah-yah.  I like that.  And my sister just told me that it&#39;s<br/>\nactually Greek for grandma.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband (the step-grandpa) chose Poppy, which is what he called his dad.<br/>\nHis parents are Grandma Rain (Irene) and Grandpa Silly (He *is* silly, at<br/>\nleast around the kids.)  My ex chose to be called Grandpappy, but Skye<br/>\ncouldn&#39;t say that and shortened it to Happy.  Happy he still is, which is<br/>\nquite ironic.  A less happy man I&#39;ve yet to know.  &lt;g&gt;  Her other bio<br/>\ngrandma is just Trish, and my ex mil (her great grandma) was Grandma Down<br/>\nthe Road for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy German dad had already died by the time I had kids, but my mother (who<br/>\nwasn&#39;t German) agreed to be called Oma to keep the German tradition going.<br/>\n(Although it actually wasn&#39;t a tradition in my family.  My grandparents were<br/>\ncalled Mutti and Vati, which are the German words for Mommy and Daddy, by<br/>\nalmost everyone who knew them well.  So did we, though I never knew why.)<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":45073,"authorName":"amycats2@aol.com","from":"amycats2@...","profile":"amycats2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Granny","postDate":"1045595199","msgId":12343,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2LjJhNGRhNDVlLjJiODNkZTNmQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":12341,"nextInTopic":12344,"prevInTime":12342,"nextInTime":12344,"topicId":12341,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 2/18/2003 1:57:19 PM Eastern Standard Time, ...
