And sometimes stepping in with confidence and a firm tone will help someone (child or adult) remember which choices are the better ones. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: What do you do when your spouse doesn&#39;t get it?","postDate":"1305398500","msgId":61198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQyMTc0NC42OTkxNC5xbUB3ZWI4MTUwNi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGlxbHFoaSsxMG9ndUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlxbGNwditmcHV2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8aXFscWhpKzEwb2d1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61197,"nextInTopic":61201,"prevInTime":61197,"nextInTime":61199,"topicId":61148,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I speak sternly to him, he gets upset and often responds by yelling and it can often spiral out of control. -=-=-=-   When I tell my child something like ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1621318148\">&quot;I speak sternly to him, he gets upset and often responds by yelling and it can often spiral out of control.&quot;<br/>\n-=-=-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nWhen I tell my child something like &quot; Hey that is not a nice way to talk to ...&quot;  I say it in a &quot;matter of fact&quot; voice not a soft &quot;sing songy&quot; voice.<br/>\nMaybe you are reading that a &quot;stern&quot; voice is loud or angry but that is not what I am saying. <br/>\nNot that sometimes I don&#39;t use a louder   sterner voice if necessary  to stop somthing  but those are very rarely used or needed.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: What do you do when your spouse doesn&#39;t get it?","postDate":"1305397791","msgId":61197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3ODg2MS4zMjQzNS5xbUB3ZWI2MDguYml6Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGlxbHFoaSsxMG9ndUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlxbHFoaSsxMG9ndUBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":61195,"nextInTopic":61198,"prevInTime":61196,"nextInTime":61198,"topicId":61148,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Maybe I am misunderstanding, but I am sort of getting the feeling that some feel it is wrong to not be stern when addressing an issue of rudeness?

He is almost always saying this to my husband. He may have said these things to me too but I can&#39;t recall any specifically. All I can think of is that in the past my husband wanted more limits on things like computer games and certain foods and we did that for a long time. About a month ago we started talking about it again and agreed to let go of those limits and try another way. But I wonder if Josh has picked up on it that dad has a harder time saying yes than mom? We&#39;ve never presented it as a daddy vs. mommy thing, but it is something we have talked about privately and I was more ready to say yes while he was more unsure about it. My husband now wants to say yes and he is saying yes, but I guess sometimes he is a bit reluctant about that and Josh probably picks up on that.  Maybe Josh is reacting to that in some way, asserting that he gets to make that choice? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems strange that now that he isn&#39;t being told what to do in these areas, he is saying things like &quot;don&#39;t tell me what to do&quot;, though maybe that is normal when going through a transition like this? It is not like we sat him down and said, &quot;hey, you can now eat whatever your want and do whatever you want!&quot; It&#39;s not something he&#39;s heard from us directly at all. We just decided that we would start saying yes to these things and not make a big to-do about it all. Those types of statements definitely have my husband questioning whether we should start limiting those things again because of these kinds of responses. Sometimes he feels like Josh&#39;s behavior has gotten a lot worse since we gave up those limits (like him saying those kinds of rude things, or yelling at us and he does yell at both of us, not just my husband). I have encouraged him to give it more time because we had those limits for so long that it is going to take a while to work this all out, and he is willing but having a hard time with it (and it is hard for me to, to see him talk that way to anyone but especially his dad). I have been trying to point out specific examples to him to show him some of the positive things happening since we let go of those limits since he doesn&#39;t get to be home all day and doesn&#39;t always get to see that part of it and I know that has been helpful to him. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I think it would be helpful to your husband if you acknowledged that your son is being rude and that you want to help him do better. Then you can be on the same team with your husband and figure out ways to support your child. He doesn&#39;t want an adversarial relationship with his dad, I&#39;m sure, and it won&#39;t be just his dad who reacts negatively to him if he is rude in his responses.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;m sure I need to be better at this. I do talk to him about how saying things like that is rude, and we talk about treating each other kindly and gently. Maybe I do so too hesitantly? When I talk to him about these things I try to bring him in close, hugging or holding him if he wants and talk to him quietly about what he has said and talking about how it might make another person feel, etc. I think sometimes my husband wants a more firm response, something like, &quot;Stop being rude, don&#39;t talk to your father that way,&quot; etc. So when I pull my son into my lap and say something instead of standing up and giving a more firm response, he feels like I am coddling our son instead of correcting him--does that make sense? I think a lot of it has to do with tone of voice as well.

Just like your son, your husband is doing his best - and he doesn&#39;t Have a lot of warm fuzzy parenting skills just yet, so his best is going to lag a bit even if he&#39;s totally excited about the idea of unschooling on a theoretical level. Most dads don&#39;t start out totally excited, though - more often they start out cautious and a bit suspicious, not sure they buy all this hoo-haa about peace and love. He needs time and support. He needs to see how things work for you and think about how he can do something similar. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my kids were younger and George liked the idea of unschooling in theory, I&#39;d tell him stories of my day - what worked, what didn&#39;t, what was something fun we did, what flopped utterly... normal sorts of stories but the point was to make sure I told him something regularly. He wasn&#39;t getting the hours and hours of experience I was getting (in those days he worked outside the home, now I do) but he was able to think about situations outside the pressure of the moment, too, and there&#39;s an advantage to that. He seemed to learn very slowly at first and then everything clicked. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt; For example, a few days ago my son (who is 5) was asking if some words rhymed, something like bug and book. My husband says no, they don&#39;t. My son replies with, &quot;Yes, they do. How do you know?<br/>\n </span></blockquote>******************<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes its possible to diffuse a situation like that if you&#39;re right there - make a point about alliteration that lets them both save a bit of face, for instance, or call your son away with the remark that daddy&#39;s not awake enough yet, but you&#39;ll be happy to play a rhyming game. How that works is going to be about personalities, but also about agreements you and your husband have about how to deal with these kinds of situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helped me and George to talk about &quot;coming to the rescue&quot; - when George is being an ass he wants me to rescue him (and whichever kid) but he doesn&#39;t want to be made to feel bad at the same time. He Knows things aren&#39;t going well and wants help! I feel the same way if I&#39;m floundering around, stuffing my food deeper into my mouth at every moment or getting overly emotional - I want him to come bail me out. <br/>\nHaving a conversation about helping each other when we&#39;re obviously not having a great moment helped us both navigate thsoe kinds of situations, so it Feels like a rescue, not an implied criticism of the other&#39;s parenting. <br/>\n <br/>\nHaving a partner who is even theoretically on board with unschooling is a boon! Be sure you&#39;re letting him know you appreciate him and his hard work, both in terms of supporting you financially and also supporting your efforts, even if his support is still imperfect. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: What do you do when your spouse doesn&#39;t get it?","postDate":"1305290676","msgId":61155,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI1NDIyNC41MzM3MS5xbUB3ZWI4NzMxNS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDU4MDhCNUNFLTQ2N0EtNDBEQS05Rjg4LTZEMDU2NkU1OTdGMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGlxajVsbityNmZwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NTgwOEI1Q0UtNDY3QS00MERBLTlGODgtNkQwNTY2RTU5N0YwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":61154,"nextInTopic":61158,"prevInTime":61154,"nextInTime":61156,"topicId":61148,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m going to talk to my husband about your suggestion to ask if he is tired and recognizing that he is being less giving than usual.-=- WRONG!

I like the idea of giving them each one suggestion and then dropping it. It is also good to hear someone say that if a conversation goes bad, it is often better to let it slide. That is usually what I do these days, and then if I feel the need to say something I talk to DH privately later on. But I guess sometimes I feel bad. I have this urge to defend my son when I feel like he is being treated badly, but that definitely sets up an antagonistic relationship with my husband which I don&#39;t want to do at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do often give a light response, like what you mentioned. Sometimes this really bothers my husband because he feels like I am dismissing the situation and &quot;letting&quot; my son be rude to him. Really I am trying to keep the moment light so that we can discuss whatever is happening without the conversation heading downhill very quickly. I want to be able to talk to my son when he says something rude or unkind, and for him keeping it light really does help. If I jump in immediately by telling my son that is a rude response, the conversation quickly spirals downward. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Your son was wrong, bug and book don&#39;t rhyme.

It is just one thing that happened recently that is a typical example of something we deal with a lot. I am sorry if I gave the impression that I think he is not a good parent. I do think my husband is a good dad and husband. That is also why I mentioned that he was very tired at the time because I knew that was affecting how he responded. I also know he has a lot to overcome with how he was raised (when we got married he still had the belt he was whipped with as a child, and at the time it was like a badge of honor for him). I know that I definitely have my moments where I use a tone I don&#39;t like with my son or my husband. I know I am not the parent I would like to be either. I know we are both working on this together. I am just looking for some advice on how to help my husband and my son and our relationship as a family. I have definitely learned that it is not the moment to jump in and tell my husband what he is doing wrong. My kids are young and this is new to me too (I wasn&#39;t raised quite the way my husband was, but still came from an authoritarian/punishment family) so I am still learning. I am really trying to be gentle with him and myself as we learn and figure this stuff out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for the suggestion to jump in very early with something like, &quot;bug and hug,&quot; rhyme and sweep him away. I do think that would be a good way to jump in and help and avoid the situation escalating. I sort of tried to do that this time, but I probably waited too long to do so, and hadn&#39;t thought about sweeping him away in a hug in that way, which would have helped my husband since I could recognize that he was tired and that was a big part of why he was responding that way. Instead I gave some examples of things that rhymed and then examples of more b-words/alliteration and he started responded with more b-words and laughing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometime during this my DH walked out of the room (again, I think because he gets upset when I make light of a situation instead of &quot;disciplining&quot; my son about how he treated his dad? I&#39;m still not sure what to do with that, because my husband doesn&#39;t agree with punishments so I&#39;m not sure what he expects. If I ask him what he wants me to do or how he would like me to respond to these situations (later! not right at that moment) he doesn&#39;t have suggestions for me.  He wants me to do something, but he isn&#39;t sure what. Past talking to my son about how to treat people kindly and doing my best to model that, what do I do? There&#39;s another question for everyone!.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to talk to my husband about your suggestion to ask if he is tired and recognizing that he is being less giving than usual. I think that would be helpful for both of us to do with each other. I definitely like of us working together to change the flow, check the tension, and move toward a moment of love and affection. That is definitely what I want to do and have been trying to do, but I&#39;m not always sure how to do it. Your suggestions are helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to both of you!

My husband says no, they don&#39;t. My son replies with, &quot;Yes, they do. How do you know? You don&#39;t know!&quot; My husband starts to get frustrated (partly because it was really early in the morning, he was tired and cranky to begin with, and partly because my son says that kind of thing a lot lately and I&#39;ve noticed that it really triggers my husband to hear his 5 year old say &quot;you don&#39;t know!&quot;). So he says something like yes, I do know, my son says no you don&#39;t, how do you know, etc. Until finally my husband says, &quot;Because I&#39;m an adult.&quot; Even before that final line, his tone during the whole conversation was so authoritarian and harsh that it just made me cringe. Instead of really listening to him and responding to his question and working through it with him, he wanted to throw one word final answers at him and was mad when our son didn&#39;t get it and didn&#39;t accept his word as the answer without explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seemed so anti-everything we have always talked about in regards to how we treat our children and what we want for our family. It was so disrespectful to our son as a person. I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to explain here all the things I felt were so wrong about that conversation, but I do want to know how others would deal with this situation. Typically if I get involved in the moment, or try to direct the conversation in another way it leads to my husband and I fighting (part of me feels like this is okay sometimes, people fight--but part of me feels like our arguments escalate quickly and it doesn&#39;t feel like a very healthy thing to do in front of our children). On the other hand, I feel like staying out of it isn&#39;t very good for my son either and it breaks my heart to watch this kind of thing go on. Usually I try to talk to DH about it later, and after defending himself for a while he usually seems to get it, and I can tell he is really trying--but when he is frustrated or tired he reverts back to this kind of behavior. I definitely think he feels like he is owed something, like his children must respect him and listen to him and obey him (because that&#39;s how his parents treated him and gosh darn it, it&#39;s his turn now!). He knows logically that this isn&#39;t right or true, but in the moment he really struggles to live differently and to choose to react in a different way than his own parents did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I am just wondering if other people deal with this and how they deal with it, what do you do when your spouse doesn&#39;t get it?
