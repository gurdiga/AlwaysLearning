You also narrow your own perception to the <br/>\npoint that you miss a great deal of what your child is really <br/>\nexperiencing and learning. For example, if you are making cookies <br/>\nand *you* are thinking &quot;aha! she&#39;s learning about meansurement!&quot; you <br/>\nmight miss or disregard the way she explores the texture of the <br/>\ndough. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I see her <br/>\n&gt; friends learning to add things like 23+6 and it scares me that <br/>\n </span></blockquote>what <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; if she is 15 and still has to count on her fingers? <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would that be a tragedy?
