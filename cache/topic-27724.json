My middle dd age 16 started GED classes last week. She was mostly unschooled except for a few unit studies yrs ago, when I was still trying to wrap my mind around unschooling. I think its cool that she chose to do this on her own and has done amazingly well considering she had never taken a test in her life. In the placement tests she scored way high in language and not so well in math.. as she expected. But she is confident that she will do fine, even with math, after a few classes. My oldest dd now 22, took the GED when she was 18 and scored quite high. She was the one who put up with the most of my &#39;school-at-home&#39; ideas. I wonder what my totally unschooled, soon to be 12 yo dd will decide? Its been quite an adventure, learning to let go and to trust them. I still have my moments, but thankfully they are far and few between these days.

(Just thinking, at this point.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can work at any job at the grocery store, not just &quot;courtesy  <br/>\nclerk&quot; (bagging and cart retrieval and that).  Several departments  <br/>\nhave been courting and flirting since he first went to work there.   <br/>\nHe can&#39;t be a checker yet because he can&#39;t sell liquor, and he  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to work stocking because they work overnight.  He might  <br/>\nnot even stay there, but he knows they&#39;ll might be pressing him to  <br/>\n&quot;move up.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly was offered a good babysitting job.  Well, the offer was  <br/>\npublic, and I wrote and said she might be interested, and the mom was  <br/>\nreally happy about that, because the older child knows and really  <br/>\nlikes Holly.  It will be nearly $100 a week, when it gets going, and  <br/>\nlast to May.   There&#39;s a toddler involved, and Holly really likes  <br/>\nbeing around littler children (being a youngest, being 15).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo everyone was saying &quot;Hey, Holly&#39;s got a job! on Satuday.<br/>\n<br/>\nLate that night, really late, I was playing Guitar Hero with Kirby  <br/>\nand he said &quot;I got a call back from Client Logic.&quot;   Client Logic  <br/>\ndoes customer support for World of Warcraft and Tivo and something or  <br/>\nother else, I forget.  I asked what they said, and he said to come to  <br/>\norientation on Monday.   No interview?  Apparently not.   Why didn&#39;t  <br/>\nyou say so earlier?  Everyone was excited about Holly&#39;s job and he  <br/>\nfigured he&#39;d just wait.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was a very sweet thing for him to do, to let the excitement of  <br/>\nthe day be all hers, for her first job.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty took a week off from work because Madelyn is visiting here from  <br/>\nSeattle.
