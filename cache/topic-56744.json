Many places where I could have chosen to live, there&#39;s a<br/>\nHead Start kindergarten program starting kids at school at 4 years of<br/>\nage. It&#39;s supposed to give qualifying kids an extra hand up. It isn&#39;t<br/>\nfree for all kids though, just for people who can&#39;t afford<br/>\nkindergarten. So if your family is in that qualifying income bracket,<br/>\nit looks a lot like a requirement, even when it isn&#39;t an official one.<br/>\n And if you&#39;re obviously NOT in that income bracket and you can afford<br/>\nto pay for kindergarten, the option not to send a child to<br/>\nkindergarten seems marginal and pro-school people are gonna ask why<br/>\nparents are not allowing their kids to go to kindergarten if they can<br/>\nafford it. The big question parents get is why would a parent NOT want<br/>\nto??<br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t free to all and may never be but lots of people see education<br/>\n(in other words-- school) as a universal right. The pressure to send<br/>\nkids to school starts very early in the US with a school system not<br/>\ndoing well internationally and the onus to improve not falling<br/>\nsquarely on the system alone but also on children to attend school<br/>\nmore and earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s very good reason for parents to understand unschooling as early<br/>\nin the game as possible and do it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFour is still very young, a baby to me, and it wasn&#39;t until just<br/>\nrecently that Karl turned 7 and became interested in specific bits of<br/>\ninfo to talk about. Before that, it was lots of storytelling and<br/>\nplayacting and very little conscious gathering of info or talking<br/>\nabout it. Some but not much. And there&#39;s still a lot of unconsciously<br/>\nbeing awash in a sea of ideas. When Karl was 3 and 4, he loved playing<br/>\nReader Rabbit and I played together with him. Lots of times he skipped<br/>\nthings he didn&#39;t know and sometimes he asked me to answer parts for<br/>\nhim. I know that he was picking up ideas from what we did. We played<br/>\nStarfall together and it was fun to click the words and so they could<br/>\nread themselves and sometimes sing about themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame thing with watching old Sesame Street episodes on Youtube where<br/>\nthe actors name the letters hanging in midair and also have side<br/>\nconversations about all kinds of other things that I would not<br/>\nnecessarily call academic. For instance, there was a breastfeeding<br/>\nskit and Karl could easily relate to that as a matter of course, and<br/>\nwas what I would call confirmation of what he had experienced himself<br/>\nfirsthand. For another kid, who either doesn&#39;t remember breastfeeding<br/>\nor who wasn&#39;t breastfed, that skit could be new, in other words, where<br/>\ninformation to learn from is provided.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t be afraid to show and tell if the child/ren want to watch and<br/>\nlisten. Do give information and learning will go on. Karl and I were<br/>\nin a small local little restaurant and in the past he has gone up to<br/>\nthe register with the bill and money to pay for the meal. Instead of<br/>\nasking him in words, I drew on a napkin a stick figure story of him<br/>\npaying for the meal. He was curious to see what would come next,<br/>\nwatched as I drew, said &quot;Oh ok!&quot; and then I gave him the money/bill<br/>\nand away he went. Later, he wanted me to draw another story with him<br/>\nfor showing his dad. I also have a note program in my PDA and Karl<br/>\ndictates stories sometimes as we&#39;re settling in to sleep. There&#39;s all<br/>\nkinds of ways to keep the learning flowing and keep it mixed up and<br/>\nfun and never look to curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nEducational goals in the school system carry over from year to year,<br/>\nrepeating for reinforcement of info and gradually adding to repeated<br/>\nmaterial from previous grades.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith unschooling, a huge advantage is lots of information that&#39;s very<br/>\ncomprehensive without resorting to forced repetition of concepts so<br/>\nthat a child can leisurely put ideas into the place it needs to go for<br/>\nhim/her. The objective for unschooling is simply to keep the learning<br/>\nflowing.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh I hope there aren&#39;t many people who think unschooling is anti-learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 8/9/10, aldq75 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:aldq75@...\">aldq75@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; More and more U.S. states require kindergarten now, and when and where free<br/>\n&gt; public schooling starts in ANY jurisdiction and a parent opts<br/>\n&gt; out, I think that&#39;s time to start saying &quot;we&#39;re unschooling.&quot;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Even where enrollment isn&#39;t mandated until the age of 7, if most kids are in<br/>\n&gt; at 5 the parent is consciously doing something other than what  the<br/>\n&gt; community and government expect them to do with their child each  schoolday<br/>\n&gt; morning.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ----<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Depending on the situation, anything after age 3.5 years could be considered<br/>\n&gt; conscious unschooling, because (unfortunately0 it seems like public schools<br/>\n&gt; are pushing to have children earlier and earlier.

I&#39;m sorry when your husband said (...and I&#39;m trusting your account and hoping you weren&#39;t just pretending...) &quot;he was fine with Damon staying home with me (mom) as long as he was learning something&quot; that it didn&#39;t strike you as a little pressure to make unschooling look good!!<br/>\n<br/>\n****************************<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a four-year-old daughter, a two-year-old son, and a baby due in March.  Many of my daughterâs friends are starting preschool or kindergarten this fall.  My husband and I have already agreed not to send her to preschool.  I have the feeling that the primary reason my husband agreed to this is because preschool is not free in our school district, and we have a very tight budget.  I have a feeling the discussion will go much differently next year when we are talking about sending her to kindergarten, which *is* free.<br/>\n<br/>\nEver since I read the above exchange with Sandra, I have begun to feel this pressure to make our next year of unschooling look really great.  I know that technically we arenât unschooling because she is not actually school age, but it certainly feels that way to me since many of her friends are going to be in school.  I feel like I have to show everyone what unschooling will look like and how great it is during this next year because Iâm not sure Iâll have the chance if she goes to kindergarten.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also feeling pressure from family members.  I have been diffusing questions about what weâre going to do for kindergarten by saying things like, âwe arenât deciding anything just yet, and weâll see where we are when the time comes to decideâ but I feel like my time is running out on these kinds of responses.  My family doesnât have a positive view of home schooling in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nLately, my daughter has been talking about kindergarten and when she will get to go.  Iâm almost certain my mother-in-law and possibly sister-in-law (who is an elementary school teacher) have been talking about kindergarten with her when Iâm not around.  I donât want to prevent my daughter from going to kindergarten if thatâs what she really wants to do, but I also have a fear that she only wants to go because of the rosy picture others are painting of it for her.  Iâm pretty sure she thinks that kindergarten is where you go to play with your friends.  So I guess I also feel pressure to make unschooling/being at home really great for my daughter, so that she doesnât *want* to go away to kindergarten.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would like is suggestions and advice on how to make unschooling look impressive in our house over the next year.  I stay home with the kids full time, and I know how amazing they are and how much they are learning all the time.  I just need other people to be able to see that.  I also think I could do a better job of providing more new, interesting, stimulating things for them to do more regularly instead of falling into our usual activities.  I guess Iâm feeling a little guilty lately over how much my kids have been playing on their own or watching movies or being on the computer because I havenât been feeling well the past couple of weeks.  Iâm also worried about what will happen when the baby comes, because a newborn will take up a whole lot of my time and attention and Iâm afraid that will make it seem like my other kids arenât in an impressive unschooling environment.  Iâd like to be more proactive, and have some kind of general plan of things we can do or some vague kind of âcurriculumâ to appease well-meaning relatives, and even a well-meaning dad possibly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to avoid is being in a situation like the original poster may have, where I have a strain on my marriage and a big disagreement over unschooling and a struggle with family members and maybe even my own daughter about whether or not she should go to kindergarten.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":56751,"nextTopicId":56760}}
