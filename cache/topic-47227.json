However futuristic it may seem, what we&#39;re living through is an echo of the university&#39;s earliest history. Universitas doesn&#39;t mean campus, or class, or a particular body of knowledge; it means the guild, the group of people united in scholarship. ...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Today, we&#39;ve gone from scarcity of knowledge to unimaginable abundance. It&#39;s only natural that these new, rapidly evolving information technologies would convene new communities of scholars, both inside and outside existing institutions. The string-quartet model of education is no longer sustainable. The university of the future can&#39;t be far away.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie Ward<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47202,"nextTopicId":47224}}
