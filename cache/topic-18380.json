My boys are 7 and 4 and at first<br/>\nthere were LOTS of arguments. What I did was to re-read my Siblings<br/>\nwithout Rivalry for ideas. One that worked great for us was to let the<br/>\nboys work out a decision...not have them set up hard and fast &quot;rules&quot;<br/>\n(like time limits etc) but rather taking each disagreement individually.<br/>\nEach circumstance will be different...Jason might be really working on<br/>\ngetting to a new level and need some uninterrupted non-sharing<br/>\ntime...Kyle may not want to play against Jason any more because he is<br/>\ntired of loosing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the boys seem to be arguing and not working it out, I will go in and<br/>\nplay facilitator. I have told them that if they want me to decide, I<br/>\ncan, but that means that 1 of them will be upset and that I think they<br/>\ncan come up with something better between themselves.  Then I start<br/>\nhelping them see the others point of view and putting their feelings<br/>\ninto words (especially my 4 yo)...saying things like, well, I think that<br/>\nKyle is upset because you have been on for a long time...I think that<br/>\nJason is worried that he will never get a turn if you play now...and I<br/>\nhave been pleasantly surprised at how much this has helped them work it<br/>\nout.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing that I do if it looks like they are having a real tough<br/>\ntime and each kid is digging in, is I will offer other<br/>\nalternatives...read a Calvin and Hobbes book to Jason, offer to play<br/>\nplaymobile with Kyle, basically sweeten the pot for one or the other (or<br/>\nboth and see who bites!). They still argue at times, but it has gotten<br/>\nmuch better and I have heard them trying to reason with the other a bit<br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it really helps to realize that there is no &quot;fair&quot; way to<br/>\ndivvy it up...because the kids needs/desires to play are different at<br/>\ndifferent times...sometimes even if Jason has been playing for a really<br/>\nlong time, he will be right in the middle of section and it would not be<br/>\nfair to make him stop (kind of like if my dh said that I had to put my<br/>\nbook down at a really great part).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this same topic...anyone have any suggestions on how to help the<br/>\nyounger brother who can never beat his older brother? I have been<br/>\ntalking with Jason about keeping Kyle&#39;s feelings in mind, but he is very<br/>\ncompetitive and does not want to let his little brother to win. I try to<br/>\nplay with Kyle several times a day so that he can beat me, but I feel so<br/>\nbad for him sometimes...he gets frustrated and calls himself a loser. It<br/>\nhas gotten so Kyle goes through phases of not wanting to play anything<br/>\nwith Jason..card games, board games, they even fight over winning<br/>\ncooperative board games!<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie E.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99936689,"authorName":"mozafamily","from":"&quot;mozafamily&quot; &lt;mozafamily@...&gt;","profile":"mozafamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"No more room for more puters...","postDate":"1074829938","msgId":18380,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1cTVwaSt2ZmRhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18381,"prevInTime":18379,"nextInTime":18381,"topicId":18380,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks for your input and if I could buy a bigger house for more computers I would but right now buying another puter is not an option because there is not $","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-70626032\">Thanks for your input and if I could buy a bigger house for more <br/>\ncomputers I would but right now buying another puter is not an <br/>\noption because there is not $ or room for it.
