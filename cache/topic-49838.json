So you know going into it that the filmmaker is going to smash<br/>\n&gt; &gt; some idols.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But the kicker--the part that was truly uncomfortable to watch--was when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; interviewed the principal of the Christian school he attended as a young<br/>\n&gt; &gt; man. Knowing it&#39;s a nondenominational Christian school SHOULD give parents a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; pretty good idea of what&#39;s being taught, right? But the filmmaker starts<br/>\n&gt; &gt; asking these really pointed questions about EXACTLY what is taught from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Bible, bringing up some of the very unsavory passages; what happens to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children who don&#39;t profess to believe (are they TOLD they&#39;re going to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hell?); how does the school go about communicating to parents what they&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; teaching (he holds up a thin brochure, which seems to be the extent of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; parent education), etc. And hearing this, you think, even parents who think<br/>\n&gt; &gt; they want a &quot;Christian&quot; education for their children would never want this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; concept, or that passage, etc. taught. There was a breakdown, or a turning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; away, or a lack of trust on the part of the parents.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; But there it is. The parents could have asked the same questions that this<br/>\n&gt; &gt; filmmaker did.

I went to several conferences to further my understand the whole thing, and felt like I came out with a good understanding.  All in all, I think that there is definitely a fear of the new and a stagnation to the whole method, based on a guy who died a heck of a long time ago. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not a religion, but it does incorporate elements of multiple religions (primarily christian, but different traditions) into spirituality that I found harmless and very open to interpretation.  In fact, in &quot;3rd grade&quot; at home, we looked into the Jewish religion and found some really meaningful traditions that we played at practicing for 1/2 a year.  (At that point, I was only bringing the fun stuff from the curriculum, and my son wanted to do a lot of that stuff--even some stuff that I thought was really boring.)  Not like really practicing the religion, of course, but a fun glimpse in that impressed us all.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn several years we didn&#39;t encounter any of the extremism that Cinira talks about, and I have to wonder if some of the fearfulness expressed in the media thread might be coming through in that experience as well.

And they were pretty friendly and seemed to be independent thinkers, which I don&#39;t know if I would have seen had they been raised in as scary a place as the post below suggests.  I definitely had some of the Stepford family experience, since we ate meat AND dairy (gasp!), and I was kind of glad that the kindergarten got new carpet rather than highly concerned about &quot;off gassing.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nI think an important thing to being a successful unschooler (and a successful life liver) is the ability to take what works let go of the rest.

Rudolph Steiner the founder claimed<br/>\n&gt; he could make contact with spirits... I tell you when I first read it I<br/>\n&gt; could not believe it and thought it was all so crazy but it really seems<br/>\n&gt; that they really believe on that... and I got so mad that they do not say<br/>\n&gt; that clearly.... Rudolph Steiner recommendations were that the school<br/>\n&gt;  should not inform parents that the children are getting prepared to be<br/>\n&gt; aware of the spirits because they would not be ready for that... it would be<br/>\n&gt; too much so it should not be said...  The waldorf critics provides sources<br/>\n&gt; for everythign they say...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One person that I became friend ( another parent doing research...)  on the<br/>\n&gt; Waldorf Critics yahoo group one day sent to me an email saying... that the<br/>\n&gt; last  post on the group could not be true... he was saying this waldorf<br/>\n&gt; critcs are crazy.. I cannot believe it ...I cannot believe this is true ...<br/>\n&gt; waldorf critics were saying that Rudolph Steiner ( the founder himself) saw<br/>\n&gt; a student ( a young little girl as far as I recall) and he could feel that<br/>\n&gt; she was connected to the devil..and because of that he strongly recommended<br/>\n&gt; to inform their parents she should not go to the Waldorf school anymore....<br/>\n&gt; I was as stunned and in denial as my friend was ... i could not believe on<br/>\n&gt; that story.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then this friend said, you know what I will check the source that the<br/>\n&gt; Waldorf critics provided to this story and I am sure the story was not like<br/>\n&gt; that... he did it... he found the book and checked it.... and he told me it<br/>\n&gt; was true... it seems that really happened.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, I was in one of this foruns, I saw a post from a mother curious about<br/>\n&gt; waldorf education... positive comments started and then one person wrote<br/>\n&gt; something negative and then another one and then waldorf ppl got really<br/>\n&gt; defensive.... like you cannot say anything bad about the Waldorf<br/>\n&gt; education... then a big battle started and then ppl started to say to the<br/>\n&gt; Waldorf supporters are you going to make the forum delete these posts? and<br/>\n&gt; then all the posts were deleted!!!! The forum did remove it.... I was<br/>\n&gt; wondering why... Then I started to research more and more on the internet I<br/>\n&gt; found out that it seems to have a group of waldorf responsible to take care<br/>\n&gt; of the image of the waldorf education... and they do contact foruns and ask<br/>\n&gt; them to remove it... if they do not , they  threaten to sue the forum for<br/>\n&gt; alleging damage to the image of the Waldorf education....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra, if a waldorf supporter sees this they may do the same... LOL<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have READ stories of adults ( from Waldorf critics) that used to go to<br/>\n&gt; Waldorf School and they learnt that butterflies was a fairy reincarnated<br/>\n&gt; backwards... going to a lower level instead of developing....  as a child<br/>\n&gt; she was scared of butterflies ... and this child now as adult says that she<br/>\n&gt; has to think with logic when she sees a butterfly.. and think it is an<br/>\n&gt; insect, not a fairy and she should not be afraid...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I saw in the school small things like... a child is having a tantrum...the<br/>\n&gt; teacher recommendation was to wash the childs hand... at first I thought it<br/>\n&gt; was nothing but then I started to think more and more that the teacher<br/>\n&gt; wanted to clean the child from something...I do not know...  just weird.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other thing was explantion about not doing co sleeping... it seems that<br/>\n&gt; waldorf do not recommend co sleeping because at night is when the fairies (<br/>\n&gt; a &quot;good&quot; fairy) will visit the child and help the child to deal with this<br/>\n&gt; world, fairies will provide comfort to the child.. if the parent is sleeping<br/>\n&gt; with the child the fairies will not come. I read  that in a website....<br/>\n&gt; nobody at the school never said that but they are against co sleeping or<br/>\n&gt; breastfeeding longer than 1 year.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also there was a huge battle on the wikipedia ( english) about Waldorf<br/>\n&gt; education... check the discussion history... waldorf critics against Waldorf<br/>\n&gt; supporters... in the end Waldorf supporters won...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other thing was when I asked the teacher about Santa Claus, if I should<br/>\n&gt; introduce that to my dd or not.. You know that question, I saw posts like<br/>\n&gt; that this last Xmas... as we talked we end up talking about fairies... at<br/>\n&gt; that time I thought they thought fairies were  only to motivate<br/>\n&gt; imagination... fairies, santa for me was all the same, not real...then the<br/>\n&gt; teacher told me I had to understand that Santa is not real while fairies....<br/>\n&gt; she left that part for me to make my own conclusion....<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Then I started to see that all the paitings are watercolors... a<br/>\n&gt; homeschooler friend of mine noticed in an open house that they all draw the<br/>\n&gt; same thing... if it is a flower, it is all the same. exactly the same...<br/>\n&gt; where is creativity? where is freedom?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The other crazy stuff that I read and then I posted in the portuguese<br/>\n&gt; version of wikipedia was that Waldorf education believes parents should tell<br/>\n&gt; the teacher all things that are happening on the child life so they can<br/>\n&gt; understand them better... like someone passed away in the family, the child<br/>\n&gt; will be playing about that... pretending and etc... I listened to that<br/>\n&gt; example  in a Waldorf Conference...  the person was saying that this kind of<br/>\n&gt; play was helping the child deal with the matter... free play allow children<br/>\n&gt; that... ok, I could see that.... but then came the creepy part... I read<br/>\n&gt; this article ( this was in portuguese, not from the Waldorf Critics) from a<br/>\n&gt;  person that believes in spirits and reincarnation and etc.... that the<br/>\n&gt; waldorf education was wonderful because the teacher could assess the child<br/>\n&gt; past lives and understand why they were behaving in some ways ... the<br/>\n&gt; teacher could understand that the child was digesting issues in past lifes<br/>\n&gt; on this life and that  would help the child to develop even more as a<br/>\n&gt; spirit... the portuguse article said that was why it was so important for<br/>\n&gt; the child to have a teacher that would be the teacher for several years...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Please do not get me wrong... I still think it is all crazy... I really<br/>\n&gt; recommend ppl to do their own research and find out...  I really will<br/>\n&gt; understand if ppl think it is not true, I was the same way... but now I can<br/>\n&gt; see.. it is a religion... nothing against religion... I just think it should<br/>\n&gt; be clear it is a religion... then ppl will join or not...  but using<br/>\n&gt; education like that... it is manipulation...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have to say one thing though... I have a friend that her partner works<br/>\n&gt; there... and they do have to pay for their children education.. it is not<br/>\n&gt; free for them...<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Well... that is it!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; C.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; On Sat, Jan 23, 2010 at 4:59 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; -=-I took my now 7 year old to a Waldorf parent/child class when he<br/>\n&gt; &gt; was 2 & 3.

They aren&#39;t big tv watchers but the<br/>\n&gt; dad is a musician.  As in he records records.  And his music is on cds.<br/>\n&gt; They said that the students at that particular school weren&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to<br/>\n&gt; have cds and couldn&#39;t listen to recorded music and that having such<br/>\n&gt; electronic devices would automatically disqualify them.  (Of course this is<br/>\n&gt; second hand information) but doesn&#39;t this sound more like a cult than a<br/>\n&gt; school?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I recently took my kids to a new &quot;homeschool co op&quot; at a good friend&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; house.  It was started and run by some &quot;Waldorfians&quot;.  I SWEAR I felt like I<br/>\n&gt; was in an inquisition.  Almost immediately I&#39;m being asked about the way we<br/>\n&gt; learn to read and whether or not we watch tv (to which I responded &quot;We watch<br/>\n&gt; a LOT of tv and we LOVE it!!!&quot;)  Later in the afternoon I notice that the<br/>\n&gt; moms are all being called &quot;Mama (insert first name&quot;) and now when we are<br/>\n&gt; with the friend who hosted I am being called &quot;Mama Mandy&quot; and it bugs me a<br/>\n&gt; little... kinda creepy.  That day the &quot;leader&quot; lady also made everyone get<br/>\n&gt; into a peace circle and do something that reminded me of chanting and then a<br/>\n&gt; group hug just bc my son had been upset (I was not involved with deciding if<br/>\n&gt; his being upset needed such a huge production and it really embarassed<br/>\n&gt; him).  We high tailed it out of there.  I felt GROSS for days and I told my<br/>\n&gt; friend how much it was not a good fit for me.   Needless to say I&#39;ve not<br/>\n&gt; been invited back.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The whole thing is just a little too Stepfordish for my taste.

My daughter was in Ramona&#39;s class.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my own behalf and on behalf of my responsibilities for the school, I apologize to her for the really poor way the teachers in general and she in particular were trained and supported.  Or I should say not trained and not supported.  The only meager defense I can offer is that the curriculum was intended to use, was never written as it had been promised us by the developer.  By default we had to find an alternate curriculum source or demand that our teachers make it all up on the spot.  Neither was a good option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had and continue to have nothing but respect for what Ramona tried to achieve in her classroom under extremely trying circumstances--the lack of teacher training, faculty support, materials was astounding--yet she worked valiantly to engage every single student in that class.  My daughter still has the dolly that they each made on first day of class.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a weasley lame-ass thing that the school put over on teachers, parents, and students alike.  It was our own lack of appropriate preparation as a school board that led directly to the situation where no good options existed. I resigned my seat on the board, refused an offer to become faculty, and pulled my kids also just before Halloween that year.  I don&#39;t regret my work for the school, but I heartily regret that for all our energy, we didn&#39;t create a workable school that even resembled the ideals we each held.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you pointed out, though, the essence of this situation had only peripherally to do with Waldorf.  The deficiencies in planning, preparation, and support and the political infighting that created those deficiencies could have happened regardless of pedagogy.  Still, please pass my apologies to Ramona for not working harder to hear and support her concerns when she brought them to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Kee</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Waldorf in general","postDate":"1264350080","msgId":49946,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ5QUMxMTgzLUMxRjAtNEY5Qy1BMzlDLThGMENCRTY4MEJFQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMTAwMTI0MDYwOWc1NThhYzc2NHI2ODM5ODVmMWNjYzkzZjFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMTAwMTIzMTcxM2k2NWMzNmQwMHQ3ZjNmODBiYjhlOTViNWVhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8aGpna29yK2VucnRAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+IDwxYmUwNDdmMDEwMDEyNDA2MDlnNTU4YWM3NjRyNjgzOTg1ZjFjY2M5M2YxZEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":49944,"nextInTopic":49951,"prevInTime":49945,"nextInTime":49947,"topicId":49838,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m enjoying reading those.

It&#39;s fascinating like a trainwreck  <br/>\ncrawling with gnomes and festooned with cancer-curing mistletoe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, about the absence of direct seeing, seemed worth quoting:<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\nThe effects of Waldorf�s educational program gradually accumulated in  <br/>\nour heads and hearts. After I had been at the school only a few years,  <br/>\nthe notion of trying to see the world clearly had lost almost all  <br/>\nmeaning for me. Everything seemed symbolic rather than concrete,  <br/>\nalthough what the symbols stood for was vague. Everything had its  <br/>\nhidden deeps. It�s hard to remember now precisely how I was led to  <br/>\nadopt this attitude. But a booklet written by our headmaster, John  <br/>\nFentress Gardner, throws light on the world view that Waldorf  <br/>\nencouraged. In the booklet, Mr. Gardner discusses �the art of  <br/>\neducation developed in Waldorf Schools.� The booklet included such  <br/>\nstatements as:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs not the contrast between mountain and sea a cause as well as an  <br/>\nimage of deep contrasts in the moral experience of mankind? Mountains  <br/>\ndefine, but by the same act they also divide. They teach integrity,  <br/>\nbut may go further to instill antipathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe language was more elevated than any that our teachers used with  <br/>\nus, but the message paralleled what we were taught: Nothing is simply  <br/>\nwhat it is, it is always something more. A mountain isn�t just a mass  <br/>\nof granite, it is a lesson, an image bearing on our moral experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only were people discouraged from seeing the world clearly, but  <br/>\nanyone who thinks he IS seeing clearly will be told he&#39;s mistaken,  <br/>\nthat the meanings are obscured and require special guides to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think unschooling is ideal for people who do want to just look right  <br/>\nat people and places and things and make connections of their own, in  <br/>\ntheir own ways.  People who are attached to the idea of hidden  <br/>\nmeanings and conspiracies and magic might have a harder time directly  <br/>\nseeing unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337025893,"authorName":"Cinira Longuinho","from":"Cinira Longuinho &lt;ciniravlonguinho@...&gt;","profile":"ciniravlonguinho","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:Waldorf in general","postDate":"1264342148","msgId":49944,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMTAwMTI0MDYwOWc1NThhYzc2NHI2ODM5ODVmMWNjYzkzZjFkQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhqZ2tvcitlbnJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFiZTA0N2YwMTAwMTIzMTcxM2k2NWMzNmQwMHQ3ZjNmODBiYjhlOTViNWVhQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPGhqZ2tvcitlbnJ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49943,"nextInTopic":49946,"prevInTime":49943,"nextInTime":49945,"topicId":49838,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, ====I m not saying that the way the Waldorf school or schools set it up isn t manipulation, I just think that anyone can and should do research and ask","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1543922155\">Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\n====I&#39;m not saying that the way the Waldorf school or schools set it up<br/>\nisn&#39;t manipulation, I just think that anyone can and should do research and<br/>\nask questions.

I saw motivation to be<br/>\nmore in contact with nature, I could see older children doing lots of<br/>\npaitings, music and etc... it was wonderful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut slowly I started to see something weird here and there.... small<br/>\ndetails. Plus, I was already in contact with homeschoolers... and they told<br/>\nme that it was a cult. I got defensive but slowly I could see that more and<br/>\nmore...<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I decided to do a research online and I found a group called Waldorf<br/>\nCritics (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waldorfcritics.org/active/articles.html)\">http://www.waldorfcritics.org/active/articles.html)</a> in the USA that<br/>\nreally opened my eyes plus several articles.... plus a forum episode...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the Waldorf education is based on spiritism...It is a<br/>\nreligious school based on spiritism... Rudolph Steiner the founder claimed<br/>\nhe could make contact with spirits... I tell you when I first read it I<br/>\ncould not believe it and thought it was all so crazy but it really seems<br/>\nthat they really believe on that... and I got so mad that they do not say<br/>\nthat clearly.... Rudolph Steiner recommendations were that the school<br/>\n should not inform parents that the children are getting prepared to be<br/>\naware of the spirits because they would not be ready for that... it would be<br/>\ntoo much so it should not be said...  The waldorf critics provides sources<br/>\nfor everythign they say...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne person that I became friend ( another parent doing research...)  on the<br/>\nWaldorf Critics yahoo group one day sent to me an email saying... that the<br/>\nlast  post on the group could not be true... he was saying this waldorf<br/>\ncritcs are crazy.. I cannot believe it ...I cannot believe this is true ...<br/>\nwaldorf critics were saying that Rudolph Steiner ( the founder himself) saw<br/>\na student ( a young little girl as far as I recall) and he could feel that<br/>\nshe was connected to the devil..and because of that he strongly recommended<br/>\nto inform their parents she should not go to the Waldorf school anymore....<br/>\nI was as stunned and in denial as my friend was ... i could not believe on<br/>\nthat story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen this friend said, you know what I will check the source that the<br/>\nWaldorf critics provided to this story and I am sure the story was not like<br/>\nthat... he did it... he found the book and checked it.... and he told me it<br/>\nwas true... it seems that really happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I was in one of this foruns, I saw a post from a mother curious about<br/>\nwaldorf education... positive comments started and then one person wrote<br/>\nsomething negative and then another one and then waldorf ppl got really<br/>\ndefensive.... like you cannot say anything bad about the Waldorf<br/>\neducation... then a big battle started and then ppl started to say to the<br/>\nWaldorf supporters are you going to make the forum delete these posts? and<br/>\nthen all the posts were deleted!!!! The forum did remove it.... I was<br/>\nwondering why... Then I started to research more and more on the internet I<br/>\nfound out that it seems to have a group of waldorf responsible to take care<br/>\nof the image of the waldorf education... and they do contact foruns and ask<br/>\nthem to remove it... if they do not , they  threaten to sue the forum for<br/>\nalleging damage to the image of the Waldorf education....<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra, if a waldorf supporter sees this they may do the same... LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI have READ stories of adults ( from Waldorf critics) that used to go to<br/>\nWaldorf School and they learnt that butterflies was a fairy reincarnated<br/>\nbackwards... going to a lower level instead of developing....  as a child<br/>\nshe was scared of butterflies ... and this child now as adult says that she<br/>\nhas to think with logic when she sees a butterfly.. and think it is an<br/>\ninsect, not a fairy and she should not be afraid...<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw in the school small things like... a child is having a tantrum...the<br/>\nteacher recommendation was to wash the childs hand... at first I thought it<br/>\nwas nothing but then I started to think more and more that the teacher<br/>\nwanted to clean the child from something...I do not know...  just weird.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing was explantion about not doing co sleeping... it seems that<br/>\nwaldorf do not recommend co sleeping because at night is when the fairies (<br/>\na &quot;good&quot; fairy) will visit the child and help the child to deal with this<br/>\nworld, fairies will provide comfort to the child.. if the parent is sleeping<br/>\nwith the child the fairies will not come. I read  that in a website....<br/>\nnobody at the school never said that but they are against co sleeping or<br/>\nbreastfeeding longer than 1 year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there was a huge battle on the wikipedia ( english) about Waldorf<br/>\neducation... check the discussion history... waldorf critics against Waldorf<br/>\nsupporters... in the end Waldorf supporters won...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing was when I asked the teacher about Santa Claus, if I should<br/>\nintroduce that to my dd or not.. You know that question, I saw posts like<br/>\nthat this last Xmas... as we talked we end up talking about fairies... at<br/>\nthat time I thought they thought fairies were  only to motivate<br/>\nimagination... fairies, santa for me was all the same, not real...then the<br/>\nteacher told me I had to understand that Santa is not real while fairies....<br/>\nshe left that part for me to make my own conclusion....<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started to see that all the paitings are watercolors... a<br/>\nhomeschooler friend of mine noticed in an open house that they all draw the<br/>\nsame thing... if it is a flower, it is all the same. exactly the same...<br/>\nwhere is creativity? where is freedom?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other crazy stuff that I read and then I posted in the portuguese<br/>\nversion of wikipedia was that Waldorf education believes parents should tell<br/>\nthe teacher all things that are happening on the child life so they can<br/>\nunderstand them better... like someone passed away in the family, the child<br/>\nwill be playing about that... pretending and etc... I listened to that<br/>\nexample  in a Waldorf Conference...  the person was saying that this kind of<br/>\nplay was helping the child deal with the matter... free play allow children<br/>\nthat... ok, I could see that.... but then came the creepy part... I read<br/>\nthis article ( this was in portuguese, not from the Waldorf Critics) from a<br/>\n person that believes in spirits and reincarnation and etc.... that the<br/>\nwaldorf education was wonderful because the teacher could assess the child<br/>\npast lives and understand why they were behaving in some ways ... the<br/>\nteacher could understand that the child was digesting issues in past lifes<br/>\non this life and that  would help the child to develop even more as a<br/>\nspirit... the portuguse article said that was why it was so important for<br/>\nthe child to have a teacher that would be the teacher for several years...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease do not get me wrong... I still think it is all crazy... I really<br/>\nrecommend ppl to do their own research and find out...  I really will<br/>\nunderstand if ppl think it is not true, I was the same way... but now I can<br/>\nsee.. it is a religion... nothing against religion... I just think it should<br/>\nbe clear it is a religion... then ppl will join or not...  but using<br/>\neducation like that... it is manipulation...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say one thing though... I have a friend that her partner works<br/>\nthere... and they do have to pay for their children education.. it is not<br/>\nfree for them...<br/>\n<br/>\nWell... that is it!<br/>\n<br/>\nC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Sat, Jan 23, 2010 at 4:59 PM, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-I took my now 7 year old to a Waldorf parent/child class when he<br/>\n&gt; was 2 & 3.

What the so called &quot;experts&quot; say concerning television and the way children behave is not at all the same as what I see in my own children and those we&#39;re around who also have unlimited access.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy children will turn any toy into whatever they want it to be.  Sometimes they incorporate t.v./movie/computer characters into their play and sometimes they don&#39;t.  Just the other day my two boys (ages 7 & 4 who can watch t.v. or hop on the computer whenever they want) played for 6 hours straight solely with each other and the various toys in our house.  They went from building with legos to playing pirates to using their  &quot;magic wands&quot; to defeat the bad wizards to getting out our play tent and playing various imaginative games with it.  After 6 hours they did hop on the computer and took turns (working it out amongst themselves) playing various games .  I brought them their dinner while they were playing on the computer and they each came back into the kitchen separately to get more food for the other one:)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI took my now 7 year old to a Waldorf parent/child class when he was 2 & 3.  We both really enjoyed it, but when they tried to solicit us to sign up for the new school they were starting here, it just didn&#39;t feel right.  I thank my lucky stars that I came across unschooling at about this same time and embraced it (not fully in the beginning, still clinging a little to the waldorf ideas), but gradually and now after almost 4 years I have to say we are full fledged unschoolers and I love our life!  I am grateful for this list and for all the seasoned unschoolers who take the time to post about their unschooling experiences with their own children.  My children are free and their happy, what more could you ask for?  My advice would be to trust & listen to your children over any expert.  We are living with our children everyday and know them better than anyone else ever could. <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie v.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/\">http://lerendzonderschool.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Hema A.

It was lovely.  I liked<br/>\nthe people.  Blah blah blah.  But I got the sense that if I had dared to<br/>\nmention that my kids watch &quot;Spongebob&quot; or that they say &quot;fart face&quot;<br/>\noccasionally, I&#39;d be shunned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMove forward a year and I have some friends in Atlanta who applied to have<br/>\ntheir son enrolled at a Waldorf school.  They aren&#39;t big tv watchers but the<br/>\ndad is a musician.  As in he records records.  And his music is on cds.<br/>\nThey said that the students at that particular school weren&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to<br/>\nhave cds and couldn&#39;t listen to recorded music and that having such<br/>\nelectronic devices would automatically disqualify them.  (Of course this is<br/>\nsecond hand information) but doesn&#39;t this sound more like a cult than a<br/>\nschool?<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently took my kids to a new &quot;homeschool co op&quot; at a good friend&#39;s<br/>\nhouse.  It was started and run by some &quot;Waldorfians&quot;.  I SWEAR I felt like I<br/>\nwas in an inquisition.  Almost immediately I&#39;m being asked about the way we<br/>\nlearn to read and whether or not we watch tv (to which I responded &quot;We watch<br/>\na LOT of tv and we LOVE it!!!&quot;)  Later in the afternoon I notice that the<br/>\nmoms are all being called &quot;Mama (insert first name&quot;) and now when we are<br/>\nwith the friend who hosted I am being called &quot;Mama Mandy&quot; and it bugs me a<br/>\nlittle... kinda creepy.  That day the &quot;leader&quot; lady also made everyone get<br/>\ninto a peace circle and do something that reminded me of chanting and then a<br/>\ngroup hug just bc my son had been upset (I was not involved with deciding if<br/>\nhis being upset needed such a huge production and it really embarassed<br/>\nhim).  We high tailed it out of there.  I felt GROSS for days and I told my<br/>\nfriend how much it was not a good fit for me.   Needless to say I&#39;ve not<br/>\nbeen invited back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole thing is just a little too Stepfordish for my taste.  I need to go<br/>\ntake a shower.  ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mandy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Waldorf in general","postDate":"1264098452","msgId":49838,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4QzAwOUQyLTlCQzMtNEE2MC1BMUQ4LUU5RTg5MjFDMjc5RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":49840,"prevInTime":49837,"nextInTime":49839,"topicId":49838,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"So what is the difference between Waldorf and Steiner?

One came from  <br/>\nthe other, but did other things also come from it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI asked Holly what she thought about Waldorf schools, or if she knew  <br/>\nwhat Waldorf was.  She asked, &quot;Is that the one with the fairies?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYes.  And the recorders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to her about dolls without faces, and whether she thought a  <br/>\ndoll with a face limited imaginative play.  She said not at all, that  <br/>\nthe kids imagine the face to be other ways, and it&#39;s just the adults  <br/>\nwho think that&#39;s not possible.  &quot;It seems obvious to me that whoever  <br/>\nwanted dolls not to have faces didn&#39;t have an imagination anymore.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Holly is right about these things.  Pretty often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to buy things from the Hearthsong catalog, which was  <br/>\nexclusively Waldorfy in the 1980&#39;s, and it was great stuff, but my  <br/>\nkids played with colored bees wax and scarves and fairy wands while  <br/>\nwatching Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers and Ninja Turtles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50201,"nextTopicId":50192}}
