Abstract skills *can&#39;t* be learned by a child who is too young to learn them - and while there&#39;s some variability, for sure, it&#39;s not a stretch to say your average 3yo doesn&#39;t do a lot of abstract thinking while your average 13yo does a great deal of it. Saying a child &quot;should&quot; learn this or that in a particular order is ignoring the data in favor of a pet theory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;... *after* close immersion in the natural world. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Any time someone writes that &quot;the natural world&quot; is &quot;better&quot; for kids I question their sample populations.

There&#39;s a segment of the population who intuitively catch on to letter-sound correspondences and figure out the basics of reading somewhere around age 4 - right in the middle of the preoperational stage. The catch is, it *is* an intuitve grasp so despite all those parents and educators who would love to capitalize on it, there&#39;s no way to teach that understanding. Once kids get into the concrete operational stage... around 7ish, most are ready to learn to read by some logical sequence of aquiring information, which is why teaching reading to 7 and 8yos seems to work so well. Their brains are already starting to process the right kind of data. The same fact, though, means that given a print-rich environment, they&#39;ll learn to read without being taught. Most of them. Then there&#39;s another small set who don&#39;t learn to read until the formal operational stage at puberty. It&#39;s all about brain development, though - there are broad patterns, for sure, but specific skills may develop at a wide range of times and reading is a good example - kids are naturally ready to read anywhere over a whole decade of growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Pearce says you should actively<br/>\n&gt; discourage reading before age 7 <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As a message to school and homeschool parents, its better advice than pushing early reading! But it&#39;s really advice about when to teach. That&#39;s part of the problem with the study of psychology and development as pertains to children - as more and more kids are put in school or otherwise &quot;educated&quot; earlier and earlier all the theories are growing to revolve around how to best teach or best help kids fit in to schools. If you want information about how kids learn without being taught, read radical unschooling lists, sites and forums. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] article about how learning to read early is bad for developing minds","postDate":"1313247504","msgId":62344,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVBQTI1MUNGLTgwNTEtNDQ3Mi1CQkQzLTcxNzBDQTgzRTc4QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMTMyMjk4OTguMjg2NC4xNDAyNTgxMjkxOTEzODFAd2VibWFpbC5tZXNzYWdpbmdlbmdpbmUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGoyNTZ2ZCtjYmY1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTMxMzIyOTg5OC4yODY0LjE0MDI1ODEyOTE5MTM4MUB3ZWJtYWlsLm1lc3NhZ2luZ2VuZ2luZS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62339,"nextInTopic":62345,"prevInTime":62343,"nextInTime":62345,"topicId":62334,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-My son could not be prevented from reading - perhaps an overstatement, but we would have had to hide all the books in the house.

Unfortunately, as you point out, others tend to think the parents DID something to create that ability, or &quot;taught&quot; the child to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think parents should provide for children&#39;s interests and abilities in natural, casual, cheerful ways no matter what the child&#39;s talents or abilities are, and some will be kicking a football around at three, or riding a bicycle, or playing piano, or reading, or doing fancy math tricks in their heads or drawing recognizable birds or singing up a storm.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-There is an old quote something like &quot;when the bird book and<br/>\nthe bird disagree, believe the bird.&quot; i&#39;m pretty sure my son would<br/>\nbelieve the book.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of people believe what&#39;s in books before they believe their own observations and thoughts.  Rather than worry about it, maybe just ask him gently, if it really matters, where he thinks books come from. Or perhaps casually find an older book with information that was once &quot;fact&quot; but that changed, and introduce the idea of the age of a book, or the reliability of the author.<br/>\n<br/>\nTanganyika, or a platypus, or the way a computer works--those things are not the same now as they were twenty, forty years ago.

A child who reads at three might not become a much better reader for ten years.  A child who reads at ten might be a better reader that year than a friend who started at three.
