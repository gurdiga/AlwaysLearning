It&#39;s a common problem among semi-literate adults - they went through school with phonics training at every turn and are convinced that&#39;s the way to learn to read. Once they&#39;re assured that the Worst thing they can do is sound things out, that they were taught wrong, they learn to read pretty quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on the teacher at this point - the approach she&#39;s using is a kind of &quot;whole language&quot; method, and those &quot;work&quot; by being accessible to a variety of learning styles. As long as she&#39;s skillful and adaptable rather than systematic, she&#39;s well set up to provide him with a framework which will be helpful once he&#39;s actually ready to read. The method she&#39;s using is said to be very systematic, though, so if she won&#39;t allow him to &quot;advance&quot; until he&#39;s master earlier stages, it could undermine his ability to read. That&#39;s the worst thing about reading education - it can actually keep people from learning to read, if it&#39;s done badly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf having a tutor helps this guy build some confidence, that&#39;s a good thing.

And if he feels that he wants some kind of<br/>\ninstruction or program, I wouldn&#39;t act like it is necessary at all, but I&#39;d<br/>\nlet him give it a try if I could find something that seemed appropriate for<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a big word of warning --- he&#39;s clearly NOT a person who is naturally<br/>\nlearning in an auditory way - he&#39;s not picking up the sounds of letters<br/>\nfrom seeing them all over and hearing people read them, etc., and that&#39;s a<br/>\nkey indication that he is probably not much of an auditory learner. He&#39;s<br/>\nprobably a very visual/spatial and/or kinesthetic learner. So when I say<br/>\n&quot;help him learn to read&quot; I do NOT mean start him on some kind of phonics<br/>\nprogram. That is NOT the only way - even though it seems to be the only way<br/>\nreading specialists and school teachers recognize these days.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo some research on visual/spatial and kinesthetic learners and see if you<br/>\ncan figure out ways to help him begin to recognize words.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy youngest daughter who is a very athletic and active person (still is at<br/>\n21) didn&#39;t naturally learn phonics and didn&#39;t know all the letter sounds<br/>\nwhen she began reading at 8 - but she began reading by being able to<br/>\nrecognize words, not sound them out. I used to write words on a card -<br/>\naction words like &quot;jump&quot; and &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;bend&quot; -- I&#39;d hold them up and she&#39;d<br/>\ndo them. If she didn&#39;t recognize the word then I would do it and she&#39;d join<br/>\nme. I started with two words - &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;Stop.&quot; Then slowly added words<br/>\nto the little stack of cards - slipping in a new one every so often. I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t slip in any until she knew the existing ones well. This was<br/>\nsomething we did for maybe 5 minutes or less every once in a while - not as<br/>\na program but just for fun. But my point is that there are other ways to<br/>\nlearn to read than by learning letter sounds - and another approach like<br/>\nthat might help your son.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo some research on how visual/spatial and kinesthetic kids learn to read.<br/>\nMaybe there is a computer program out there that he might enjoy and would<br/>\ntake more of a sight reading approach or at least a combined phonics/sight<br/>\nreading approach. Also you might look at the &quot;adult literacy&quot; sites for<br/>\nideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut don&#39;t get freaked out because some reading specialist type was so<br/>\nnegative - remember that she&#39;s looking at school kids and if a 12 yo school<br/>\nkid is not reading that is a pretty big disaster for that kid and a major<br/>\nfailure for the school. For an unschooler, it isn&#39;t that big a deal. So<br/>\nhelp him learn, yes, but don&#39;t act like there is something wrong with him -<br/>\npay way more attention to what he does well than what he doesn&#39;t yet do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam sorooshian<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173560398,"authorName":"sebrina w","from":"&quot;sebrina w&quot; &lt;sunmamma@...&gt;","profile":"sebrinawilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Help.....

People do believe these things, though, and it&#39;s just not so.<br/>\nWith dyslexia you HAVE to be trained in how to get past it. this isnt just some person that could read at some point. if he isnt trained HOW to see letters in groups that form words he never will be able to do it and it will ALWAYS be frustrating for him. since neither of you are very aware of dyslexia I am going to tell you that some of the unschooling pracitces just do not apply to dyslexics. the whole concept of not insisting they do things doesnt work. people with dyslexia are forced to do these types of eye and mind training so that at some point things suddenly get easier for them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>FRom this page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/myths%c2%a0\">http://sandradodd.com/myths%c2%a0</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote> <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: sebrina w &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:sunmamma@...\">sunmamma@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2012 3:43 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Help..... Sinking and scared because of silly assessment<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nI recently wrote to the group about my 12 year old son possibly having dyslexia and teaching him to read. He really wants to learn and because I have dyslexia myself I didn&#39;t know where to start so I contacted a local tutor who specializes in dyslexia assessment and tutoring. I felt as though I had found the right person to help when she told she homeschooled her 4 children. Anyways we took Ryan for an assessment (which by the way he really wanted to do) and she scared the crap out of me. She said he was at a preschool to kindergarten level so it was hard to diagnose dyslexia. He knows most of his letters (always forgets H) but doesn&#39;t really know all the sounds they make, he knows some whole words mostly learned from video games. She asked him things like months of the year in order which he didn&#39;t know... At the end of the assessment she told me I should take him to the sick kids hospital because she was worried he was brain damaged. I left the office<br/>\n in tears. But my son wants to go forward with tutoring with her and he really likes her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my question is do you think there IS something wrong with my son. Is it so bad that he can&#39;t print (he hates to hold a pencil) and he doesn&#39;t know all the sounds the letters make at 12? She said it would be harder to teach him since he&#39;s so old but that goes against what I believe which is its easier when they are ready even if they are older. I don&#39;t know if I should continue with the tutoring.
