Augustine, like Cicero before him, would have  had to practice a <br/>\ntext before reading it out loud, since sight-reading was in  his day an <br/>\nunusual skill and often led to errors of interpretation. The fourth-  century <br/>\ngrammarian Servius criticized his colleague Donat for reading, in  Virgil&#39;s Aeneid, <br/>\nthe words collectam ex llio pubem (&quot;a people gathered from  troy&quot;) instead of <br/>\ncollectam exilio pubem (&quot;a people gathered for exile&quot;). Such  mistakes were <br/>\ncommon when reading a continuous text.-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nBecause of punctuation, modern English is pretty easy to read  aloud without <br/>\na whole lot of preparation.  It wouldn&#39;t be cool to read cold  for radio or <br/>\nrecordings, but it can happen that people can read a whole lot of  cold text <br/>\nwithout making a mistake, thanks to commas, quotation marks and  periods.<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a different skill, though, than &quot;reading for meaning,&quot;  silently to <br/>\noneself.  <br/>\n <br/>\nStill looking for clues...<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":22264,"nextTopicId":22272}}
