I am horrified at what occasionally slips out of people on<br/>\naccident now that they KNOW my kids are mixed.  My brother in law, who I<br/>\nhate in general not because of this, acts like he just loves my kids, has<br/>\nthem crawling all over him, etc..  Then made some comment awhile back about<br/>\nhow &quot;beaners&quot; should stay south.  It broke my heart to think of my kids, who<br/>\nare under the impression that he loves them, hearing that crap.  Luckily we<br/>\nsee him less than once a year.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would much rather deal with the people with shaved heads and KKK bumper<br/>\nstickers than to deal with hidden racism.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone seen &quot;Dragon&quot; about Bruce Lee?  It deals, very well I think, with<br/>\nLinda Lee (who is Anglo) coming to see racism through her husband&#39;s eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":6670,"nextTopicId":6582}}
