She specifically asked to go to the local shop (A Knot of Yarn, that sadly closed down not too long ago) to find out if someone could show her.  We went together, she walked in, and asked questions.  I didn&#39;t need to say anything.  The owner was wonderful.  My dd decided to sign up for a group class.  She spent her time with adults, knitting, talking, and having a great time.  And then she didn&#39;t want to go anymore.  We had paid a fee for the instruction but she was done.  I didn&#39;t make her complete the time paid just because we spent the money.  So no, I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with &quot;lessons&quot; (though I&#39;m not sure that word is always applicable) if the child wants to do it and is never forced to continue for arbitrary reasons.  In our case, we didn&#39;t know anyone personally who could knit, but we had driven by that shop lots of times.  It was the first place dd thought about.  In fact, I wonder if she wanted to learn because we drove past it so much.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is taking music lessons now, playing 2 instruments and loves every moment of it.  She is also in a beginning orchestra.  She is really good and her instructor thinks she has a natural talent.  However, my dd11 knows she can quit or make changes.

I had a horse as a child but there are so many things that I never learned from just riding on my own - bareback and a bridle only. We started the riding lessons a couple of years ago - I decided I was going to take lessons and Zac (age 15) wanted to too.  Ed (hubby) took for a year with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nZac just started Japanese sword fighting lessons 2 weeks ago.  His choice totally - he requested it after we attended the local Japan Festival.  It might last another week or it might last several years.  It is a pay by the month deal with no lengthy contracts like some martial arts places.  He could have probably found stuff on-line to watch to help him acquire these skills but he wanted to be more precise in his skill, therefore he wants to take lessons from a master.  The Japan Festival came about because I hear about things to do and mention them to Zac to see if he is interested.  Knowing how is he all about anything Japanese I saw this festival and showed him the web site and asked if he wanted to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith carving he went through a 2 year stage where he carved constantly,  Mostly replica weapons and mostly replica swords of various types.  I offered to help find a master carver for him to work with (there are guilds locally and several offered to let him join) and he said no he was not interested in that.  We basically had the resources though, a good knife and a grinder.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s taken lessons of various types over the years, some he&#39;s stuck with for several years and some only a few lessons.  For instance he took a volleyball class - said the constant drill, drill, drill  took all the fun out of playing - he just wanted to play casually so he quit.  He played basketball for one season and really enjoyed the casual, divide everyone up and let&#39;s play, way of doing it.  Fencing he took for a year then ceased.   HapKiDo he did for 4 or more years. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it does all depend on our options.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa W.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] lessons, knitting, unschooling (was Learning Spanish with dvd or else ?","postDate":"1254073729","msgId":47643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwODA5Ni43MjM4OS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDk4MDM4OTY2LUM3NEEtNENGMS04OURBLTBBMTlBNzNEODczM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGg5bzM2Mit2b25jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8OTgwMzg5NjYtQzc0QS00Q0YxLTg5REEtMEExOUE3M0Q4NzMzQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47642,"nextInTopic":47646,"prevInTime":47642,"nextInTime":47644,"topicId":47587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"________________________________ From: Sandra Dodd  To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com Sent: Sunday, 27 September, 2009 6:36:41 PM ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2067134383\">________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Sunday, 27 September, 2009 6:36:41 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] lessons, knitting, unschooling (was Learning Spanish with dvd or else ?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I do have one question.

I learned to knit from books that I checked out at the library. My mom showed me how when I was a kid and I can remember sitting outside on a lawn chair trying to purl or knit and failing and getting distracted and it came to naught. Years later, pregnant with my second child, getting ready to go to spend Christmas with my grandparents and my mom and step-dad I got some books from the library and figured out how to knit. Linnaea&#39;s first passport photo has her in the first sweater I ever knitted. After years of not quite getting it right I spent some time in the past year watching videos on-line and asking people who love to knit about what I was doing wrong and I&#39;ve now made 2 pairs of socks. One pair from the top down one from the bottom up. For me the learning happened because I wanted the skill. If your child wants to learn to make something particular, go to youtube and see what<br/>\n you can find on knitting that thing. If you know someone who knits, or you join up with a group of people where there is also knitting going on talk to the knitting folks and they&#39;ll give pointers. Basic knitting is fairly easy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"lessons, knitting, unschooling (was Learning Spanish with dvd or else ?","postDate":"1254073001","msgId":47642,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk4MDM4OTY2LUM3NEEtNENGMS04OURBLTBBMTlBNzNEODczM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5bzM2Mit2b25jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5bzM2Mit2b25jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47640,"nextInTopic":47643,"prevInTime":47641,"nextInTime":47643,"topicId":47587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I do have one question.

I was that way myself with calligraphy, recorder and  <br/>\nguitar.  I had messed with all of them, but when I went to get  <br/>\nlessons, what I needed was how far to dip the pen in the ink, and what  <br/>\nangles to hold it, because there&#39;s an angle to the paper, and the the  <br/>\nangle of the wide nib in relation to the writer&#39;s hand.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nunderstand those from written directions (if they were there; they  <br/>\nweren&#39;t, exactly, I discovered later).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first recorder lesson I got showed me how different the  <br/>\n&quot;embouchure&quot; (how to hold one&#39;s mouth inside, and on the mouthpiece)  <br/>\nwas from other wind instruments.  Very light and soft.  And I needed  <br/>\nto see how to hold the instrument when most holes were open.  How&#39;s  <br/>\nthe recorder not to just fall on the floor?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith guitar, I expected to take lots of lessons, but one lesson with  <br/>\nhow to read chord charts and how to fingerpick sent me on an excited  <br/>\nlook through all the music and folksong books I already had with  <br/>\nguitar chords *right there* though I&#39;d never thought of what all those  <br/>\nsuperscript D G and A things were about.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith knitting, it might need some explanations and good, modern  <br/>\nsupplies and samples of what happens if needles or yarn aren&#39;t the  <br/>\nrecommended size.  I have a baby hat that fits me, that a friend  <br/>\nmade.   She explained why, and I still wear the hat that was supposed  <br/>\nto have fit Kirby.  (It would fit him now, actually; maybe I should  <br/>\nsend her another thank-you-note.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIs knitting something you the parent might want to learn too?  Maybe  <br/>\nyou could both go to a class and then help each other later.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she does start to knit, maybe keep an eye out for interesting  <br/>\narticles or pieces or blog posts or patterns.  Even if it&#39;s way beyond  <br/>\nher ability to do, she might like to know the range of what&#39;s  <br/>\npossible, and how far back people knitted, what knitting&#39;s relatives  <br/>\nare, or she might not care.  It could connect to lots of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the parents&#39; first thought is &quot;lessons&quot; and they expect to simply  <br/>\npay another person to insure that their children will learn all of a  <br/>\nthing, then the parents are probably not far enough into becoming  <br/>\nunschoolers yet, and could use some more time finding connections and  <br/>\nnatural learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/stages\">http://sandradodd.com/stages</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":413697532,"authorName":"thetiemensfamily","from":"&quot;thetiemensfamily&quot; &lt;thetiemensfamily@...&gt;","profile":"thetiemensfamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Learning Spanish with dvd or else ?","postDate":"1254068226","msgId":47640,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg5bzM2Mit2b25jQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2MDk5OS4zMDM3NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47632,"nextInTopic":47642,"prevInTime":47639,"nextInTime":47641,"topicId":47587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Regarding Muzzy teaching you are right.

And it&#39;s not unschooling, either.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t a recommendation.  I was trying to suggest that hiring a housekeeper that speaks Spanish, so your kids could learn Spanish wasn&#39;t really the best of ideas.  Housekeepers are supposed to clean house, they aren&#39;t paid to help someone&#39;s child learn Spanish.  If you happen to have someone that comes into your house that speaks Spanish and does work for you and they are chatty and friendly with your kids, then great.<br/>\n<br/>\nHiring a tutor to teach your child Spanish isn&#39;t exactly unschooling.  True too.  When Margaux was about 5 or 6, she wanted to learn French.  It was short lived.  She is still interested in other languages, she would do amazing in a bilingual home, but that&#39;s not what she has!  She played lots of Madeline games and I told her a lot of words that I know in French, and we always read the French labels on things like shampoo and I translate it for her.  One of the little neighbor boy speaks Spanish and Margaux copies the mother&#39;s inflections very well and pronounces the little boy&#39;s name the same way his mother does.  She&#39;s very proud to know how to say the word &quot;candy&quot; in Spanish. (she learned that from hitting a pinata at their house)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Chamille was 6, we were actively involved with a private rec center where they had Spanish classes.  She took some and loved it a lot.  She doesn&#39;t remember much from those classes, but she was the one who wanted to take them, largely because she liked the woman who was teaching them.  She mostly took gymnastics classes during the times that I was teaching dance classes.  The Spanish classes took place in my dance room, so I wasn&#39;t ever teaching during that class and often joined in with her.  They played lots of games, it was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Learning Spanish with dvd or else ?","postDate":"1254000705","msgId":47624,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENDMzJDMTA0LTY5N0MtNEYzMy04MUM0LTE1NDRBMkUxNDVCMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDg2MDk5OS4zMDM3NC5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDYubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5bDc2ayt1NWttQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8ODYwOTk5LjMwMzc0LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwNi5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":47623,"nextInTopic":47625,"prevInTime":47623,"nextInTime":47625,"topicId":47587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-= Hire a Spanish-speaking housecleaner.

But I don&#39;t actually have my drivers license yet, which makes getting around to sales a bit hard. I am assuming thrift stores is the American term for opshops/second hand stores? I have thought about buying games there but assumed some pieces are missing (they tape the boxes up over here.) But 1( I guess I shouldn&#39;t assume and 2) I didn&#39;t think before, I can definately substitute missing pieces anyway! <br/>\n<br/>\nKerrie in Australia.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":152271008,"authorName":"Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"ruekream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] home-made games","postDate":"1253848589","msgId":47591,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNDM0E0QzRDQjkyNzRCRDRCRDMyRjFFNzU4M0JFODM4QHJ1ZXhwcm8+","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5aDdkbitxMjZjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47590,"nextInTopic":47595,"prevInTime":47590,"nextInTime":47592,"topicId":47587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"You can play Mancala using an egg carton and whatever little items you have handy - beans, buttons, coins, etc.  Memory is another good one to make yourself,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-185362629\">You can play Mancala using an egg carton and whatever little items you<br/>\nhave handy - beans, buttons, coins, etc.  Memory is another good one to<br/>\nmake yourself, using photos, pictures or words from magazines/catalogs,<br/>\nor drawings.  ~Rue<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] home-made games","postDate":"1253846687","msgId":47590,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ4NTIyM0RDLTM4RjMtNDRDMC05Q0I5LTVCRjMzNTI4Qzc5Q0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGg5aDdkbitxMjZjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGg5aDdkbitxMjZjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":47588,"nextInTopic":47591,"prevInTime":47589,"nextInTime":47591,"topicId":47587,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe ask on Freecycle, or go to a thrift store and buy some playing cards and a book of card games.
