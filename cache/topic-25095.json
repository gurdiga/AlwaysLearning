As an adult how would you<br/>\nfeel about the &quot;second wife&quot;?  Would you feel an instant happy<br/>\nconnection?  This person is sleeping in your bed, sharing intimate<br/>\ncontact with someone you thought was the Love of Your Life and<br/>\nseemingly appeared out of nowhere or with very little warning...Now<br/>\nthis person is in your kitchen, your dresser drawer, borrowing your<br/>\nmake-up, going through your purse, wearing your clothes and driving<br/>\nyour car...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes this mean you would hit her, scream at her or scheme to stop her<br/>\nusing any and all skills at your disposal?  The three year old who<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have your life experience is in this position.  He isn&#39;t sure<br/>\nhow to control the interloper.  How you deal with him when he feels<br/>\ndisempowered and displaced will impact how he deals with the younger<br/>\nchild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember Rowan wasn&#39;t hitting Martin, but he sure wasn&#39;&#39;t the<br/>\nnurturing big brother I&#39;d seen at the homebirth.  The baby arrived and<br/>\nafter a while it became apparent that this kids was going to be in a<br/>\nsling attached to mom.  Then this kid was suddenly using his things.<br/>\nRowan shared really well as I was very open with possessions and so<br/>\nwas John.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until recently that at fifteen and eleven Rowan became a<br/>\nmore nurturing brother toward Martin.  This has led to Martin<br/>\ndisplaying additional patience with Crispin.  Though Rowan was older<br/>\nwhen Crispin was born(six) we spent a great deal of time discussing<br/>\nhis irrational feelings toward Martin that did not materialize when<br/>\nCrispin was born.  Perhaps child spacing does play a role in how<br/>\nsiblings relate.  Or perhaps Rowan had grown into the big brother role<br/>\nas he had matured. Rowan would put up with Crispin touching things<br/>\nwhen he became mobile, and with his &quot;baby brother&quot; interrupting him<br/>\nand even hurting him in a manner he did not with Martin.  Rowan also<br/>\n&quot;protected&quot; Crispin from Martin--which meant as the mother I had to<br/>\nstep in and advocate for Martin and if not &quot;dictate&quot; behavior or<br/>\nmicromanage every moment spell out in no uncertain terms that<br/>\nsafety(physical and emotional) was our priority with everyone.  Rowan<br/>\ndid by age six recognize his feelings toward Marty were somewhat<br/>\nirrational and they had a lot of good times together.  They do now<br/>\nchoose to spend time together and have similar interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 22/06/2011, Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt; -=-I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m looking for an explanation of why my boys are<br/>\n&gt; fighting soooooo much (I was an only child), ideas of what I can be doing<br/>\n&gt; better, preventing, reacting, understanding?

I know I&#39;m already a better parent because of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m a stay at home mom to three and a half year old and 14 month old boys. For the first year my oldest was loving and caring towards his baby brother. Now the baby is a walking toddler and things have changed. The oldest has been taking toys away, treating him roughly, and acting down right mean to him sometimes. Of course the youngest is now much much more mobile and into things too. For the most part this isn&#39;t like him and sometimes it&#39;s done with such intent that I lose my cool reacting. I know I&#39;m not helping the situation and even in the moment I often see that I should be connecting and showing him how much I love him too but it&#39;s such a trigger that I find myself getting angry and yelling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember telling parents of autistic kids that I worked with in the past not to take things so personally. Now I&#39;m a mom and I see it is so personal. And rightly so. I know that when we are able to connect life is different. But my youngest is such a busy kid. I&#39;m on from the moment he opens his eyes. With my oldest it wasn&#39;t like that so it&#39;s been a challenge. My youngest requires a lot of physical attention. My oldest has always required a lot of emotional attention. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know one part of the puzzle is that prior to kids I&#39;ve always valued my own personal alone time and space. I have virually none now. Not even in the shower. And I am now suspecting I may have lyme&#39;s disease and have yet to make a much needed appointment for this or that reason. My youngest also is an inconsistent sleeper. Naps are not very long, if at all and night time is similar. So I am definitely not operating at the top of my game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m looking for an explanation of why my boys are fighting soooooo much (I was an only child), ideas of what I can be doing better, preventing, reacting, understanding? Figuring out the cause for my own reactions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know why it makes me flip out. My oldest doesn&#39;t take confrontation well. We did time out a few times when he was two and it was a complete joke on me. Finding alternatives to &quot;punishment&quot; is what led me here. We&#39;ve had much more success with comfort and connection. It drives me nuts when I feel like he doesn&#39;t take me seriously though. I see him as malicious, yet I know this isn&#39;t how he feels. I&#39;ve been using the words &quot;I will not let you hit/take things from your brother. And I think it&#39;s a really powerful statement and it has been really key in using it for both in the more physical situations. I&#39;ll say it for things like &quot;I will not let you pull V&#39;s hair&quot; and my oldest automatically feels like I&#39;m making the world right. However reversed I think my oldest feels like I&#39;m making him an outsider. The biggest flip outs come when I say &quot;stop.&quot; I often say it when I know he&#39;s about to do something to hurt his brother or when he already is engaged. Sometimes what he&#39;s doing is intentional. Other times it&#39;s accidental. Often he continues and it ends up making his brother cry. Then I yell something like &quot;didn&#39;t you hear me say stop?&quot; I know it absolutely is not helping. I don&#39;t know what else to say/do/feel. I feel so angry that he hurts his brother, I&#39;m not able to always prevent it and that he actually is acting like an outsider. My oldest is a very sensitive, mostly calm, often compassionate, and mellow guy. He definitely enjoys playing darker roles (since toddler days) like being the scary dinosaur, tiger, batman, ect. He often resents being a kid and has often told me he wants to be a grown up. Even though he&#39;s allowed to do most things he gets a kick out of asking me if he can have this or that and hearing me say yes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know he needs me more. I&#39;m having trouble giving him more. I feel like I&#39;m failing him sometimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is in the picture. He&#39;s a great dad, involved and supportive. He does travel and work a lot and needs a lot of down time himself. He was one of six and his response is that it&#39;s normal. But even if the fighing is &quot;normal&quot; I know my response is hurting my relationship with my child. And I really do have high hopes of them finding a best friend in each other. My husband is not very close to any of his siblings. Though is life was full of trauma. Mine was in a different way so I know that could be just one more piece?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry it&#39;s so long winded. I&#39;m just trying to do some brainstorming as I write. I did read Sandra&#39;s &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; link but I felt they are too little to apply most of those thoughts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you.

My 16 yr old stepdaughter was raised in the very &quot;traditional&quot; way by me and my husband.  And she has always gone to school.  Now here I am raising her 4 siblings in a different way.  And while my sd and I have an excellent relationship (she calls me mom and considers me her mom more than her own mother) I know that she has some jealousy towards her siblings, especially her younger sister.  First of all, her parents are divorced and don&#39;t get along at all, me and dh are married.  Her siblings &quot;get away with more&quot; (from her perspective on how she was raised), and have more freedom.  Admittedly my husband was (and still can be) very authoritarian so my sd grew up with the whole adult/child paradigm.  I was a bit looser, and dh has loosened up as well.  So I know that my sd feels like she got the sh*t end of the stick.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI was just thinking about all of this in light of the &quot;it&#39;s too late&quot; conversation.  I do my best to keep an open relationship with my sd - we talk about everything.
