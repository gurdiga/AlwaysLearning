They both lived through WWII in the UK with ration books extending into the 1950s.

David is much better at dealing with his parents than I will ever be, so he does most of that. As Simon and Linnaea have gotten older they have been much better at recognizing the limitations of a visit with their grandparents.

What do you do when visiting friends or family who won&#39;t let your children eat between meals?  It makes me nuts. My children know when they&#39;re hungry and aren&#39;t just eating because they&#39;re glutinous pigs.

For me food was the *first* thing that came...it happened even before I took my kids out of school. And I believe my perspective change there helped pave the way for a perspective change on the academic/learning end of things. (along with other influences)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is how it unfolded for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the kids were young holidays were always particularly stress inducing...mostly because of food issues. My middle son, Griffin, was a extremely &quot;picky&quot; eater (and generally a strongly free thinking, nonconformist individual) and none of my family approved of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of you really have to teach him this or that. You really need to get him in control etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne time we were at a holiday dinner at a family members home...Christmas maybe. I had already decided I was going to let my kids eat whatever they wanted...but was feeling uneasy about following through...then...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy aunt has three kids the same ages of mine. I watched my her dish out for for her kids...mashed potatoes with gravy & butter, rolls with butter, green beans, ham, turkey with gravy...etc --- her kids asked if they could have some of the fruit salad (fresh cut, no sugar added beautiful fruit salad). She said, &quot;No, you have to eat the meal first.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt boggled my mind that someone would have to eat the &quot;unhealthy&quot; foods before the healthy foods. It felt like there was no purpose other than to control the kids. I mean, my thought *had* always been at least it made some sort of sense to eat a &quot;healthy&quot; dinner before ice cream or some other &quot;unhealthy&quot; dessert. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we often have ice cream for dinner or burritos for breakfast and nothing for dessert. <br/>\n<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Switch to: Text-Only, Daily Digest .

His only close relative, an uncle who lives in the same town we do, cut him off after his mother&#39;s funeral because he was in a same-sex relationship at the time (never mind that his lover had spent at least the year before his mother&#39;s cancer diagnosis living with David&#39;s parents and caring for them while David was out of state in school.

I think my own experiences with that disapproval or enforced silence or lack of acceptance (and David&#39;s, too) makes me less sentimental about biological family than a lot of people are. My kids aren&#39;t close to my parents, although we see them a few times a year, because my parents aren&#39;t people you can get close to.

When my kids hear someone in the kitchen they gravitate towards it and ask or look for food.  So when at my moms i can of direct the kids toward the table so they are not under her feet and provide some snacks, mostly cut up veggies and fruit or crackers for them to nibble on while she cooks. Typically that makes everyone happy.  I have also just made them their dinner earlier and fed them all and told my mom it was so we (the adults) could eat and talk without worrying about the kids.

Restricting or forcing food crosses the line, for me, from the person who is boss of the house having authority to the person who is boss of the body having authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nA person does have authority in her home. But, as an adult, I can choose whether to go to that home and submit myself to that authority. I was willing to choose not to see my parents for awhile because my father could not understand the limits on his authority over me once I was an adult; most people I know are not willing to make that decision, but honestly (this is not aimed at the OP by any means) I think sometimes adult children continue to let their parents define the relationship long after they should take some control of it. I have one friend, for instance, who still speaks to her mother every day even though all her mother does is criticize her choices (down to the level of what she&#39;s serving her kids for lunch). She complains endlessly to her friends about the latest crappy thing her mother said to her, and when everyone suggests the obvious--that she cut down on the phone calls, or not tell her mother what she&#39;s serving for lunch, or whatever, she says that&#39;s impossible. Sometimes I just like to remind people that it actually is possible. You can choose to set limits with your parents or not, but I think it&#39;s healthy to recognize that you have that option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this kind of thing takes discernment--one of my favorite words, very useful, and applicable in an unschooling context. It has to do with sorting out what to do in a complicated situation. Relationships are complicated. When I was young, I somehow thought all friendships should be pretty much perfect; as I&#39;ve gotten older, I&#39;ve learned that in many relationships, there&#39;s a complicated calculus of deciding whether a relationship is worth it, that some friends can be counted on for certain things and others can&#39;t, or that you may love this person to death but their habit of always being at least an hour late is something you&#39;re going to have to decide to put up with if you&#39;re going to keep the relationship (and you might make a different decision for someone who was always late that you didn&#39;t love quite so much).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OP&#39;s situation is complicated because there is this one issue in what otherwise sounds like a good relationship. But if the mother-in-law can&#39;t adapt herself, I would look to other options than submitting to her authority in her home. I would not sneak around, but I would feed my kids. I might stay in a hotel instead of at her house and visit for limited times. I would absolutely not again leave my child alone in my mother-in-law&#39;s care, at least for awhile, because I wouldn&#39;t leave my kids with any person I didn&#39;t think could be trusted to do something so basic as feed him when he was hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n*shrug* But what do I know? My partner&#39;s parents had the good grace to die a year before I started seeing him, so I don&#39;t have in-law issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSu, mom to Eric, 8; Carl, 6; Yehva, 2.5<br/>\ntapeflags.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Meal time restrictions","postDate":"1273841391","msgId":54117,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxNkQ4QTdDLUM4RUUtNDRENi1BREJFLTc2MTIxQTY5M0ZBMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzaW5ydSttcGFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhzaW5ydSttcGFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54115,"nextInTopic":54120,"prevInTime":54116,"nextInTime":54118,"topicId":54105,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I agree, this is my Mother in Law s house - I m okay with her everyone at the table for meals rule, and her no jumping on my sofas rule and her get off","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-707197658\">-=-I agree, this is my Mother in Law&#39;s house - I&#39;m okay with her  <br/>\n&#39;everyone at the<br/>\ntable for meals&#39; rule, and her &#39;no jumping on my sofas&#39; rule and her  <br/>\n&#39;get off my<br/>\ncoffee table this instant&#39; rule.

And I&#39;m sorry, adults are allowed to not like certain types of food, why aren&#39;t children?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve started bringing a hoard of snacks in our luggage and the kids sneak into the guest room to eat a granola bar or something to tide them over until the official meal time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot our stash last week and my six year old was crying at the counter while his grandmother cooked dinner.  She refused to let him nibble so much as a piece of bread. I had gone out to run an errand or I would have marched in there and given him what he wanted.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we all sat down to eat, he downed four full platefuls of rice, meatballs, and heaps of green beans.  She was floored. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh, I guess he really was hungry?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nUm, yes. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Jessica</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54171,"nextTopicId":54208}}
