School is designed to convince us all -- kids and parents alike -- that schedules, organized socialization, and grades are necessary, even good.  <br/>\n <br/>\nWhen people find out we&#39;re homeschoolers, they&#39;re quick to extoll the wonderful things about school, and share their concerns about what our kids are &#39;missing.&#39;  They try to pass that off as support for schooling, but when we we extoll the virtues of keeping our kids home, we&#39;re called school-bashers.  I wonder if they see themselves as natural life-bashers.  It&#39;s all about semantics and politics. <br/>\n <br/>\nI used to fantasize about my brother and sister seeing our life and choosing to homeschool their kids.  I&#39;ve realized they just aren&#39;t there yet.  My brother&#39;s a single dad and his kids were terribly neglected by their Mom when she had custody (he only regained custody a little less than 2 yrs ago) so they need school in a way my kids don&#39;t.  My sister is very swept up in the pre-honors group her 12yo son is in and can&#39;t imagine why I wouldn&#39;t send my kids to school.  She actually went to work in a daycare center when her daughter was 4 because her daughter could go along for free and it would give her playmates.  What -- are there no playgroups in Ft. Worth? No other stay at home Moms with 4yo girls?  Sure there are, but the unquestioned choice is easier.  This way she gets 7 hrs a day (full-day kindergarten) to herself.  What she does with it, I don&#39;t know -- it&#39;s not like she&#39;s involved in anything outside the house, and her house is a mess!<br/>\n <br/>\nSo I concentrate on being available to the kids.  When my 15yo nephew says &#39;school sucks&#39; I say, &#39;yeah, it does.  That&#39;s why my kids don&#39;t go.&#39;  Maybe I can be the cool aunt who gives them permission to do what they want (and a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook!).<br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!

It bothers her to no end that I no <br/>\nlonger make my children eat anything they don&#39;t want to and that they <br/>\noften stay up till all hours of the night to be with me.  She claims <br/>\nthat she needs her own time to herself, so she would never stop <br/>\nenforcing bedtimes.  I think that&#39;s so sad because she works all day <br/>\nwhile they&#39;re in a very regimented daycare and only sees them for a <br/>\ncouple of hours.  Of course, they couldn&#39;t stay up too late, now, <br/>\nbecause the daycare refuses to let them sleep for any reason outside of <br/>\nthe allotted nap times.   UGH.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo wish us luck.  She&#39;s planning to stop working when the baby&#39;s born. <br/>\n Of course she&#39;s also planning to go back to school for her next career <br/>\nas a acupuncturist.<br/>\nShe&#39;s a career woman, through and through.  But she&#39;s watching my <br/>\nchildren and she&#39;s had so many problems with issues and sickness from <br/>\nthe daycare.  Oh,  I&#39;m so hopeful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing, can anyone recommend a book or article that focuses <br/>\ncompletely on unschooling without bashing the ps school system?  That&#39;s <br/>\nwhat she keeps asking me for and everything I have eventually or <br/>\nblatantly tears into ps school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,  Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19322,"nextTopicId":19352}}
