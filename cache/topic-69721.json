But 10 years -- maybe less -- those kids will be in management. They&#39;ll be the ones deciding about that world, steering it, shaping it. They&#39;ll see the world through they eyes of video game players, texters, app downloaders, kids who&#39;ve had instant access to movies as well as answers to what they want to know, stored what they own in the Cloud. That&#39;s the knowledge they will use to shape the world. Parents who keep their kids away from technology handicap them. Their kids will be more oriented to the way things are done in the 20th century -- or 19th! -- than the 21st. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":359707411,"authorName":"Robyn Coburn","from":"Robyn Coburn &lt;dezignarob@...&gt;","profile":"dezignarob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: learning to read","postDate":"1354647396","msgId":69729,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTzlNeTRIaT1TNjZqNlBEUGd4anUydDh1NFI5UlpPK1F0OVVDaFFGNDNmN3AxQlZPd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":69727,"nextInTopic":69730,"prevInTime":69728,"nextInTime":69730,"topicId":69721,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I did go and make a reply.

Map reading and storybooks aren&#39;t connected, but games have maps, or at least a spatial element.  Checkers, Settlers of Catan, Trans Europe, Eureka (just to name some games I can see from here) have movement over space, with changes happening on each turn.  A dynamic map.  Video games are often dynamic maps.  The player moves, makes decisions, and the maps change.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty has been working for Target for a while now, stocking shelves early in the morning.  4:00 a.m. sometimes, or 4:30, or 5:00--depends on the size of shipment that&#39;s coming in.

Today he found out he&#39;s being seriously considered for a promotion, to be the guy who puts labels on the shelves so the stockers know where to put things.  This is a dynamic mapping situation, too.  The store changes seasonally, and by promotions and &quot;back to school&quot; and such.  Christmas sales take up a large part of the store right now, and those will all come down quickly.   The decisions of where things go aren&#39;t made in the store.  They get a map.  Marty is GREAT at reading maps, thanks to a lifetime of video games, board games, collectible card games, playing on the internet with mapquest and google maps and Google Earth, of road maps and exploring in his jeep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could have said &quot;no games, no driving aimless around central New Mexico; you STUDY.&quot;  But there is not, was not, will not be anything that was better preparation for the job he&#39;s probably about to start doing after Christmas.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKirby learned to read maps from a player&#39;s guide for the original Mario game.
