But I wasn&#39;t able to think  <br/>\nabout that when I was first homeschooling because I had three little kids  <br/>\n(5, 2 <br/>\nand not quite born) and it was hard to think of much of anything  very <br/>\nclearly.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n***We had a similiar situation.  When I started having the kids at  home in <br/>\n1981 in our military community - I was the &quot;freak&quot;.  Since Russ had  to spend <br/>\ntime with his co-workers he didn&#39;t have the wonderful peer support I  did in La <br/>\nLeche League and in our little homeschooling once a month group.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;d tell him about what I was reading, and what was happening with our kids  <br/>\nand in other families.  Years later he would come home and tell me how he  had <br/>\nadvised co-workers about family sleeping, etc.  Once his boss had a  reading <br/>\nspecialist as a wife, and their youngest son was struggling to  read.  Russ <br/>\ntold him about our late readers and etc etc.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt is a gradual process, but well worth the effort!<br/>\n <br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21328,"nextTopicId":21340}}
