You could also have other medical play equipment at home for him, like a doctor puppet or a doll/stuffed animal upon whom he could practice treatments, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell wishes,<br/>\nJen in Michigan<br/>\nMom to Cutter, age 11.5</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling and medications or medical concerns","postDate":"1329864703","msgId":65830,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGppMTc1dittY28yQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGppMGVmYStidjJzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65826,"nextInTopic":65839,"prevInTime":65829,"nextInTime":65831,"topicId":65804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ************************ If it s easier on your son, ask that you be allowed to do as much of the hands-on stuff as possible, and for the medical staff to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-969387949\">&quot;bellumswife77&quot; &lt;stefanie@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt; He is rejecting ALL of it.

She only used it for a day or two, and then it seemed that being in a hot steamy bathroom was good enough, and far more enjoyable, so we spent a lot of time in the bath for the next few days. You could find some new and interesting videos for him to watch while he sits on your lap breathing too. Maybe build a little fort out of sheets and sit under that with him.

I would do my best to keep him out of the ER and doctor&#39;s office, then. These are things we did, some worked with both kids, some worked with only one:<br/>\n<br/>\nCold moist air relaxed my oldest, so we spent many, MANY nights walking with him in the sling or stroller just up and down the street. We figured as long as we could keep him calm, we could avoid a trip to the ER and head to the more familiar pediatrician the next day. Driving in the car with the windows down also worked, so I knew where all the 24 hour pharmacies and drive-thrus were. My pediatrician said as long as it was below 55 (if I&#39;m remembering correctly) the cold air would help relax his airway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe got a nebulizer for home and got a prescription for saline &quot;bullets&quot; to use in it, so we could let him breath the moist air from that. He hated the mask, so I would hold the tube attachment near his face while he nursed or sat in my lap watching a video.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe hated the heat, so shower steam never worked for him, but some kids  find it soothing. (Didn&#39;t work for my daughter either, but because the noise of the shower bothered her.)<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping kids calm is one of the most helpful things you can do, which is why we ended up in the ER with my daughter so many times. Just a completely different temperament from my son, and there was very little we could do to calm her once she had the sensation of struggling for breath. So for her I went the route of getting a prescription for oral steroid to keep on hand. The liquid tastes god-awful and was very difficult to get her to take, so we got chewables and she definitely preferred those. They also are better for travel, so that&#39;s a plus, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith her we&#39;d give her the steroid at the first sign of croup. It takes a full 8 hours to be fully effective, so waiting until the croup is full-blown is usually too late (though you will see improvement in the first hour or so). I&#39;m the type of person that would much prefer not to give medication, but I figured that giving her a couple days or oral steroids at home was preferable to having to go to the ER in the middle of the night for adrenaline shots, steroids, etc. and pick up what ever germs are floating around the hospital as a bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did not like stroller or sling rides in the night air, and car rides freaked her out even more, so we&#39;d bundle up and sleep on the porch together or sometimes throw open her windows and close off her room from the rest of the house.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark chocolate is a great cough suppressant and works well for bribes to get them through medicine they don&#39;t want to take. My son couldn&#39;t stand the taste of inhaled steroids, so on the rare occasion that we had to give them we&#39;d have a bowl of chocolate chips waiting for him for the second he was done with the treatment.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeppermint oil mixed with a carrier and rubbed on the bottoms of the feet also seems to help ease coughing at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nLicorice root tea is great for coughs and colds, and is sort of a natural steroid.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere I you, I&#39;d work with my pediatrician (or naturopath, whichever route you want to go) to get a game plan in place so that you can treat respiratory issues as proactively and quickly as possible and avoid the ER and x-rays, etc. as much as possible. And if there are things that can&#39;t be avoided, the practicing when he&#39;s well and not in distress and making them as jolly and/or relaxing as possible when he is will hopefully go a long way to helping him through until he gets a little older.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing I thought about. Watch out for doctors, especially in the ER, acting like he&#39;s not there. When my youngest was having an emergency surgery when she was 18 months old, the surgeon came in to explain things to me, but he stood kind of behind her head, and then rested his hands on the railing of the bed and gestured with them rather close to her face. Once I asked him to move he was apologetic and really was just great with her, but he was much more focused on the task of explaining the surgery to me than the fact that he was doing so in a way that was making his patient very uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck,<br/>\nAngela in NJ<br/>\nwith Joseph, 9; Hannah, 7; and Miriam, 4</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and medications or medical concerns","postDate":"1329845319","msgId":65813,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEMwODMwQTY2LUQ5ODUtNDQ2Ny1BRDU1LTg0NUU3RDk0RDI1OEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGppMGhjYitzMWg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGppMGhjYitzMWg1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65812,"nextInTopic":65814,"prevInTime":65812,"nextInTime":65814,"topicId":65804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
