I just got a big packet of thank you notes <br/>\nfrom the kids in Mo Palmer&#39;s classes at Sandia Prep.   They&#39;re for three <br/>\nthings, in various combinations. The loan of chain mail (my husband let them use a <br/>\nchain mail coif and two or three little samples of different weaves, a few <br/>\nweeks back), for copies of coloring pages on medieval topics from coloring books <br/>\nI&#39;ve had for years, and for the dictionary game (which is the only work I <br/>\ndid).<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve looked at 8 or 10 of them.  They&#39;re mostly illustrated with art, some <br/>\ntraced from the medieval coloring books, some hand-done, lots colored with <br/>\ncolored pencils.  Some are in folded card form (French fold, for card afficionados) <br/>\nor just letters, or fancy folds.  Some used markers.  Some are kind of <br/>\ncalligraphed (untrained-kid-style), some are cursive, some printed.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome are sealed with stickers or tape, and I&#39;m saving those for Holly to open <br/>\nbecause the packet was to &quot;The Dodd Family,&quot; and I noticed one person <br/>\naddressed Holly, so I&#39;ll save the rest until she&#39;s awake.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here are some interesting quotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Mrs. Dodd, thank you for playing the dictionary game.  Holly, it was pretty <br/>\ncool of you to come and help your mom.  Thanks again.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It was so fun (the dictionary game)...I wish that we had more time so you <br/>\ncould teach us more.  I just can&#39;t express how much I think you and enjoyed your <br/>\nlesson....What you taught us changed my whole idea on history, in a good <br/>\nway.&quot;  (That last bit included the chain mail and pictures.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this one was just about the dictionary game, and just to me:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Thank you for the magnificent job you did for us yesterday.  It must take a <br/>\nlong time to do what you do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE THAT!  &quot;It must take a long time to do what you do.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that goes with the &quot;How did she LEARN all this stuff?&quot; overheard that <br/>\nday.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m thinking of writing back and telling them how long I&#39;ve been interested <br/>\nin the history of words.  I was nine, and in 4th grade.  I played with <br/>\ndictionaries from that time to now.  I read a book on etymology in 4th grade, and just <br/>\nkept on whenever I had a chance.  It was &quot;a personal interest.&quot;  A hobby?  <br/>\nNo, because it was considered scholarly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI need to figure out how to say that in a useful way to committed-to-school <br/>\nkids.  It&#39;s an opportunity to put a good clue into the minds of many receptive <br/>\nfuture parents (and to change their learning perspective on their own learning <br/>\nnow).   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18702,"nextTopicId":18730}}
