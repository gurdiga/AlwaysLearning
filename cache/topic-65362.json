How do you in a partnership way<br/>\ndeal with that?***<br/>\n<br/>\nIn just considering this one statement/question, it sounds like you were not partnering with him to keep things safe.  I don&#39;t mean that to come off harshly, but it is something that should be addressed.  I just don&#39;t understand why a BB gun would be in the house?  That really has nothing to do with unschooling and saying yes more when it is a safety hazard.  Saying yes more would be to use the gun at appropriate times and places whenever he asked to do so.  My 8.5 year old son also has a bb gun.  It is kept out in the pole barn.  NEVER in the house so I would never need to say &quot;don&#39;t point guns at the TV.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband hunts and has a few guns.  The guns are kept unloaded and locked up.  My oldest son is interested in guns and hunting so my husband spends time with him doing those things.  My son, Luke,  is very aware of gun dangers and how to be safe but we don&#39;t leave it all up to him.  We are there with him, and keep the gun out doors for safe use. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf my 8.5 wanted to drive - it would not be safe to say &quot;YES, here are the keys.&quot;  However, we might be able to simulate driving by going go carting or playing mario kart.  Maybe though, it is just that he wants to drive a car for real and hates that he has to wait until he is old enough to take drivers ed or whatever he needs to do.  In that case, I just need to listen, understand that and hear his desire and validate him.  That is partnering.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPutting it another way with regard to things not getting broken:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4 sons; 8.5, 6. 3.75 and 1.  We have 3 computers for my sons to use.  They enjoy them very much.  My youngest is 3.75 and has his own computer now.  There were times before where he used my laptop.  When he got frustrated he often would bang on the keys.  I would sit with him and help him with the games (or get his something  to eat, drink etc if that was a factor feeding the frustration).  But there were many times where I just had to close it up and put it away for a bit.  I would spend the time with him doing something else; playing a game, wrestling him or just holding him.  It was not a rule and he was not being punished.  As his partner, I could not stand by while he potentially broke the laptop.   No lecture or shaming - just got to the point  and told him he couldn&#39;t do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would not serve anyone to have a broken computer.  At the same time I had to consider what might be leading to his frustrations.  Being the mom of 4 young boys, I am busy with one of them most of the time so it is possible that he was needing more of me in those moments (or the moments leading up to the frustration).  He also is VERY computer/game savvy for his age but finds himself on  website with very hard games or rules that are not easily figured out by just playing it.  So in those instances I needed to sit and read the instructions and play it for a bit, or validate his frustrations, or call it a stupid game or something silly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBUT if he was still banging on the computer, or I could get there in time to buffer the other things leading up to the major frustration then I I would close the laptop or move to a desktop or Wii or just breath with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn case point is not coming through - there are many things/layers to look at and deal with as a partner/facilitator to your children.  It might not be one answer or a variety of things to do on a daily basis.  However, it is still my responsibility to keep the environment safe, and expensive items such as computers and TVs out of harms way so they can be used and enjoyed by everyone for their purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ***When he directly does not comply with this.

They have more energy, are more impulsive.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister&#39;s older boy is like that. She kept him home for a couple of years after a disastrous 2 months in 1st grade. <br/>\nHe is back in school now.<br/>\nMy sister never really got how much she needed to be there all the time. It was hard for her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis past Summer there was  a family emergency and my sister flew out to California and left her two boys with me. I knew I had to be with them every minute. I knew I had to  facilitate every play between them and between them and my kids. I had to be present and attuned. Things went smoothly but after 4 days I had to take my nephews to the park and leave my kids at home so they could take a break from each other.<br/>\nHer oldest son has a lot of energy and needs a lot of you. He sounds like your son in some ways. I could not sit down and write this e-mail with him around.<br/>\nIt was not horrible by no means. It was just different than my children who are much easier and mellow . When my son was much younger I did spend all the time with him like that but he has grown and changed. My nephew did not get the same thing. Not that my sister is not there.. She just does not get how to be there and ready and preventing  and avoiding situations . She just never got that she needed more connection in a different way. <br/>\nWhen her son was little she said a lot of no&#39;s, punished and even spanked in a regular basis. <br/>\n<br/>\nI always said her son needed more of her. Not just to stop when the boys are fighting but to be with them , attentive and recognize when things are going to go south so she could prevent and stop situations before they escalated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very draining but so worth it.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":361639019,"authorName":"joanne.lopers","from":"&quot;joanne.lopers&quot; &lt;wilmalv@...&gt;","profile":"joanne.lopers","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"BB Guns","postDate":"1328220824","msgId":65373,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpnZjFxbytmNTEwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDgxRjVDOUZFLTg5MDktNENFRS1BQzc5LUQ3REU2QkIyM0VEN0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":65372,"nextInTopic":65374,"prevInTime":65372,"nextInTime":65374,"topicId":65362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The targets in the house are for Nerf guns, should have said that.

He didn&#39;t learn to be careful by having things break, he learned not to value delicate things. It helped him to have durable things around and remove breakables for a few years. It helped to find lots of ways for him to play outside. It helped to look for damaged toys in free bins and even dumpsters so that he could play with them until they broke without any grief.

That kind of knowledge can go some way to helping you see when you can expect something to get broken and when you should be more present. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n From: joanne.lopers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:wilmalv@...\">wilmalv@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Thursday, 2 February 2012, 18:18<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] (unknown)<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 10 year old shot our lap top with a bb gun bullet last night while watching a show in his room and broke the screen. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] (unknown)","postDate":"1328209274","msgId":65366,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg4RDhBNTU2LUQwRUItNDBDOS1BOURGLTY4REU5MDM5RTE2RkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBRzRDMlktOWVDK3RYb05PTV9NSFVITU1kWE5KR1pUemZ1TGRQQkFHLWVMTDczSHhYQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGpnZWsxcStlbzJrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MUE0QTAxODMtMjc0OS00NTBFLTlFMTEtRjExOEE4MEY4ODE0QGNvbWNhc3QubmV0PiA8Q0FHNEMyWS05ZUMrdFhvTk9NX01IVUhNTWRYTkpHWlR6ZnVMZFBCQUctZUxMNzNIeFhBQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65365,"nextInTopic":65367,"prevInTime":65365,"nextInTime":65367,"topicId":65362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Not only would I not allow use of a gun in the house, I would not be replacing things he broke.
