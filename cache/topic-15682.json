Although I have not been active much ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1827375752\">I don&#39;t think Sandra needs defending, so this is not<br/>\nreally a defense.  I&#39;m just offering my experiences<br/>\nfor perusal.  Although I have not been active much<br/>\nlately, perhaps some people remember me.  I joined the<br/>\ninfamous dotcomedy routine when there were only<br/>\nsomething like three people there, and my first<br/>\nmessage was asking where everyone was, only to learn<br/>\nthe list was only a few days old.  Then a couple of<br/>\nyears later Sandra started this list for us refugees<br/>\nwho were sick of the ol&#39; duck and cover over there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all that time on the other list, and here, I can&#39;t<br/>\nsay that I have experienced Sandra to be<br/>\nsanctimonious, unschoolier-than-thou, or self<br/>\nrighteous.  She can be very passionate, which some<br/>\npeople misunderstand or just plain can&#39;t deal with.  I<br/>\ncan certainly sympathize from personal experience of<br/>\nhaving my passion misconstrued, or just being attacked<br/>\nfor passionatly sharing my beliefs or opinions or<br/>\nexperiences.  But I certainly think it&#39;s worth noting<br/>\nthat on this list, we just plain have never had a<br/>\nfirestorm that I recall, and this is Sandra&#39;s list. <br/>\nIt&#39;s not censored, and she&#39;s not a list nazi, and we<br/>\nare free to share differing opinions.  So that seems<br/>\nincontrovertible proof that the true self-righteous<br/>\ntroublemakers are residing elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, to the new Pamela, I can understand how much<br/>\nnervousness and trepidation are involved in entering a<br/>\nnew social arena and how easy it can be to make<br/>\ninnocent blunders.  You are not unwanted.  But be<br/>\naware, this is not really a list for beginners to<br/>\nlearn about Unschooling, as I am sure that Sandra gets<br/>\ntired of reiterating.  This is the safe place for old<br/>\nhats to support each other in a lifestyle that we all<br/>\nunderstand.  Beginners are welcome, if they understand<br/>\nthat this is not really the place to couch questions<br/>\nin terms of &quot;Does this really work?&quot;  and &quot;How will my<br/>\nkids learn anything?&quot;  There are a lot of other places<br/>\nfor that.  This is a much needed, friendly, back door<br/>\nrespite for those who really GROK Unschooling as a<br/>\nlifestyle and don&#39;t want to argue or reinvent the<br/>\nwheel.  You are welcome, of course, to that same kind<br/>\nof everyday commisseration and support.  There really<br/>\nis a lot to be learned just from osmosis, as it were,<br/>\nfrom all the fabulous Unschoolers here, and lots of<br/>\nmoral support and pep to be gleaned from folks&#39;<br/>\neveryday sharingings.
