Being a little bit &quot;out of sync&quot; is normal in that sense ;)  <br/>\n<br/>\n The book has some wonderful lists of activities for kids - really grat stuff for any parent who need more ideas for physical things to do with a child and they&#39;re grouped in ways that are helpful. A child who likes to spend a lot of time bouncing, for instance, will tend to prefer different activities from a child who swings his arms (and maybe hits) a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":134203985,"authorName":"jblmiclette@yahoo.com","from":"&quot;jblmiclette@...&quot; &lt;jblmiclette@...&gt;","profile":"jblmiclette","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] sensory integration","postDate":"1312237804","msgId":62142,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTIyMzc4MDQuOTI4MzAuWWFob29NYWlsQ2xhc3NpY0B3ZWIxMjA3MTcubWFpbC5uZTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGoxNnJuMythMHI0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62141,"nextInTopic":62144,"prevInTime":62141,"nextInTime":62143,"topicId":62135,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am still very new to unschooling so I am not sure if what we chose to do is in keeping with unschooling philosophies (ie. not labeling and such) but we DID","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1511262760\">I am still very new to unschooling so I am not sure if what we chose to do is in keeping with unschooling philosophies (ie. not labeling and such) but we DID seek out an OT for our DS (who is currently 4) last December for a sensory processing disorder.  Our son was having really severe problems, though.   Last fall he was having meltdowns that would last anywhere from 4-6 hours multiple times day and we were at a loss on what to do.  No amount of gentle empathy and adjusting his environment seemed to help.  Walking across the floor and *almost* tripping would set him off.  Brushing his arm against a wall would set him off.  I wound up spending hours a day just holding and rocking him while he screamed and screamed and screamed.   His body was just too disorganized.  We wound up seeing a fantastic OT (who we still see) who had us do a very special deep pressure technique (that should only be done with a professional) and it was amazing. <br/>\n Within three weeks his meltdowns had stopped.  THat being said, after that we have pretty much just done fun sensory activites and heavy work (pushing pulling, etc . . . ) which we probably could do on our own.  But he loves our OT and asks to go so we keep seeing her. <br/>\n <br/>\nJoanne<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- On Mon, 8/1/11, railyuh &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:railyuh@...\">railyuh@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom: railyuh &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:railyuh@...\">railyuh@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] sensory integration<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nDate: Monday, August 1, 2011, 11:36 AM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering if anyone here has experienced sensory issues (sensory integration/sensory processing disorder) with their children?
