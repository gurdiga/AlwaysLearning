Charlie (3) said &#39;that sounds like a trumpet&#39; and I commented that you actually play a trumpet by blowing a raspberry into the mouthpiece (I think you do anyway - more or less!).<br/>\n<br/>\nJack (5) didn&#39;t believe me so I showed him footage of Louis Armstrong on YouTube.  We moved on to other brass instruments (seeing them in his band and through links to other videos) and then spotted a cartoon linked to the video.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt turned out to be an ancient &#39;Betty Boop&#39; cartoon  with the music done by a very young Louis Armstrong and band- very strange video where Ms Boop is in a jungle being chased by &#39;savages&#39; in grass skirts who try to cook her and her friends in a pot.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe &#39;savages&#39; are frequently inter-cut with live footage of Armstrong and his band (the canibal cook stirring the pot relates to the drummer playing his drum for example)- references to their skin colour I assumed.  He&#39;s singing &#39;I&#39;ll be glad when you&#39;re dead, you rascal you&#39;.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting talk about how ideas of what is acceptable/funny change over time.  Jack asking why Armstrong would let them make him look scary and stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo music, social history, ethics, humour... all from fart noises.<br/>\n<br/>\nI doubt many people would think that making fart noises could lead there, and second because I think even fewer would consider a five year old capable of talking intelligently about that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was nice, so I thought I&#39;d share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":54984,"nextTopicId":55024}}
