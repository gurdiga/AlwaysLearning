My son went through a few infrequent<br/>\nexpressions of wanting to hurt himself if he didn&#39;t<br/>\nget his way.  My response, was to hold him closely,<br/>\ntell him i love him, and show how sad i was to see him<br/>\ndo that.  I told him it was my job to protect him, and<br/>\ni wasn&#39;t going to let him hurt himself. So i rocked<br/>\nhim, cuddled him, nursed him.  I directed his<br/>\nanger/frustration outwards to hitting pillows, or<br/>\ngiving him the language that could help him articulate<br/>\nhis feelings.  I matched his intonations with equal<br/>\npassion when he verbalized &quot;I want to...&quot;,  I repeated<br/>\nhis statements to let him know i heard him.  I<br/>\naffirmed his right to be angry.  And because i loved<br/>\nhim it was my job to keep him safe.  He seemed to get<br/>\nit, and let it go as an option. <br/>\n<br/>\n It sounds to me like your solution is very similar. <br/>\nYou surround her with love, and let her know it is sad<br/>\nfor you when she hurts herself.  Repeating the injury<br/>\non yourself, is dramatic.  My only concern is that it<br/>\nmight be hard to understand why mommy can do it and<br/>\nnot her, but it sounds like she is getting the<br/>\nunderlying message which is both mommy and she should<br/>\nnot hurt themselves.  I would say trust your intuition<br/>\non this one, and observe her response.  The comment by<br/>\nanother list member about being careful about<br/>\ntherapists is a good one.  As a counselor myself, i<br/>\nhate to say that there are many professionals out<br/>\nthere that are not child centered, and are quick to<br/>\nlabel and create more problem than previously existed.<br/>\n Having said all that, it is a gem to find a truly AP<br/>\ncentered therapist who provides the needed help. <br/>\nSomeone mentioned Jan Hunt.  Jan is wonderful.  I have<br/>\nspoken with her and she is great.  I found her<br/>\nparticular useful for information and resouces, as<br/>\nwell as normalizing the sometimes unheard of<br/>\nbehaviours that our children sometimes choose.  If you<br/>\nwere wanting to do your own deep work around an issue<br/>\nhowever, then someone else might be a better choice,<br/>\nas i found Jan to be more of an educator than a<br/>\ntherapist.  (This might be perfect)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my response to you I  didn&#39;t mean for it to  sound<br/>\nlike I definately thought that you were &quot;unparenting&quot;,<br/>\nhowever i did wonder if healthy boundaries were in<br/>\nplace. I am glad to hear that they are. You are<br/>\nabsolutely right when you say &quot;you can&#39;t always do as<br/>\nshe demands&quot;, and your statement let&#39;s me know that<br/>\nyou do have boundaries with her.  The video choice,<br/>\neven though it is Disney, still concerns me.  It is<br/>\nnot a choice that i would make. Even though the self<br/>\nhurting behaviour began before the videos started i<br/>\nwould still be very selective about showing them. I am<br/>\ncurious to know what harm you think could come from<br/>\nlimiting her viewing or something that potentially may<br/>\nbe disturbing to her?  I agree with the other reader<br/>\nthat said she might be a wonderfully sensitive child<br/>\nwho has difficultly processing the images in these<br/>\nvideos.  However, above all, I think that after<br/>\ngathering all the information, you are the best one to<br/>\nmake the decision for your child, and you will <br/>\nultimately know what is best.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny way Heidi,  I wish you the best.  blessings, mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Message: 14<br/>\n&gt;    Date: Mon, 24 May 2004 13:42:05 -0400<br/>\n&gt;    From: badolbilz &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ynxn96@...\">ynxn96@...</a>&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: thoughts about kids hurting themselves.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you, Mary.  We have changed our lifestyle<br/>\n&gt; since becoming <br/>\n&gt; unschoolers, but not to a point of outright<br/>\n&gt; unparenting, which is what I <br/>\n&gt; suspect you read into it.  My comment on her perhaps<br/>\n&gt; picking up violence <br/>\n&gt; from movies was based on movies like Sinbad and<br/>\n&gt; other cartoon-types <br/>\n&gt; where someone gets killed.  Perhaps she&#39;s not ready<br/>\n&gt; for these things, <br/>\n&gt; but she is interested in watching them and I feel it<br/>\n&gt; would be more <br/>\n&gt; harmful to forbid these things than to let her<br/>\n&gt; watch.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Mostly, she hurts herself or threatens to when she<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t get her way. <br/>\n&gt;  An example would be if I don&#39;t do what she asked at<br/>\n&gt; just that moment, <br/>\n&gt; she threatens to hurt herself.  If I get after her<br/>\n&gt; for doing something <br/>\n&gt; inapproriate to one of her sisters, she may threaten<br/>\n&gt; to kill herself. <br/>\n&gt;  In reading that, you may think she&#39;s just spoiled. <br/>\n&gt; The worry then is <br/>\n&gt; sometimes she actually will hurt herself.  Then<br/>\n&gt; older she gets, there <br/>\n&gt; are more ways she can hurt herself.  I can&#39;t always<br/>\n&gt; do as she demands. <br/>\n&gt;  I can&#39;t punish her for hurting herself.  I haven&#39;e<br/>\n&gt; been able to stop <br/>\n&gt; her from hurting herself.  I have thought long and<br/>\n&gt; hard about what to do <br/>\n&gt; to help her learn to deal with impatience, anger,<br/>\n&gt; and frustration.  It <br/>\n&gt; could be just a stage she&#39;s going through at 3 1/2. <br/>\n&gt; What really bothers <br/>\n&gt; me is that she&#39;s been hurting herself since about 18<br/>\n&gt; months.  It <br/>\n&gt; definitely wasn&#39;t from watching movies and tv then.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So I&#39;ve began a new strategy.  It&#39;s rather extreme<br/>\n&gt; and I really don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; know if it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but she<br/>\n&gt; hasn&#39;t hurt herself in <br/>\n&gt; over two weeks.  It began like this:  After one<br/>\n&gt; episode where she was <br/>\n&gt; yanking her hair and threatening to run out in the<br/>\n&gt; street to get hit by <br/>\n&gt; a car, I say her on my lap and said that I loved<br/>\n&gt; her.  That every time <br/>\n&gt; she got hurt, it hurt me because I love her so much.<br/>\n&gt;  I told her that I <br/>\n&gt; gave birth to her out of my tummy because I wanted<br/>\n&gt; her to be alive and <br/>\n&gt; to be happy.  Then I told her that because she<br/>\n&gt; couldn&#39;t see how much it <br/>\n&gt; hurt me when she hurt herself, I would show her. <br/>\n&gt; From then on, whenever <br/>\n&gt; she hurt herself, I would do the same thing to<br/>\n&gt; myself.  And I have.  The <br/>\n&gt; last time she&#39;s hurt herself was at this computer. <br/>\n&gt; She was upset <br/>\n&gt; because the game she was playing was too hard so she<br/>\n&gt; began to slam her <br/>\n&gt; knee on the edge of the desk.  So I did the same.  I<br/>\n&gt; ended up cutting my <br/>\n&gt; knee in two places and making a huge bruise.  I know<br/>\n&gt; this sounds awful <br/>\n&gt; and very dramatic and I guess it is.  But it made a<br/>\n&gt; huge impression on <br/>\n&gt; her.  She was very upset to see her mommy hurt.  I<br/>\n&gt; told her that&#39;s how <br/>\n&gt; upset I feel when she hurts herself.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have no idea if this is the right thing to do. <br/>\n&gt; But it&#39;s all I could <br/>\n&gt; think of.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Thank you for your insights.  Heidi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n </span></blockquote>__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo!

I would like<br/>\nto add a few clarifying thoughts of my own.<br/>\n<br/>\n...on choice,  below you responded to my point about<br/>\nreaction versus choice... <br/>\n<br/>\n...I don&#39;t think anyone ever chooses &quot;the exact<br/>\nopposite&quot; in all things........But with unschooling<br/>\nit&#39;s neither of those things.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI never meant to imply that someone would choose the<br/>\nopposite in all things, however in individual things<br/>\nlike how we discipline, how we nurture, how we set<br/>\nboundaries, etc... the choice itself may either be a<br/>\nconscious choice or a reaction depending on how much<br/>\nwe have resolved any issues, should there be any that<br/>\nwould influence a reaction versus a true choice.  To<br/>\njust outright say that with unschooling this is not<br/>\nthe case, in my opinion is a generalization that does<br/>\nnot take into account the personal experience of the<br/>\nindividual in the given situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain to my point about inadequate boundaries where i<br/>\nwrite:<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not knowing<br/>\nwhat is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the<br/>\nparent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYou responded by saying,<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;That&#39;s not an issue with attachment parenting.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, on one level I agree with you, true AP honors<br/>\nthe full needs of the child including the needed<br/>\nboundaries etc..., however, given that we are all<br/>\nhuman, we bring into our parenting experiences both<br/>\nthe healthy and unhealthy influences from our past. <br/>\nAt times these influences negatively effect our<br/>\nability to set healthy boundaries even when in theory<br/>\nwe are APing.  I have witnessed many AP parents<br/>\nstruggle with their own childhood issues and therefore<br/>\nat times be unable to identify the true needs of their<br/>\nchild.  Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>\nexperience. We are not Gods, we make mistakes, we<br/>\nlearn.  The decision to practice AP while a huge step<br/>\nin the right direction, does not excempt us from these<br/>\nlessons, or from the influences of our past.  Only our<br/>\npersonal committment to seperating out our own issues<br/>\nfrom those of our child will allow our children to<br/>\nunfold naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n__________________________________<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.
