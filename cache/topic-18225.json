Here&#39;s something from a friend of mine in Sweden.  It&#39;s a link to a <br/>\nsite answering a question about the plural of &quot;penis.&quot;   Besides being very <br/>\nfunny, it&#39;s got useful, good stuff.  A couple of quotes, and the URL below:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Penis is a third declension noun, not second declension. These nouns often <br/>\nend in -is in the singular and -es in the plural. The English style -ises is <br/>\nsometimes preferred. Hence, we have penises (half of us do, anyway), and <br/>\nmantises and pelvises, but only more rarely do you see penes, mantes, and pelves, <br/>\nthough they are not incorrect. In many cases, only the Latin form is <br/>\nacceptable: We have testes (some more than others) and crises and psychoses, but never <br/>\ntestises, crisises, or pyschosises. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Some English -us nouns were borrowed from other parts of speech in Latin <br/>\nor from other forms (cases) of the noun than the usual nominative. Most of us <br/>\ndon&#39;t get boni or ride bi (but I&#39;m not judgmental if you do). We get bonuses <br/>\nand ride buses.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mplurals.html\">http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mplurals.html</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18224,"nextTopicId":18231}}
