I am finding the more I have read about the philosophy behind unschooling, that my husband and I have been pretty uptight parents.  I have tried to follow the read, watch, wait rule here, and have read a lot on this board and subject since last summer.  I see ways in which our children act out in response.  Nothing major, but they are pretty little still at 8,7, and 5.  I really don&#39;t want to continue on this road of arbitrary rules, and kids fighting against them.  I don&#39;t think the kid&#39;s response is wrong.  It is good they are fighting against some of what we have thrown their way.  If we make a big change in terms of rules and such, I know they will go whole hog, because of the ways they have been restricted.  Is there a way to minimize that, or should I even try?  Will it even out eventually?  I am nervous, but I do know we are not setting them up for success in life the way we are doing things now.  I think my husband will be on board for a big change, but I do know we are both going to bristle when things that were rules before, are &quot;broken&quot;.  I guess that is our problem :)  I guess my big question, is there still hope? (I think there is).  Just feeling intimidated by the enormity of completely changing our ways around here.  Any advice will be much appreciated.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60987,"nextTopicId":61047}}
