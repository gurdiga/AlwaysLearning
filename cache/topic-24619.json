In a half hour, i  <br/>\ncan usually do breakfast dishes, lunch dishes and chop up some stuff  <br/>\nfor dinner.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you can take two hours on a weekend or something, you can  <br/>\nprepare a lot of meat or veggies or both (if you&#39;re an omnivore like  <br/>\nus!) put it in ziplock baggies with dates on it. That way you have it  <br/>\nprepared to just throw in. I can cook five pounds of scrambled beef,  <br/>\ntwo pounds of chicken breasts and a roast, and chop it up, divide it  <br/>\ninto 1lb bags and have all the food we&#39;d possibly want for a week.  <br/>\nSame for veggies, chop up a few onions, peppers, and just have it  <br/>\ndivided into the snack size ziplocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Nancy said, prepare for leftovers! We like to have &#39;redo&#39;  <br/>\nnights. So if we have spaghetti on Monday, we&#39;ll use the leftover  <br/>\nsauce to make pizza on Tuesday, maybe some baked rigatoni. Whatever.  <br/>\nTaco meat can turn into shepard&#39;s pie or mexican cassarole.<br/>\nMelissa<br/>\nMom to Josh (11), Breanna (8), Emily (7), Rachel (6), Sam (4), Dan  <br/>\n(2), and Avari Rose</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":7527178,"authorName":"CelticFrau@aol.com","from":"CelticFrau@...","profile":"celticfrau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Discord: It&#39;s what&#39;s for dinner tonight -- question for ...","postDate":"1141016830","msgId":24619,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE5MC41MWViODIzYS4zMTMzZTJmZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":24620,"prevInTime":24618,"nextInTime":24620,"topicId":24619,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"3rd vote here for Crockpots!
