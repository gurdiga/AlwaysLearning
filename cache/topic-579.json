She has a good <br/>\n&gt; friend who is doing accelerated work in many areas and has already taken a <br/>\n&gt; bunch of tests. I am totally uninterested in her taking any sort of test <br/>\n&gt; ever. But if she really wants to? And if I know she&#39;s thinking about it, is <br/>\n&gt; it wise to give her the info about these tests?  We&#39;ve talked about it some <br/>\n&gt; - <br/>\n&gt; I stress how the tests are limited sources of information. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I want to do what she wants, but I fear that having a numerical score will <br/>\n&gt; leave an indelible &quot;feeling&quot; in her about her intelligence.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When opportunities for classes, etc. come up, I will give Julian the <br/>\ninformation and he will let me know whether he wants to do it or not.  I <br/>\nfigure if it&#39;s in the world and he is interested, he deserves to know about <br/>\nit. When we get newsletters, etc., from homeschool groups, we just go over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTests are tricky. I think they&#39;re stupid, but Julian (also 12) expressed <br/>\ninterest in taking an IQ test. I asked if it needed to be &quot;official&quot; and <br/>\nformal, or if it could be online or through a book. He said casual was fine, <br/>\nand I ran across something online.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, he took it and scored very high (despite taking a snack break in the <br/>\nmiddle of the timed test.).

He had some <br/>\nself-esteem issues because of a couple of friends, and ultimately taking that <br/>\nlittle test has been good for him. In the last few months I&#39;ve noticed him <br/>\nchallenging himself more. He&#39;s been writing fairly regularly, and has asked <br/>\nBeth to teach him math. (I&#39;ll go into that in another post.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI would never push a test on a kid, but since she&#39;s asked, I&#39;d give her the <br/>\ninformation and let her decide. You can remind her that results on tests are <br/>\naffected by lots of things, and not to stress it too much. You might also ask <br/>\nher WHY she wants to take a test. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":573,"nextTopicId":345}}
