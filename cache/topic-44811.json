Lizzy and I have had some conversations about how some kids might develop a problem with pot or alcohol because getting high feels so much better than how they usually feel they think they need it.   I asked her to imagine if she hadn&#39;t learned to be ok and cope with feeling anxious and then got high that she might feel that she  needed to get high every time she was anxious.  For her refering to it as self medicating means she is in control of using it not that it controls how she feels.  <br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: a question","postDate":"1242233556","msgId":45020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRBMEFGQUQ0LjkwMzA0MDNAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGd1ZXRhMCs2cmZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGd1ZXRhMCs2cmZ2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":45019,"nextInTopic":45023,"prevInTime":45019,"nextInTime":45021,"topicId":44811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

During my experience teaching in both the public and private sector, and as a parent of children who previously attended private school, I learned that labels are primarily used for any child who does not fit in the system.  Typically, there is nothing wrong with the child.  The problem is the environment.  Rather than change the environment to suit the child, they try to change the child to suit the environment - sometimes by drugging the child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----- i was also wondering if there are any cases of ADHD among unschoohlers?-----<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have any children with the ADHD label, but I do have a son who has an Asperger&#39;s label.  That label was very pertinent when he was still in school.  It helped explain why he didn&#39;t behave the way the other children did - like the time he ran out of the classroom and climed on top of the school secretary&#39;s desk when the teaching assitant changed mid-year.  However, I discovered that the label sort of faded away once we started unschooling.  He has a lot more control over his environment now, and now people just see him as an introverted child who likes things to be a particular way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine a label of ADHD would also fade away once a child no longer has to sit still and listen to a boring teacher.  Behavioral labels are about kids not fitting into the environment.  If you change the environment, the label will no longer apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227835915,"authorName":"m_aduhene","from":"&quot;m_aduhene&quot; &lt;m_aduhene@...&gt;","profile":"m_aduhene","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"a question","postDate":"1241915465","msgId":44811,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1NTc4OSs2MDBpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":44824,"prevInTime":44810,"nextInTime":44812,"topicId":44811,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hi i am not sure if this is strictly and unschooling question, but it would  be good if i could ask it.  what are people s opinions on ADHD?  we have a young","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-528260841\">hi<br/>\ni am not sure if this is strictly and unschooling question, but it would  be good if i could ask it.  what are people&#39;s opinions on ADHD?  we have a young man who stays with us occasionally.  he is 16 and was &quot;diagnosed&quot; about a year ago.  i asked him if he felt he was &quot;ill&quot; and he said he had read a book (on ADHD) which described him exactly.  i had read some research that suggested ADHD is not technically a medical condition and is used as an excuse to quieten down children who do not fit the system.  i was also wondering if there are any cases of ADHD among unschoohlers?<br/>\napologies if this is off-topic.<br/>\nblessings<br/>\nmichelle</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45198,"nextTopicId":45220}}
