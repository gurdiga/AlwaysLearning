It&#39;s <br/>\nMe, Margaret, by Judy Blume.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly wanted to read it, so I took her and bought a copy just a bit ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe sat down to read.  She&#39;s not so fluent at this kind of text yet, but she <br/>\nwants to try to pass her friend.  (Healthy competition?  Maybe or maybe not, <br/>\nbut I didn&#39;t discuss that with her.  I did warn her that some people don&#39;t <br/>\ndiscuss books just the way you&#39;d like them, that while one is talking about <br/>\nwhat a character might have been thinking and why they did things, the other <br/>\nmight just be saying &quot;Isn&#39;t it interesting that her sister&#39;s name was <br/>\n&#39;Boobsie&#39;?&quot;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing she asked me from the other room was, &quot;What is s-o-c-i-a-l ?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI said the word.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny!<br/>\n<br/>\nShe knows &quot;sociable,&quot; but didn&#39;t know &quot;social,&quot; so it&#39;s not too weird.  But <br/>\nthe difference between her social life and her...   there is no difference.  <br/>\nHer whole LIFE is social!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14162,"nextTopicId":14136}}
