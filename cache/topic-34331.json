My oldest daughter&#39;s best friend from a long time ago did<br/>\nexactly that at the age of 4.  Her mom was really surprised and when she<br/>\nended up in school she was put in all the advanced classes because she<br/>\nknew how to read.  Learning how to read is just one of many skills that<br/>\na kid learns in their lifetime.  It&#39;s an important one for sure, but not<br/>\nthe be all end all of skills.  My daughter didn&#39;t start reading until<br/>\nabout 11 or 12, and at 14 reads book after book, can&#39;t get enough of it.<br/>\nHer friend that learned how to read at 4, rarely picks up a book for<br/>\npleasure and her skill set has leveled out to match all the other kids<br/>\nin school.  She&#39;s smart for sure, but it has more to do with her<br/>\npersonality rather than anything she was taught.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of my girls at various times have asked me to teach them how to<br/>\nread.  We&#39;ve used various things over the years, but ultimately what was<br/>\nbest was video and computer games, combined with lots of books on<br/>\ntape/cd, and me reading to them.  My youngest is 6 and doesn&#39;t read yet,<br/>\nbut can read some words.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will know when they can read, because they will be reading.  Picking<br/>\nup books to look at when they are young is part of that process of<br/>\nlearning about those mysterious symbols.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes she<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; place 2 stuffed animals next to 2 more stuffed animals and count out<br/>\n&gt; that there are 4 of them?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Again it depends on the child.  My oldest daughter learned math<br/>\ncomputive skills with money.  Anything beyond money, she&#39;s not<br/>\ninterested in, it&#39;s not really her thing, her mind works in other<br/>\ndirections.  She can figure out those hand manipulative type puzzles at<br/>\nscience museums really well, even the spacial ones, she can visualize<br/>\nsomething in her head and create things like clothing and acessories,<br/>\nbut if you ask her what 25 plus 37 is, she will have no idea or interest<br/>\nin figuring that out, unless of course it is money.  My younger daughter<br/>\ndoes multiplication in her head.  She&#39;s always got numbers floating<br/>\naround in there.  She can count to ten in 3 languages and does simple<br/>\naddition in those languages.  I don&#39;t know why she does it, she must<br/>\nfind it fun and fascinating.  She adds and subtracts and multiplies and<br/>\ndivides in her head, she has a unique concept of abstracts like<br/>\ninfinity.  I didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; her those things, and she didn&#39;t count<br/>\nstuffed animals either.  It started with fingers and toes and other<br/>\npeople&#39;s fingers and toes.

There&#39;s absolutely no difference between how she&#39;s  <br/>\nlearning English and how she&#39;ll learn to read, write and manipulate  <br/>\nnumbers. She will come up with new strategies, she&#39;ll have more  <br/>\nsophisticated needs, but the process of trying things out to see how  <br/>\nthey work and playing around with things will still be the foundation.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo difference.

Each child is different. They absorb signs (STOP,  <br/>\nMcDonalds ...), they hear stories, they play with words, they write  <br/>\n(for some kids before they read), they ask questions, they watch as  <br/>\nyou read .... It&#39;s a huge conglomeration of experiences, none of  <br/>\nwhich by itself is important, but the whole chaotic mess and -- even  <br/>\nmore important! -- the process of them making sense of the chaos, is  <br/>\nwhat allows them to figure out how it works.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Does she<br/>\n&gt; place 2 stuffed animals next to 2 more stuffed animals and count out<br/>\n&gt; that there are 4 of them?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Probably she&#39;ll do some of that but, unlike school, the answer to a  <br/>\nproblem in isolation isn&#39;t the gaol. The purpose of real math is  <br/>\ncomparing things and finding patterns. The fact that 2+2=4 isn&#39;t that  <br/>\nmeaningful or interesting.

I am new <br/>\n  to the idea of homeschooling. My daughter (Lexi) is almost 2 1/2 <br/>\n  and shortly after she was born I realized that I felt strongly about <br/>\n  homeschooling her ... but lacked the confidence that it was <br/>\n  something I could do. Since that time I have been involved a great <br/>\n  deal with a wonderful API group with quite a few homeschoolers and <br/>\n  learned a lot. The group I previously belonged to (before moving to <br/>\n  Florida) was made up more of Waldorf homeschoolers. So, much of my <br/>\n  limited knowledge of homeschooling has come from that theory. I am <br/>\n  now in a group that seems more drawn to Unschooling and am taking <br/>\n  this opportunity to learn more. I had read about Unschooling <br/>\n  briefly in the past and was very intrigued, thinking ... well, <br/>\n  that&#39;s how we&#39;ve lived our life so far with Lexi and it seems so <br/>\n  very natural! Why does it feel so natural to live our life this way <br/>\n  and then so intimidating and pressured that I should change to <br/>\n  another approach when she turns 6 or 7 because all of a sudden I am <br/>\n  supposed to start teaching her something, reporting outcomes, <br/>\n  testing, evaluating, channelling, structuring ...??????? I guess <br/>\n  where I am struggling is ... I LOVE what I&#39;ve learned so far about <br/>\n  Unschooling!!! ... it is how Lexi has lived her life since she was <br/>\n  born ... nursing whenever she feels like it, playing when she wants <br/>\n  to, sleeping when she wants to ... even though daddy and I &quot;play <br/>\n  dead&quot; when she is doing cartwheels in the bed at 11PM so she will <br/>\n  finally get bored and hopefully go to sleep ;-) ... eating what she <br/>\n  wants when she wants (our house is filled with good food so I never <br/>\n  worry about what she will choose) ... etc. The struggle is ... <br/>\n  what do I do when she &quot;needs&quot; to start learning to read, write, <br/>\n  learn mathematics, etc.? I realize that my years of schooling (20+) <br/>\n  to get to the point of receiving my doctoral degree have led me to <br/>\n  be an OVERLY organized person, somewhat ANAL ... which I am doing a <br/>\n  great job of reversing ;-), a PERFECTIONIST ... which my daughter is <br/>\n  doing a great job assisting me in relaxing with ;-), SCHEDULE driven <br/>\n  person ... which has totally been thrown by the wayside since <br/>\n  becoming a full-time mommy ... boy, I&#39;m loving this ... But, when <br/>\n  it comes to education, that is all I know. How does the transition <br/>\n  come about when the child starts learning in a more academic <br/>\n  manner ... asks to start learning to read? ... does she just pick <br/>\n  up a wonderful book that I&#39;ve been reading to her and read it <br/>\n  herself? ... she already seems to be trying this out. Does she <br/>\n  place 2 stuffed animals next to 2 more stuffed animals and count out <br/>\n  that there are 4 of them? I know this may sound naive and I hope I <br/>\n  am not frustrating those of you who are more advanced and wise in <br/>\n  this area. I guess I am just trying to get a feel for where to <br/>\n  start (actually where to NOT start if I am following her lead ;-)). <br/>\n  I have do doubt that she is learning every day and I have no <br/>\n  difficulty what-so-ever in being able to observe clearly what she is <br/>\n  learning.

Why does it feel so natural to live our life this way <br/>\nand then so intimidating and pressured that I should change to <br/>\nanother approach when she turns 6 or 7 because all of a sudden I am <br/>\nsupposed to start teaching her something, reporting outcomes, <br/>\ntesting, evaluating, channelling, structuring ...???????  I guess <br/>\nwhere I am struggling is ... I LOVE what I&#39;ve learned so far about <br/>\nUnschooling!!! ... it is how Lexi has lived her life since she was <br/>\nborn ... nursing whenever she feels like it, playing when she wants <br/>\nto, sleeping when she wants to ... even though daddy and I &quot;play <br/>\ndead&quot; when she is doing cartwheels in the bed at 11PM so she will <br/>\nfinally get bored and hopefully go to sleep ;-) ... eating what she <br/>\nwants when she wants (our house is filled with good food so I never <br/>\nworry about what she will choose) ... etc.   The struggle is ... <br/>\nwhat do I do when she &quot;needs&quot; to start learning to read, write, <br/>\nlearn mathematics, etc.?  I realize that my years of schooling (20+) <br/>\nto get to the point of receiving my doctoral degree have led me to <br/>\nbe an OVERLY organized person, somewhat ANAL ... which I am doing a <br/>\ngreat job of reversing ;-), a PERFECTIONIST ... which my daughter is <br/>\ndoing a great job assisting me in relaxing with ;-), SCHEDULE driven <br/>\nperson ... which has totally been thrown by the wayside since <br/>\nbecoming a full-time mommy ... boy, I&#39;m loving this ...  But, when <br/>\nit comes to education, that is all I know.  How does the transition <br/>\ncome about when the child starts learning in a more academic <br/>\nmanner ... asks to start learning to read?  ... does she just pick <br/>\nup a wonderful book that I&#39;ve been reading to her and read it <br/>\nherself?  ... she already seems to be trying this out.  Does she <br/>\nplace 2 stuffed animals next to 2 more stuffed animals and count out <br/>\nthat there are 4 of them?  I know this may sound naive and I hope I <br/>\nam not frustrating those of you who are more advanced and wise in <br/>\nthis area.  I guess I am just trying to get a feel for where to <br/>\nstart (actually where to NOT start if I am following her lead ;-)).  <br/>\nI have do doubt that she is learning every day and I have no <br/>\ndifficulty what-so-ever in being able to observe clearly what she is <br/>\nlearning.  I am just wondering how I go about creating the best <br/>\nenvironment to facilitate this beyond toddlerhood ... preschool ... <br/>\ninto more of a school-age level?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much for all your wisdom on this subject!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of Health,<br/>\nNatalie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34302,"nextTopicId":34340}}
