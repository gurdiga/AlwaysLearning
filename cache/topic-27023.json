I<br/>\nfound your own varied experiences really helpful. Sandra<br/>\nyou&#39;re bang on the nail that I hoped my son would respond in French.<br/>\nThe decision I&#39;ve come to for the moment - and it&#39;s flexible - is to<br/>\ncontinue speaking French, to my son, and as often as possible, to my<br/>\nhusband, whose French is high-intermediate. When it gets difficult, we<br/>\nshift to English. I abandon all hope that he speaks back in French and<br/>\nthis exchange with you all has made me more respectful of his<br/>\npreference whereas before I felt irritated and scornful every time he<br/>\nspoke English. But it&#39;s not ideal. I think monolinguism is ideal! As<br/>\nsomeone said, people who just speak one language may well speak it<br/>\nbetter. I myself find that as my French gets more fluent my English<br/>\ngets corrupted and vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a baby girl so it&#39;s been hard to make time - usually my husband<br/>\ntakes over looking after my son, which is why English has suddenly<br/>\nbecome dominant. That&#39;s been a bit of a shock to me. My son also<br/>\nsounds absolutely gorgeous when he speaks French. He uses a different,<br/>\nmore natural voice, perhaps because that&#39;s his mother tongue. I also<br/>\nthink French enables both of us to express<br/>\nbetter emotions. I&#39;ve noticed that when he does something annoying<br/>\nand I respond indignantly in French, he responds better. It&#39;s like a<br/>\nway through. I think when I speak in English, I can get cross more<br/>\neasily and I don&#39;t know why. I get cross in French too but I can bend<br/>\nthe crossness and make it more indignant, less hostile.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am making extra time to read him stories in French - I have<br/>\na few story books he&#39;s keen on. While I read them he does a strange<br/>\nbabble, neither French nor English. So no, he&#39;s not particularly<br/>\nagainst French, he just finds it increasingly difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I&#39;d be interested to do a weekend visit. I have family in France<br/>\nbut spend more time trying to avoid them than anything else.<br/>\nThanks again for the help, which has been good guidance.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27017,"nextTopicId":27027}}
