I am aware that I get somewhat irked when I&#39;m overwhelmed with cleaning <br/>\nup vomit and dd asks for someone to go get a crayon for her - MY own baggage, <br/>\nI know but I don&#39;t handle it well necessarily - is that more than you needed <br/>\nto know?!)  ANYWAY,  imo, ASK....always ASK.....express your needs, sorrows, <br/>\nideas and trust that they will be answered in SOME way.....<br/>\n<br/>\nperhaps the &#39;answer&#39; will be that you feel energized and overlook the clutter <br/>\nfor a time....perhaps dd will go to bed early one evening which allows you to <br/>\n&#39;catch up&#39;....perhaps dh will make arrangements with the kids for a <br/>\nday.....perhaps dd will get up early one day and then have that missing <br/>\nnap....perhaps it is a time of quiet that you need but since that doesn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel &#39;responsible&#39; you say that it is the clutter that needs to be taken care <br/>\nof (I once had dh take the kids out for the day and I sat on our swing <br/>\nreading a book and fell asleep - I surely missed the boat on what I neede <br/>\nwhen I planned that day of cleaning! - I tolerated the house and everything <br/>\nso much &#39;better&#39; after being refreshed emotionally, physically, spiritually) <br/>\n....perhaps you are presenting dh with an opportunity to support you and be <br/>\nwith his kids....perhaps a &#39;family cleaning time&#39; would be fun.....perhaps dh <br/>\nand ds would surprise you with a clean house after sending you away to a spa <br/>\nfor the day....(ooh!  I like that one!!).......perhaps perhaps perhaps  etc <br/>\netc etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nmy point is, don&#39;t have any ONE answer in mind - that can be disappointing <br/>\nand frustrating....esp. if the answer you want is for someone else to do <br/>\nsomething....however, DO propose your idea.....and see how it all comes <br/>\ntogether....could be quite magical!<br/>\n<br/>\nand re: dd&#39;s crayon request....I thank her for the opportunity to go to the <br/>\nedge (or beyond!) of my patience and trust that I can handle that edge more <br/>\nlovingly next time....<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of that will be helpful!  <br/>\nJane<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4055,"nextTopicId":4079}}
