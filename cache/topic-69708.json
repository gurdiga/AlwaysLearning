Just doing a quick search, I see some states only specify a certain number of years of mathematics instruction, not which courses. Some don&#39;t require more than first year algebra to graduate - including some which require math instruction all four years of high school! And of those which do require more, it&#39;s not *much* more - a second year of algebra and/or geometry.

We have been unschooling since the oldest were 9, 7 and 5. My 13, actually almost 14 yr old, wants to play high school football. He is wanting to try highschool because he thinks the football team will make fun of him for not going to the school and being homeschooled. He is also VERY social and I think he is looking forward to that part of school. My suspicion is that he will not like all the academic demands and will end up quitting but who knows?? My question or dilemma is his lack of math experience. He has had no interest in doing any formal kind of math. I&#39;m sure he has been learning mathematical concepts along the way but he would be lost in a 9th grade math class for sure. He is saying he wants to catch up and be ready to go next August. How do I go about this? I was thinking a math tutor? He really doesn&#39;t like me &quot;teaching&quot; him. What does he need to learn in order to succeed? I doubt he has to go back and learn everything...for example probably doesn&#39;t need long division? I think as long as he knows WHEN to divide and can work a calculater that should be fine? I just don&#39;t know exactly where to start in order to have him ready for high school or somewhat ready anyway. Any thoughts or advice will be greatly appreciated. I think due to his motivation to play football he will learn quickly.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you,<br/>\n<br/>\nSuzette Dufresne<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n     <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   \t\t \t   \t\t  <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":199413368,"authorName":"suzette","from":"&quot;suzette&quot; &lt;bizeeemom@...&gt;","profile":"bizeeemom","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Wants to learn math now...","postDate":"1354403244","msgId":69708,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGs5ZTJqYytycGYyQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":69709,"prevInTime":69707,"nextInTime":69709,"topicId":69708,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sandra, Pam and whoever else, My name is Suzette and I have 4 kids ages 15, 13, 11 and 6.
