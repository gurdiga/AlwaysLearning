The difference for us, is that she is unschooling.  What she is into IS hair and make-up, this is part and parcel of how we help her learn more about that industry.  She has tried many many products, some very expensive ones.  I&#39;ve gotta say that most of the expensive ones perform better.  There is a reason why they cost more.  That&#39;s not the case for all top brands though.  We also know that Sally&#39;s Beauty Supply, if you have one any where nearby, sells much less expensive items that perform the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe buy replaceable razor heads for 2 different razors depending on where we happen to be shopping.  Chamille actually prefers the cheaper one because she likes the moisture strip on that one better than the other one.  She&#39;s also tried lots of different shaving creams and lotions, and hair conditioners (what I got to use as a teen), and decided that the aveeno bar soap is by far the best product for shaving and not making her skin dry out.  It took trial and error to find that out, and yes, money spent on trying out different products.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help to know what it is she wants from a particular product.  I personally don&#39;t like Suave and neither does Chamille, it&#39;s way too drying and makes hair kind of frizzy which needs to be countered with more products that cost more money.  After trying many many many products, she found, out of the lower end products, that the Garnier products worked pretty good.  They don&#39;t cost much more than Suave.  Again though, it was through much trial and error and money spent of trying out various products.  Chamille loves the Bed Head products and the Catwalk products, but they are very expensive and we only buy them occasionally and she uses them sparingly.  We tend to use the higher end products for finishing details, like the serums for using flat irons or anti-frizz control.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that I&#39;d go either/or on the personal hygiene products!  I&#39;m kind of picky myself.  It is the ONE thing that I spend money on when I don&#39;t have much.  I will go without rather than buy a product that I don&#39;t like.  That&#39;s just me.  I&#39;m a sucker for really nice soaps, and nice smelling hair products and nice lotions.  I splurge and use sparingly.  I have a couple of low end items that I&#39;ll buy in a pinch, I&#39;ve been using them a lot lately so that Chamille can afford her higher end products.  Trader Joe&#39;s is wonderful for that!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it were me, I&#39;d offer to try a variety of low end products to see which one she likes the best and maybe splurge every now and again on a nice finishing product.  Suave may be the least expensive, but even if you can add a dollar to that amount, you&#39;ll expand your options greatly!  Perhaps just a few more choices would help her feel less like needing the most expensive.  After all, hair care products, in most stores will take up an entire aisle!  That&#39;s a lot of choices, even if only half the aisle would fit in the budget. <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240838916,"authorName":"Deborah McKee Kelly","from":"Deborah McKee Kelly &lt;dlmckee@...&gt;","profile":"hael_harobed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling and earning money","postDate":"1268678258","msgId":52089,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4NjBiMzFlMTAwMzE1MTEzN3E1NzM5YjE5ZW03NzcxOGIxMGUyYjAwMTYzQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc4NjBiMzFlMTAwMzE1MTA0MHM2ZjhlOTRiZGthMjg4YWFjMTM0ZTNiOTMwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhua2M5YitvYTl1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPgkgPDg3MUE4M0FDLTgzRjYtNDE1Mi1CNTQ0LTQ0RThENjgxODYyNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JIDw0QjlFNThFMS42MDIwNTA0QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+CSA8QUEwRDEzNjMtRTY1NS00RDFGLUIyMDUtNDlGNTZGODI4NzE0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPgkgPDc4NjBiMzFlMTAwMzE1MTA0MHM2ZjhlOTRiZGthMjg4YWFjMTM0ZTNiOTMwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":52088,"nextInTopic":52091,"prevInTime":52088,"nextInTime":52090,"topicId":52031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And just so we re clear on the shampoo/cosmetics thing -- I am ALWAYS willing to buy her shampoo (and feminine products and toothpaste and band-aids, etc.).

I don&#39;t want it to sound like either she buys it or she<br/>\nhas NO shampoo.  I&#39;m not that mean!  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am willing / I can afford to spend about $3 a month on a bottle of Suave<br/>\nor equivalent &quot;cheap-o&quot; shampoo.  I will happily buy a bottle of that for<br/>\nher every month or so and it can be hers, and she can choose the<br/>\nflavor/scent/whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I balk is at her stated &quot;need&quot; to have a salon-quality, $10-or-more<br/>\nbottle of shampoo that no one else is allowed to touch because her hair is<br/>\nmore important than anyone else&#39;s and because Aunt So-and-So, who went to<br/>\nbeauty school and KNOWS, told her she has to wash her hair twice daily to<br/>\nnot only get the dirt out but also to get it &quot;really clean,&quot;<br/>\nand...and...and...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s where I don&#39;t want to be judgmental or preachy -- I don&#39;t even want<br/>\nto get into a conversation about what is &quot;better&quot; for hair -- what the heck<br/>\ndo I know?   I just want her to see that in our family budget, a $3 bottle<br/>\nis provided for her no strings attached, and that if she wants the &quot;better&quot;<br/>\nstuff, I&#39;d like her to pitch in her money for the difference.  She&#39;s a smart<br/>\ngirl who can balance those kind of choices, and if she wants to use her<br/>\nmoney that way, instead of for something else, I want her to have that<br/>\nchoice.  And maybe she&#39;ll always feel that way about shampoo and hair, and<br/>\nthat is just fine by me.  I have grown women friends who I wouldn&#39;t think of<br/>\nadvising on their hair-care choices.  But to do that, to have that choice,<br/>\nshe&#39;s got to have *her* money, and it&#39;s got to be an agreement that we&#39;ve<br/>\ndiscussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my little world of values, my extra $7 saved on shampoo will be going for<br/>\na chunk of salmon or a book or a pair of socks -- something like that --<br/>\nwhich I don&#39;t really expect her to appreciate.  And that&#39;s okay.  We are<br/>\ndifferent people with different interests, and it&#39;s fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s another quick example of not foisting my values on her:  I personally<br/>\ndo not use razors, because I don&#39;t shave anything on my body.  HOWEVER,<br/>\nshaving is important to her.  I&#39;m not getting into any kind of value or<br/>\njudgment conversation with her about what is &quot;right,&quot; or &quot;better,&quot; because<br/>\nshe is fully capable of making those decisions herself, and I seriously<br/>\ndon&#39;t care what other women do or don&#39;t do with their body hair.  Because<br/>\nshaving is important to her, I am more than willing to buy her shaving<br/>\nsupplies -- razors, shaving cream, whatever.  Where we hit the problem<br/>\nagain, however, is where I am only willing / able to spend $xx on a basic<br/>\nrazor and some off-brand, cheap-o shaving cream.  She wants the<br/>\ntop-of-the-line most recent Venus whatever that all her friends are using<br/>\nand that she saw in a magazine and she MUST have the silky smooth shaving<br/>\ngel brand-name blah blah because it&#39;s &quot;better.&quot;  If she had some skin<br/>\nproblem or reaction to the cheaper ones, that would be something we&#39;d take<br/>\ninto account.  But just like the shampoo, is it so bad for me to say, &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>\ngladly provide this razor and shaving cream for you, but if you want the<br/>\nhigher-end kind, I&#39;ll put the amount I can pay toward it, and you can take<br/>\ncare of the difference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like input for this, because it&#39;s somewhat the same idea I&#39;d like to<br/>\nuse with my younger kids as they get older.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.

We seeded the first transaction with a year&#39;s worth of allowance to compensate for our earlier failure, and to give our then-10yo a meaningful amount of money to work with ($520).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; Since then, we&#39;ve tried several other things, mostly without a lot of success.  There was the &quot;working for the family&quot; thing -- if each kid put in 7 hours of farm labor each week, then after the first 7 hours, they could start earning money at an agreed-upon rate.  That got fairly ugly, too, which is a lot of the reason Caitlin has no interest in working for her dad.  And I don&#39;t blame her.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re wrong to do this.<br/>\nIf this is work that you&#39;d pay an outside laborer to do, then it&#39;s work you don&#39;t demand the first day&#39;s worth of work be done, unpaid.  (Or, at least, I hope you&#39;re not, since in that context it&#39;s criminal -- with your children it&#39;s still as morally bad . . . just not illegal).<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; I suggested to my hubby at one point that we give Caitlin (actually all the kids) a flat amount at the beginning of each month -- someone in one of those older threads suggested that -- and that she have the ability to use it as she wished.  We&#39;d pay for her dance lessons, her school lunches, her textbook fees, and an agreed-upon amount for clothing and &quot;necessities&quot; like toiletries, etc.  Then her monthly amount (her allowance), not tied to any chores or work or anything, could be used as she wished for her stuff, no strings attached. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m suggesting something more comprehensive, that gives her a better and bigger opportunity to make decisions, budget, and understand money.  I&#39;d figure out the bigger picture (including the dance lessons, lunches, textbooks, clothing and toiletries) and let her cut the checks to the studio, make decisions about shampoo, and figure out how to save and budget for the horse lessons, competitions, etc. within a budget that suits your family.  She might find she wants to forego new pants and instead enter a competition.  She might decide to cut back dance and take horse riding . . . but she&#39;d have the flexibility to make those decisions, and the responsibility for a much greater, meaningful, sum of money.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur now 14yo has, over the last four years, purchased a Nintendo DS, an MP3 player, an iPod, all the gifts she&#39;s given her friends (which we had been paying for, but she decided to take over at 11, as she felt they weren&#39;t really &quot;from her&quot; if we paid for them), lots of different kinds of clothes, hugely expensive makeup (which, frankly, I&#39;d prefer she use the higher end stuff), a number of charitable contributions, and an assortment of other things.  She&#39;s able to do this because she&#39;s in charge of a meaningful amount of money.  If we were pressed into a narrower budget, we would do what I&#39;ve suggested you try -- give the line item budget of her expenses over to her to make the choices within that budget.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d continue to drive her to the places she chose to use the monies, and I&#39;d continue to help her plan (she asked me to be her nag when she was saving for the iPod -- my job was to say, &quot;Are you sure [you want to buy that small item]? What about the iPod?&quot;  (That was, verbatim, the script she asked me to use).  But she&#39;d be in charge of a meaningfully large budget and would have the opportunity to make her own hard choices (or to seek gainful employment).<br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling and earning money","postDate":"1268599388","msgId":52058,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCOUQ0QTVDLjkwMzA4MDJAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDRCOUQyRjRELjcwOTA4MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDc4NjBiMzFlMTAwMzEzMTk0N3Q0NTRiYjNkZWs0MDJhYmY2MTQ5ZmQ1OTA5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8NEI5RDJGNEQuNzA5MDgwMEBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":52053,"nextInTopic":52059,"prevInTime":52057,"nextInTime":52059,"topicId":52031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Things I&#39;ve read about the unschooling way<br/>\n&gt; of life lead me to believe that the position of unschoolers on the topic of<br/>\n&gt; *expecting* your children to earn money for some of their own activities /<br/>\n&gt; items might be a no-no...I&#39;m just guessing.  It seems a bit like coercion to<br/>\n&gt; say, &quot;No, I&#39;m not buying you that.  If you want it, you must earn your own<br/>\n&gt; money, or not have it.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The situation I find myself in has to do with my 14-year-old step-daughter,<br/>\n&gt; who attends public school, but who lives in our house about 99% of the<br/>\n&gt; time.  As she gets older, her needs / wants are increasing.  She wants to<br/>\n&gt; attend school ball-games regularly, and school trips, and she is in a few<br/>\n&gt; dance classes that offer lots of additional competition opportunities for a<br/>\n&gt; fee, and she is wanting more clothing, and driver&#39;s education, and she wants<br/>\n&gt; to go to movies, and buy birthday gifts for her friends, and wants her<br/>\n&gt; horses trained, and wants riding lessons.... the list goes on.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t begrudge her any of this stuff.  She&#39;s getting older, she has more<br/>\n&gt; friends, she is learning what she enjoys and how she wants to spend her<br/>\n&gt; time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My problem is that we are on a pretty restricted budget (aren&#39;t we all?) --<br/>\n&gt; and her dad and I, AND her bio-mom, are finding it harder and harder to keep<br/>\n&gt; up with all her financial wants.  I feel bad, because part of the reason we<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t afford to give her all this stuff that she wants is that her dad and I<br/>\n&gt; have chosen a less-lucrative way of life and we have added two more kids to<br/>\n&gt; our family in the past two years.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think it&#39;s appropriate for us to buy her clothing (within reason, at an<br/>\n&gt; agreed-upon dollar figure, perhaps), to pay for her monthly dance lessons,<br/>\n&gt; to buy a certain dollar-figure&#39;s worth of hair products (she wants really<br/>\n&gt; high-end hair products and stuff that I seriously have a hard time<br/>\n&gt; justifying when we&#39;re buying off-brand everything and living hand-to-mouth),<br/>\n&gt; etc.  But if she wants to go beyond those things, I kind of feel like it<br/>\n&gt; should be up to her to provide the difference.  Example:  I&#39;m willing to pay<br/>\n&gt; $3 for a big bottle of Suave shampoo -- if you want the salon stuff that<br/>\n&gt; costs $10/bottle, you have to find a way to make up the difference.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Also, her grandmother used to always pitch in and get her stuff that we<br/>\n&gt; either couldn&#39;t afford, or that we told her we&#39;d like her to earn her own<br/>\n&gt; money for -- so she&#39;s used to relying on that resource for stuff we can&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; get her.  But her grandmother has recently decided she can no longer keep up<br/>\n&gt; with Caitlin&#39;s needs/wants, and she told Caitlin, &quot;Your cousin (who is two<br/>\n&gt; years younger) is earning her own money for horse lessons; you need to earn<br/>\n&gt; your own money, too.&quot;  We haven&#39;t given her such an ultimatum, but we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; talking about it amongst ourselves -- and trying to figure out how to handle<br/>\n&gt; it.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her dad has offered her opportunities to work for him on the farm and earn<br/>\n&gt; decent wages.  Granted, the money would still come from us, but if we paid<br/>\n&gt; her, and she did the work we needed done, it benefits all of us -- she gets<br/>\n&gt; the money we would otherwise have to pay to an outside employee.  She<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t want to work for her dad, and she doesn&#39;t like farm labor -- which,<br/>\n&gt; for me, is fine.  It hurts her dad&#39;s feelings a little bit, but we both know<br/>\n&gt; that this is our chosen work -- not hers.  So, that&#39;s okay.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her grandfather has offered her work to earn money at his wood-shop -- he<br/>\n&gt; has a small wood business on the side, and seriously needs help.  She<br/>\n&gt; doesn&#39;t really want to do that either.  Okay, no problem.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But we&#39;re stuck now, philosophically, I guess.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Her dad and I and her bio-mom were talking about this the other day -- what<br/>\n&gt; is appropriate for us to fund, and what is appropriate for us to say, &quot;We<br/>\n&gt; really can&#39;t afford that, so if you want to do it, you&#39;ll have to come up<br/>\n&gt; with the money.&quot;  ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And do we keep suggesting possible work ideas for her?  There is a<br/>\n&gt; convenience store in our teeny little town where she could probably get a<br/>\n&gt; few hours after school and on the weekends.  Do we suggest that, or that she<br/>\n&gt; do something like babysit for local families?  How much do we *help,* when<br/>\n&gt; in reality it would be more like *forcing*?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; She really balks at the idea of working at all.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It just seems really outside the realm of an unschooling, peaceful, &quot;yes&quot;<br/>\n&gt; way of life to say, &quot;Yeah, I know you want XYZ, but we aren&#39;t getting it for<br/>\n&gt; you, so either you earn it yourself, or go without.&quot;  Granted, we wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; *say* it that way -- but the effect is the same.  Especially when we know<br/>\n&gt; she really does NOT want to work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My parents had a different way of handling such things when I was young --<br/>\n&gt; they never allowed me to work while I was a student.  &quot;School is your job,&quot;<br/>\n&gt; I was told.  &quot;You don&#39;t need the distraction of a job.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; They also didn&#39;t provide me with opportunities to earn money at home, so --<br/>\n&gt; I got what they provided me, which was a lot, but there was no choice, no<br/>\n&gt; option, no freedom to try and earn something I really wanted.  And if there<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t money for something I wanted, that was that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; To me, that seems a worse than offering the option of working and earning<br/>\n&gt; some money and having the choice to say, &quot;Well, my parents can only afford<br/>\n&gt; for me to go to one dance competition a year, but I have earned enough to<br/>\n&gt; pay the fees for two others that I really want to attend!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t know.

I think it&#39;s the withholding of money, and stinginess, and limitations, that make kids grasping and dishonest and sneaky and desperate.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess part of our problem here is that Caitlin has for many years been subject to the &quot;withholding of money, and stinginess, and limitations.&quot; Not to mention guilt connected with money.  And now, we&#39;ve got a desperate, somewhat dishonest, sneaky, frustrated teen who has no interest in earning money for things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of my interest now is how to support her, given that background, and also, how to change our money attitudes with the younger ones so we don&#39;t do the same thing to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I read some of those old posts, too, I am much more aware of how manipulative my husband&#39;s family is and always has been with money.<br/>\n<br/>\n For example, the cost of gas.  I am always amazed at my husband&#39;s family (my MIL and FIL) by their intensely powerful reaction to the cost of &quot;going somewhere for someone else.&quot;  There is always this huffy sort of, well...if you expect me to come to your dance recital or take you to a dance lesson or drive you to ... XYZ ... how are you going to make it up to me?  Gas ain&#39;t free!  And my husband does it, too.  It&#39;s one thing about him that I struggle with.  Seriously, the cost of going somewhere is not THAT expensive.  Even if, God forbid, we have to drive the pickup.  :)  Granted, we live out in the country, but I can think of a lot more expensive things out there -- not to mention the cost of our relationships.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was growing up, there was never any talk of how much it cost to transport me across town to my violin lessons or dance lessons or art lessons or school functions, etc. etc. etc.  Granted, my parents had money -- I think -- and they NEVER would have made me feel guilty for taking me somewhere.  They&#39;re still like that.  They drive an hour each way regularly to see us, and never mention the cost.  They drive halfway cross the country to help my brother and sister-in-law in times of need, and they never begrudge them the cost.  My husband often marvels at this generosity of theirs, and I think it has had a positive effect on him.  He&#39;s not there yet, but...it definitely makes him think.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time, back when my husband and I first got together, that I suggested establishing a weekly allowance for the kids.  He had a really hard time with this, and really wanted to control it.  He wanted them to *save* 20 percent of every penny they got for allowance or from gifts or that they earned.  He wanted to tell them what they could and couldn&#39;t do with the money -- if they had ideas about it, he would put a judgment on the anticipated expenditure.  &quot;You sure you want to waste it on that?&quot;  he&#39;d say.  Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, it became an ugly situation, where the kids were coming up to their dad and saying things like, &quot;You haven&#39;t paid us our allowance for two weeks.  You owe me $10.&quot;  It became a demand, and my husband, who has, admittedly, mellowed out a lot in the past five years, pretty much said, &quot;We&#39;re done.  No more allowance.  I don&#39;t owe you anything.  You want money, you earn it.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nSince then, we&#39;ve tried several other things, mostly without a lot of success.  There was the &quot;working for the family&quot; thing -- if each kid put in 7 hours of farm labor each week, then after the first 7 hours, they could start earning money at an agreed-upon rate.  That got fairly ugly, too, which is a lot of the reason Caitlin has no interest in working for her dad.  And I don&#39;t blame her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested to my hubby at one point that we give Caitlin (actually all the kids) a flat amount at the beginning of each month -- someone in one of those older threads suggested that -- and that she have the ability to use it as she wished.  We&#39;d pay for her dance lessons, her school lunches, her textbook fees, and an agreed-upon amount for clothing and &quot;necessities&quot; like toiletries, etc.  Then her monthly amount (her allowance), not tied to any chores or work or anything, could be used as she wished for her stuff, no strings attached.  If it was $25 and she knew she wanted to go to XYZ dance competition in three months, she&#39;d have to save it for that, or earn a little extra on the side.  My husband never really got on board with that idea.  We never implemented it.  Seems to me this would be the best way to do it -- but I think the work I have to do is with my husband first.  Maybe if I could help him realize that this gas-for-driving thing is harmful -- he hates it when his parents get all huffy about it, but then he turns around and does it to his daughter...and if we could try a month or so without saying a word about how much it costs to drive anyone anywhere.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is a very stressful issue for him, and he was not raised with a lot of generosity.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSorry I&#39;ve been so wordy on this topic.

I fully believe","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-937335669\">I hope to avoid this scenario with the younger kids, by the way, just simply by virtue of raising them in a more intact, unschooling household.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI fully believe that kids given what they really need emotionally, physically, etc. (kids who are secure) will 1) maybe not feel so needy of material things and (2) choose to work in ways that are fun/interesting for them.  Money will be a secondary perk, and they will learn to use it as necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Caitlin&#39;s case, she hasn&#39;t been raised that way.  She&#39;s had a lot of emotional upheaval in her life, and she tends to follow her bio-mom&#39;s example: *when you feel down about something, shop, or get new stuff any way you can (even if it means borrowing money you never intend to pay back).*  I seriously don&#39;t think the younger kids are going to follow that example; Julian hasn&#39;t been around it as much, and our babies aren&#39;t going to experience that at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess maybe a better question would be -- since Caitlin is who she is and wants what she wants, and since she has been possibly missing something through her life -- do we just bite the financial bullet and get her anything and everything we really can that she wants?  Even if it means not letting the younger kids have something (*can&#39;t afford guitar lessons for Julian because we&#39;re spending so much on his sister*)?  Would that possibly help her feel not so &quot;needy&quot; in other ways and eventually result in her feeling more whole?<br/>\n<br/>\nI will admit that I harbor a desire for her to change -- which I realize is not productive or good for any of us.  I wish she didn&#39;t want the $10 bottle of shampoo and the $900 school trip to Washington, D.C., and the $100 competition fees every time a new dance competition pops up, and the $50 jeans from some brand-name store, and the trip to Orlando for the national dance competition.  But she does want those things.  Is that who she is?  If she were my biological daughter, would I feel differently?  Would I do anything in my power to help her have those things?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the right thing to do to support her emotionally?  Will feeding her material desires feed her emotionally?  Will asking her to get a job to help fulfill her wants somehow break her down emotionally?  Will it make her feel less loved, less secure?<br/>\n<br/>\nCommunication on this topic with her is tricky.  She&#39;s used to lectures from her dad and her mom, and she tends to tune us out -- I&#39;d like to have an adult conversation with her.  Do we show her our budget and have her try and help figure out where we fit in her needs / wants?  I don&#39;t want to make her feel guilty.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo complicated, it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I wouldn&#39;t post it here -- I know our situation is a bit different than that of intact families -- but there may be people who are new to unschooling, whose kids are older and who may be facing the same or similar dilemmas.  Hopefully our situation isn&#39;t too far off to be helpful to others.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":240838916,"authorName":"Deborah McKee Kelly","from":"Deborah McKee Kelly &lt;dlmckee@...&gt;","profile":"hael_harobed","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Unschooling and earning money","postDate":"1268538466","msgId":52031,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4NjBiMzFlMTAwMzEzMTk0N3Q0NTRiYjNkZWs0MDJhYmY2MTQ5ZmQ1OTA5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":52044,"prevInTime":52030,"nextInTime":52032,"topicId":52031,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Thanks to all who commented on my last post about my step-son, Julian, and all our positive happenings.

Things I&#39;ve read about the unschooling way<br/>\nof life lead me to believe that the position of unschoolers on the topic of<br/>\n*expecting* your children to earn money for some of their own activities /<br/>\nitems might be a no-no...I&#39;m just guessing.  It seems a bit like coercion to<br/>\nsay, &quot;No, I&#39;m not buying you that.  If you want it, you must earn your own<br/>\nmoney, or not have it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation I find myself in has to do with my 14-year-old step-daughter,<br/>\nwho attends public school, but who lives in our house about 99% of the<br/>\ntime.  As she gets older, her needs / wants are increasing.  She wants to<br/>\nattend school ball-games regularly, and school trips, and she is in a few<br/>\ndance classes that offer lots of additional competition opportunities for a<br/>\nfee, and she is wanting more clothing, and driver&#39;s education, and she wants<br/>\nto go to movies, and buy birthday gifts for her friends, and wants her<br/>\nhorses trained, and wants riding lessons.... the list goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t begrudge her any of this stuff.  She&#39;s getting older, she has more<br/>\nfriends, she is learning what she enjoys and how she wants to spend her<br/>\ntime.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that we are on a pretty restricted budget (aren&#39;t we all?) --<br/>\nand her dad and I, AND her bio-mom, are finding it harder and harder to keep<br/>\nup with all her financial wants.  I feel bad, because part of the reason we<br/>\ncan&#39;t afford to give her all this stuff that she wants is that her dad and I<br/>\nhave chosen a less-lucrative way of life and we have added two more kids to<br/>\nour family in the past two years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it&#39;s appropriate for us to buy her clothing (within reason, at an<br/>\nagreed-upon dollar figure, perhaps), to pay for her monthly dance lessons,<br/>\nto buy a certain dollar-figure&#39;s worth of hair products (she wants really<br/>\nhigh-end hair products and stuff that I seriously have a hard time<br/>\njustifying when we&#39;re buying off-brand everything and living hand-to-mouth),<br/>\netc.  But if she wants to go beyond those things, I kind of feel like it<br/>\nshould be up to her to provide the difference.  Example:  I&#39;m willing to pay<br/>\n$3 for a big bottle of Suave shampoo -- if you want the salon stuff that<br/>\ncosts $10/bottle, you have to find a way to make up the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, her grandmother used to always pitch in and get her stuff that we<br/>\neither couldn&#39;t afford, or that we told her we&#39;d like her to earn her own<br/>\nmoney for -- so she&#39;s used to relying on that resource for stuff we can&#39;t<br/>\nget her.  But her grandmother has recently decided she can no longer keep up<br/>\nwith Caitlin&#39;s needs/wants, and she told Caitlin, &quot;Your cousin (who is two<br/>\nyears younger) is earning her own money for horse lessons; you need to earn<br/>\nyour own money, too.&quot;  We haven&#39;t given her such an ultimatum, but we&#39;re<br/>\ntalking about it amongst ourselves -- and trying to figure out how to handle<br/>\nit.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad has offered her opportunities to work for him on the farm and earn<br/>\ndecent wages.  Granted, the money would still come from us, but if we paid<br/>\nher, and she did the work we needed done, it benefits all of us -- she gets<br/>\nthe money we would otherwise have to pay to an outside employee.  She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t want to work for her dad, and she doesn&#39;t like farm labor -- which,<br/>\nfor me, is fine.  It hurts her dad&#39;s feelings a little bit, but we both know<br/>\nthat this is our chosen work -- not hers.  So, that&#39;s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer grandfather has offered her work to earn money at his wood-shop -- he<br/>\nhas a small wood business on the side, and seriously needs help.  She<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t really want to do that either.  Okay, no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we&#39;re stuck now, philosophically, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer dad and I and her bio-mom were talking about this the other day -- what<br/>\nis appropriate for us to fund, and what is appropriate for us to say, &quot;We<br/>\nreally can&#39;t afford that, so if you want to do it, you&#39;ll have to come up<br/>\nwith the money.&quot;  ?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd do we keep suggesting possible work ideas for her?  There is a<br/>\nconvenience store in our teeny little town where she could probably get a<br/>\nfew hours after school and on the weekends.  Do we suggest that, or that she<br/>\ndo something like babysit for local families?  How much do we *help,* when<br/>\nin reality it would be more like *forcing*?<br/>\n<br/>\nShe really balks at the idea of working at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just seems really outside the realm of an unschooling, peaceful, &quot;yes&quot;<br/>\nway of life to say, &quot;Yeah, I know you want XYZ, but we aren&#39;t getting it for<br/>\nyou, so either you earn it yourself, or go without.&quot;  Granted, we wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n*say* it that way -- but the effect is the same.  Especially when we know<br/>\nshe really does NOT want to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy parents had a different way of handling such things when I was young --<br/>\nthey never allowed me to work while I was a student.  &quot;School is your job,&quot;<br/>\nI was told.  &quot;You don&#39;t need the distraction of a job.&quot;<br/>\nThey also didn&#39;t provide me with opportunities to earn money at home, so --<br/>\nI got what they provided me, which was a lot, but there was no choice, no<br/>\noption, no freedom to try and earn something I really wanted.  And if there<br/>\nwasn&#39;t money for something I wanted, that was that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, that seems a worse than offering the option of working and earning<br/>\nsome money and having the choice to say, &quot;Well, my parents can only afford<br/>\nfor me to go to one dance competition a year, but I have earned enough to<br/>\npay the fees for two others that I really want to attend!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know.  Any ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52129,"nextTopicId":52176}}
