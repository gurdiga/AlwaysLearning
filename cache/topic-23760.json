For those of you not familiar with Skype it is <br/>\nkindof a cross between MSN messenger and a phone, they can make <br/>\nlists of people on their call lists and can choose to be not <br/>\navailable or offline anytime. So they know when others are online or <br/>\nthey could post a message on the yahoo group (with or without <br/>\nparents help) that someone is available or a new kid would like to <br/>\nmake some friends. <br/>\n    Of course we (parents) could talk using it<br/>\noccasionally as well and should each be responsible for moderating <br/>\nour own child&#39;s activity! Anyhow here is the link for the yahoo <br/>\ngroup:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Freeschoolingkidsnetwork\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Freeschoolingkidsnetwork</a><br/>\nand you will also need to download www.skype.com (owned by ebay)<br/>\nThere is also a chatroom available for people who want to use it <br/>\ninstead. <br/>\n    Lots to think about as we&#39;re just getting started but if you <br/>\nhave a kid who would like to talk with other kids then please join. <br/>\nBarbara</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23754,"nextTopicId":23757}}
