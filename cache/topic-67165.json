It is great that taking a a break from school is an option for her.  Maybe just kind of be around, talking casually about stuff that maybe interests her or some interest you have in common.  Maybe you or someone you know could help her find a place where she can explore her passion for music; maybe a music store, getting her an ipod and/or an itunes gift card, guitar lessons or help starting up a band, etc., even if, once found, she wants to mess around with it by herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso not to diminish your daughter&#39;s words at all, but my boys sometimes skype with young teenage girls, and they are FULL of drama.

I&#39;m going to be firm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know she says it is not family, and rolls her eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe it. Your barely 11 year old is crying herself to sleep at night and you are not sitting beside her on the bed stroking her back. You had to find this out from a facebook post.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you really believe it is people at school who are telling her she is &quot;ruining everyone&#39;s lives&quot;? This strikes me as an idea that she could have absorbed over time from the actions of people around her, including her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople/things at school may be exacerbating her problems, even being their immediate source, but she is feeling disconnected from her family if she believes &quot;no-one&quot; notices her.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like how you catch a cold because you are exposed to the virus in the environment. You won&#39;t have symptoms until the virus reaches a certain load. But how seriously you are affected, even how quickly you get to the virus load, depends on your immune strength. Her family should be her immune strength, in this analogy, but I don&#39;t think it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is perfectly possible to know intellectually (expressed through eye rolling) that your family loves you - without feeling understood, validated or empowered by that love. Even your diffidence - speaking in a &quot;round about&quot; way - could be felt by her as not being noticed. I wonder if she feels compelled to protect your feelings by reassuring you that it is not you, it&#39;s them.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you don&#39;t want to force any issues - but maybe this is a time when an issue, or at least a discussion, should be kinda forced. She is not a long-time-unschooled child, with the deep layers of trust and connection already built through constant contact and mindful parenting. It might be that she needs some more tangible demonstration of your deep interest in her. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt might be good to discuss the actual content of the post - ask questions but bite your tongue if you have to and don&#39;t give advice or suggestions (that she could easily see as judgement). Express that you were worried, but absolutely calmly, without panic. Don&#39;t make her have to protect your feelings by being too emotional. Be doing something physical and light while you talk so that you aren&#39;t both sitting at a table staring at each other. I had a great talk about a difficult situation with Jayn once when we were both rock hopping in a park. She was younger then, but the idea applies. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s something awesome about that idea: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck\">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the case of this girl, feeling powerless, hopeless and disconnected, you really must engage her interest in being home. She has to believe that she is going to something better than school (for all it&#39;s problems). She also may need to believe that she will be able to keep close to those friends she mentions positively.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchool might be awful, but it is also familiar - hence her concern over the activities. That is part of why people are suggesting going on a trip or outings at once. Can you take a trip to see her friend that she is missing? Can you set up a Skype account today so that they can talk?<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce she is home, and the big, overpowering, overshadowing problems caused by school are relieved, then any problems caused by feeling disconnected to her family - lack of trust, lack of validation - these  could well become visible. It could start looking like returning to school is the answer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you immerse yourself in unschooling, and making her life rich, full and purposeful, while you are working outside of the home? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf not you, who?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want unschooling to be successful, rich and joyous you will have to (and I use this phrase intentionally) let go of your attachment to her grades. If she has been valued in the past because of good grades, then her grades &quot;flopping&quot; are feeding in to her feelings of low self-worth. It becomes a vicious cycle, where her bad grades are both a symptom of her anxiety and a cause of more. Anyone talking about how her grades used to be good, and how important good grades are to a happy life, is just adding to the pressure.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I&#39;m going to say something about intention, cognitive dissonance and the unsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren absorb our beliefs and fears about them even when those feelings are unsaid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother never told me I was lazy in so many words, yet I know she had a subconscious belief that I was lazy (implanted in her mind by doctors when I was an infant) that I also internalized. I continued to believe myself lazy despite the enormous evidence to the contrary. <br/>\n<br/>\nBringing these shadowy beliefs into the light of unschooling principles is very important to healing, and to being able to unschool thoughtfully without knee-jerk reactions and old tapes running in our heads.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have tapes running in your head about your own unhappy school experiences as a tween. Are you subconsciously sending her messages about how like you she is? Does this create a sense of inevitability?  <br/>\n<br/>\nYour daughter has tapes running in her head. Some of them might be to do with letting everyone down because her grades are slipping. You can say &quot;they don&#39;t matter&quot; or &quot;it will be alright&quot; all you like, but if in your secret heart you still believe that good grades are the best path to adult happiness and success, she will still absorb that message by osmosis. Better to be honest and upfront about your concerns, and the reading and thinking that you are doing to address them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a story of hope. There was a family who came to conferences a few years ago. The daughter was an older teen, 16 I think, who like your daughter was deeply interested in music.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tragedy of this family was that they had been conventional, typical, schooling and grades driven parents. Their older daughter had committed suicide in high school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey could see their younger daughter slipping away from them too. So they took the step to turn away 180 degrees from their old life, and became radical unschoolers, doing what ever it took to immerse themselves in their daughter&#39;s life, supporting her love of music and singing, and going to a lot of conferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will never forget this beautiful teenager, with an awesome bluesy voice, at the talent show singing a really raunchy, womanly song (some might judge as &quot;inappropriate&quot; for a 16yo), singing it very well, accompanied on the guitar... by her dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease examine your emotional reactions to our suggestions and ideas. If anything I or anyone else wrote brings up feelings of defensiveness, that&#39;s good. That is a really useful sign that here is where some truth lies. It has always been that way for me.<br/>\n  <br/>\nThis whole thing really worries me. When I think of Jayn barely 11, we  had struggles together, but she never went to sleep without me being nearby. She never cried alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

She got her to therapy, and also started her on potato snacks every evening after I told her how helpful the book Potatoes Not Prozac had been for me. One or both of those things together really worked. The idea is that a simple carb eaten plain or with anything but protein, before sleep, and at least 3 hours after the last protein, gives an enormous seratonin boost. The result is vivid dreams and feeling more positive in the morning. It worked magic for me. It&#39;s supposed to be effective for anyone who likes sweets. <br/>\n<br/>\nCould you offer french fries or tater tots? Maybe with a special sauce, if she&#39;s into that? Mashed potatoes? Make an extra fast food run as a late night treat? Most kids would like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy limited experience with therapy from several people through Kaiser who were not homeschoolers was that they did not get it, and it was annoying, and a waste of my time. However, in your position I would look very hard for options that I could sell, or books I could leave lying around. Maybe even buying the Teenage Liberation Handbook and leaving it out somewhere would help. This sounds like a kid who could permanently damage herself without intervention. Writing that you&#39;ve had a knife in your hand is a cry for help. Maybe you could talk to someone else who would have seen it, and ask if they want to present the option you&#39;ve found as something that would help. I know there&#39;s a homeschool mom named Michelle Barone who leans towards unschooling, is a licensed marriage and family therapist, and does phone counseling. Getting counseling for yourself could help her. I know that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing here, and it&#39;s a good place to do it.

[wherever],&quot; that&#39;s different.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you need to borrow money to do it, it might be worth going to another town, get a motel room, see a concert or play or aquarium or something.  Don&#39;t be at all schoolish about it.  Don&#39;t say a thing that makes it seems like an educational field trip.  Just go for fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":472480490,"authorName":"sheeboo2","from":"&quot;sheeboo2&quot; &lt;brmino@...&gt;","profile":"sheeboo2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: scary 11 yr old writing on Facebook","postDate":"1337112957","msgId":67169,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpvdWRodCttNTFjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBREZVMFNCcDdhUlJyN2NBcVczeWNlZS1MdEh3aVc5dUFTMWJMeTItVlhhLVM2dFpSQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67167,"nextInTopic":67170,"prevInTime":67168,"nextInTime":67170,"topicId":67165,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... of an academic year.---- Right.

My life is a never ending black pit of despair. A little voice inside my head telling me to run away from it. Telling me that the only thing worth living for is music. Music makes my life worth living for. Why do I exist when no one even pays any attention to me? Why am I the one that nobody listens to or cares about? The only people who seem to notice me are... S.,Li.,and Ty.. Why did my best friend leave me without any warning and disappear off the face of the planet? Why do I think about killing myself just to get away from it? Do I cry myself to sleep every night? Yes. Have I put a knife up to my neck before? Yes. If anyone actually cares about me,please tell me. Tell me that I belong here on this Earth. That I actually have a purpose,except ruining everyone&#39;s lives. I only have a short time left on this Earth before something drastic happens.=====<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst- the friend leaving she speaks of was took out of school for being sick for 3 weeks and then never returned and the school said the family moved, my daughter is aware of this but still feels lonely by the girl leaving even though I believe the girl had no choice in the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spoke to her in a round about way about some things she said in the above writing but did not bring it up directly as I think she blocked my seeing it on Facebook since my neice pointed it out to me that she had wrote it. I don&#39;t want her to feel I am spying on her either by forcing any issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n She is adamant that her feelings of not being liked-cared about- have to do with kids at school as when I named off family that love her she rolled her eyes and said--- I know that I don&#39;t mean family---.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided that she will not be returning to school next year and to give the school written notice to avoid truancy issues that she will be homeschooling next year as our law requires- <br/>\n<br/>\nI will let her decide whether to go back to school next year as once I told her she did not have to return she was happy at first but then after thinking on it some she brought up some activities they do at school that she will miss out on. I told her it is up to her.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer Dad would prefer she stays in school but if her and I decide something he will trust that we are making the right choice and support us...at least so far anyway he says he will and in our years together he has followed willingly in whatever I chose to do.He is very proud of her being a smart good grades kid but fails to see that this last year her grades are flopping around like a fish out of water. I think his fears are valid as it took me a long time to come to terms that she will be okay if she unschools. I still have my doubts if it is the -right- choice but it appears a better choice than her being as unhappy as she is now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel the grades flopping around are only a beginning to a downfall to rebellion and misery for her and a future without joy, a visible measure of things not right in her life.  I had my life go downhill starting at that age as well I know very much what she feels like being lonely and feeling ostracized--even if she does not see that I do, i am--old-- according to her- so I guess being old means I could not understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell,I could go on but I am feeling I have wrote enough for now and there are many things for the people on this list to point out to me that I cannot see for myself. I am good at boxing myself in and not seeing other choices but feeling lots of have to&#39;s.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I guess I need feedback on her writing and some ideas to help me figure out whatever it may be I need to figure out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I have been reading here for a few months and posted a couple times with a different name but could not use that anymore as it was my work email and not appropriate for this list or work as I did not know the email would show up when posting when i signed up originally. and have read Sandra&#39;s site quite a bit but not completely every link on it. as well as a Dayna Martin Book and some other blogs and articles.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been working on saying yes more and no less and other ideas I got from this list and it&#39;s resources.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67118,"nextTopicId":67176}}
