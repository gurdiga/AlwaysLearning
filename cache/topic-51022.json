I know who a couple of  <br/>\nthem are, but it&#39;s not worth making a deal of it.   They have lists  <br/>\nwith no &quot;face,&quot; no outlet, made of disgruntled and frustrated people  <br/>\nthey pick up here and there, and take to their negative, not-so- <br/>\nhelpful lists.  So if you&#39;re recruited on the side, from this list, it  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t done by someone with good intentions.  And they probably don&#39;t  <br/>\ncount half their members as active as I&#39;ve always done.  They think  <br/>\nthey&#39;re doing something really great, no doubt, but they&#39;re not  <br/>\nhurting me, they&#39;re not hurting this list, and they&#39;re misleading  <br/>\nunschoolers in the dozens.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose John Holt Quotes in handwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/photos/album/1446626140/pic/list\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/photos/album/1446626140/pic/list</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to put them out where people can see them better.
