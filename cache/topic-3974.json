Now, I am anti-death penalty, <br/>\nand I can see where they&#39;re coming from -- And that statement made them sound <br/>\nsilly even to people inclined to be on their side. There seem to be a lot of <br/>\ninstances like that. I remember someone saying once: Communicate in a way <br/>\nthat wins support. PETA rarely does that.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian and I HAVE talked about PETA, and he&#39;s gotten a lot out of the kid&#39;s <br/>\nstuff. He&#39;s joined other organizations that support animal rights, and <br/>\ndonated money. So far he has chosen not to with PETA.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure Julian is a lifer on the vegetarian front, and I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nsurprised if he decides to be a vegan at some point. He decided a few years <br/>\nago he wouldn&#39;t use leather, which makes buying shoes (someday I&#39;ll share the <br/>\ntap shoe saga) a pain in the butt. But he&#39;s also pretty polite to me, the <br/>\nFamily Carnivore. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe critters still live in his head.
