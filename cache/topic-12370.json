Maybe<br/>\nit&#39;s for the kids that go to school.  The reason I say that is that the<br/>\nboy that lives next door to us is the same age as Zak (nearly 8) and a<br/>\ncouple of days ago I heard him outside talking to some older kids about<br/>\na girl he&#39;s going to date and he wants to kiss and spend time with (he<br/>\ngoes to a public school) whereas Zak has no idea what this boy is<br/>\ntalking about... ok enough ranting from me.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nDawn F.<br/>\n<br/>\nTucson, AZ<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12357,"nextTopicId":12487}}
