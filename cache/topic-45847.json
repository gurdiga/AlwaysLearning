You <br/>\nprobably have thoughts like, &quot;He&#39;s 8 years old; he SHOULD be able to <br/>\n.....&quot; fill in the blank with whatever it is he doesn&#39;t do that you <br/>\nthink he should.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be hard for you to turn this around, but you&#39;re well on the way <br/>\nto having truly severe and dangerous issues when he&#39;s older and the <br/>\neffort it will take to turn this around now is far far far less than the <br/>\nheartache and pain you&#39;re setting yourself up for in maybe as little as <br/>\n5 years in the future. Entering the teen years with these dynamics in <br/>\nplace is a recipe for disaster. If you think it is hard now, imagine it <br/>\nwith sex, drugs and alcohol, shoplifting, and so on, added to the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou CAN turn it around, but it will be entirely dependent on whether or <br/>\nnot you and your husband can completely change your attitudes toward <br/>\nhim. He desperately needs you to be on his side, not facing off with him <br/>\nas his adversary. This is going to be very difficult for you because you <br/>\ndon&#39;t really know how to do it. You picked up on the idea of not having <br/>\nlimits, of providing him with the things he wants, but you haven&#39;t <br/>\ngrasped, at all, the idea of being his supporter and facilitator.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe desperately needs you to see him and treat him as a wonderful person <br/>\nwhom you absolutely adore. Not tolerate. Not love in spite of his <br/>\nbehaviors. He needs you to see THROUGH the behaviors to his inner core. <br/>\nOnly you will ever care enough to do that for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get to that point, you will see all his behaviors for what they <br/>\nreally are and you can respond to them appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHEN he feels you are on his side, things will be very different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way things are now, if you tell him, &quot;You&#39;re being too loud,&quot; he&#39;s <br/>\nlikely to get louder - screaming, &quot;I can be as loud as I want,&quot; or <br/>\nsomething like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he feels you are on his side, you can tell him, &quot;You&#39;re being too <br/>\nloud,&quot; and he&#39;s likely to say, &quot;Oh, sorry, thanks for reminding me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously. I know it is hard for  you to imagine it, but it is entirely <br/>\nabout parental attitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause things are already bad between you, you&#39;ll have to set up the <br/>\nenvironment for as much success as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe should NOT be sharing a room with a younger sibling, for example. <br/>\nBut, thinking about that, are you tempted to say to him, &quot;You can&#39;t be <br/>\ntrusted to get along with your siblings, so now life is much more <br/>\ndifficult because we have to find a way to divide up the rooms just to <br/>\ngive you your own room which is a big pain for the rest of us.&quot; How <br/>\nabout, instead, &quot;As the oldest, we think it is important for you to have <br/>\nyour own safe space where your things are private and secure. You are <br/>\nimportant to us and we are totally willing to do what it takes to help <br/>\nyou be happy at home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, when is the last time you snuggled up to watch tv with him? When <br/>\ndid you last go out on your bike and ride around with him?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have three kids, same age separation as yours. I was the oldest of <br/>\nthree kids with the same age separation, too. I KNOW what it means for <br/>\nthe oldest to have their parents totally distracted by younger siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should make a list of his most wonderful characteristics - <br/>\nwhat is lovable, enjoyable, interesting, fun, etc., about him. Make as <br/>\nlong a list, as detailed a list, as you can. Add to it as often as you <br/>\ncan. Put it where you&#39;ll see it a lot. It must be honest. TELL him what <br/>\nyou like about him in very concrete terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a little trick - put 10 rubber bands or hair bands loosely <br/>\naround one wrist. Your goal is to move all those hair bands to the other <br/>\nwrist. Every time you do something that brings you closer to your son, a <br/>\n&quot;relationship-building&quot; thing, you move one to the other wrist. Every <br/>\ntime you do anything that would feel to him like breaking down of your <br/>\nrelationship, move the band back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis will help you learn to speak far more kindly and understandingly to <br/>\nhim. It will help you overlook all but the most egregious behaviors. It <br/>\nwill support YOU in looking for mutually agreeable solutions, rather <br/>\nthan assuming his wants are unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about the example I gave above, of a parent telling a child he is <br/>\nbeing too loud. How would your child FEEL if you told him, &quot;You&#39;re being <br/>\ntoo loud?&quot; What thoughts would go through his head? Stop for a minute <br/>\nand think about that - how your son would react and what his thinking, <br/>\ninside his own head, would be. Go deeper - not just to &quot;I WANT to be <br/>\nloud and I can be and you can&#39;t stop me,&quot; but to what he might be <br/>\nthinking about you at that moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour goal is that, eventually, the thoughts going through his head will <br/>\nbe, &quot;Glad mom is there to help me out when I forget how to behave.&quot;  You <br/>\nwill NEVER get to that point, though, until he feels absolutely sure <br/>\nthat you are WITH him, not against him. Make THAT your top priority - it <br/>\nmight take a long time, this isn&#39;t a quick fix, but very very well worth <br/>\nit. Notice the change ALL has to happen in you, you are not trying to <br/>\nchange him. He will change, but you can&#39;t make him change, you can only <br/>\nchange your own behavior and wait for him to change himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: A Newbie with a Big Problem","postDate":"1245001257","msgId":45862,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMDg5OS45MzY4MC5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwNC5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":45861,"nextInTopic":45863,"prevInTime":45861,"nextInTime":45863,"topicId":45847,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I may very well be misreading the situation, but could your child be crying out for your attention, in his own way?

Your homeschooling experiment failed because he was only schooled at home and not engaged by being at home or out in the world with his family. And you are continuing to do the same thing with him in school. He is forced to find his own entertainment and when you do read with him, engage with him, if he isn&#39;t happy with what you give you get irritated that he isn&#39;t grateful. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if when he wants more engagement you give it to him? If your voice is gone after 4 chapters of Harry Potter offer to do something else with him. Don&#39;t withdraw from activities with him. Keep going.

The puzzle thing was his acting out about the way his<br/>\ngrandmother buys presents for him and his sister that can only be used at<br/>\nher home. She wants them to have things to do when they visit her and she<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t allow them to take the stuff home. He feels that if it is his he<br/>\nshould be able to have it without conditions but his grandmother won&#39;t budge<br/>\non it so it is something he needs to accept.

You should ask him what he finds less boring about school.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it sounds to me as if you might be self-sacrificing. You try to give him everything he wants immediately even when it is inconvenient for you. This naturally makes you a bit angry and annoyed and affects your behaviour toward him whether you intend it to or not. As a result he is never sure about whether he can trust you not to get angry and so he lets any dissatisfaction he feels build up until he releases it by asking you for something you find unreasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou and your child need to find a way of getting things you want without hurting one another. You need to start finding common preferences when you and your child have a conflict. A common preference is an option that you both prefer to whatever you wanted to do originally. You need to pay attention to him a lot more and start heading off problems before he starts hitting people. You need to think creatively about things he might like to do and suggest them in advance. And you need to explain to him that he has a lot to gain by cooperating with other people:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/introductory_articles_on_TCS\">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/introductory_articles_on_TCS</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/introduction_to_taking_children_seriously_tcs\">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/introduction_to_taking_children_seriously_tcs</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/feeling_bad\">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/feeling_bad</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/unschooling_and_schooling_as_a_continuum\">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/unschooling_and_schooling_as_a_continuum</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This post is about him. It has been one of those days when I am so<br/>\n&gt; discouraged I just want to roll up into a ball and stay like that for days.<br/>\n&gt; I have three kids, 3, 5, and 8. My 8 year son is so challenging I am at my<br/>\n&gt; wit&#39;s end.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He was pretty much raised in a very attached home. I breastfed, he co-slept<br/>\n&gt; from the beginning, he was carried every waking moment or he would scream,<br/>\n&gt; and he has been raised with very few arbitrary rules. I did have to work<br/>\n&gt; outside the home until he was almost 4 though. :-( I was raised in a very<br/>\n&gt; verbally and sometime physically abusive environment so I am not saying that<br/>\n&gt; I have been the perfect peaceful parent. I have a temper. But from the<br/>\n&gt; beginning I knew I wanted to raise my kids differently then I was and that<br/>\n&gt; meant no barrage of stupid rules or smothering my kids with endless<br/>\n&gt; expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That&#39;s good.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The problem is that my son is verbally and physically abusive to me and his<br/>\n&gt; siblings. He treats virtually no one with respect even though that is not<br/>\n&gt; the way he is treated. It is starting to rub off on my two other kids as<br/>\n&gt; they learn to handle things the way my oldest does. badly!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Just a few for instance scenarios from today: My oldest was mad that his<br/>\n&gt; three year old brother went into the room they are SUPPOSED to share and got<br/>\n&gt; into his crafting supplies. Never mind the fact that the 3 year old gets<br/>\n&gt; ousted from his own room I have suggested numerous times that if he does not<br/>\n&gt; want his brother to go in there all he needs to do is shut the door, since<br/>\n&gt; baby brother cannot open it. He almost never shuts the door though and in<br/>\n&gt; fact almost never shuts the doors to the house which has resulted in his<br/>\n&gt; brother running outside and into the street. So. his brother messed with his<br/>\n&gt; stuff. He responded by running out of the room and punching his brother in<br/>\n&gt; the back and saying &quot;he deserved it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Why doesn&#39;t he close the door? He wants his brother to come in so he can hit him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I talked to him about it and couldn&#39;t get him to see that he can&#39;t hit his<br/>\n&gt; siblings. He insists that if they do this or that then he WILL hit them. He<br/>\n&gt; tells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems to me that you&#39;re focusing on what he should not do rather than on explaining that the reason he shouldn&#39;t do it is that there are much better ways for him to get what he wants. If he finds common preferences with other people instead of hitting the he gets access not just to the ideas he has about what kinds of things are interesting and fun but also to the ideas of the rest of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Today as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>\n&gt; a puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>\n&gt; in a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>\n&gt; up the puzzle pieces and put it away. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did you offer to buy him another copy of the puzzle? What about buying a new copy of the puzzle for the grandmother and taking her copy?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you see he&#39;s interested in something ask him he cant take away ask him if he would like one well before you have to leave so that he has time to adapt and won&#39;t blow up later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>\n&gt; around some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>\n&gt; up. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>\n&gt; walked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>\n&gt; it broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>\n&gt; assaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>\n&gt; &quot;deserves this&quot;.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; All the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>\n&gt; things to provoke them and then lying about it. A couple times he hit me in<br/>\n&gt; the head while I was driving with something from the back seat. By the time<br/>\n&gt; we got home I had it and sent him to his room.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He doesn&#39;t seem to know how to deal with anger and he could not handle being<br/>\n&gt; made to clean up after his own tantrum so it turned into a 2 hour session of<br/>\n&gt; torturing to get back at us.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>While he is angry he&#39;s not likely to be willing to deal with whatever is bothering him. So you need to try to head things off before he gets angry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He has zero friends because truthfully no one can stand him for long. He<br/>\n&gt; ends up getting bullied at school because he has rather bizarre behavior,<br/>\n&gt; clucking like chicken, shrill screams for no reason, clapping loudly in<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s faces, etc. I assume they are tics of some sort and have often felt<br/>\n&gt; he has some high functioning autism characteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>The only way he knows of getting what he wants is annoying other people until they give him what he wants or he gets rid of them through violence. Also he probably gets a rush from hitting people because of the danger they&#39;ll hit him back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We just moved into a new house and he made a new friend that lasted for all<br/>\n&gt; of 3 days until the parents of the child ordered my son to go away and stay<br/>\n&gt; away.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Yesterday the father came to my door banging loudly and when I opened it he<br/>\n&gt; yelled at me to keep my &quot;KID&quot; off his property. Apparently he sits on his<br/>\n&gt; bike in front of their property or in their driveway, probably hoping the<br/>\n&gt; child will come out. When I told my son that the man came over, he assumed<br/>\n&gt; it was a different neighbor from a completely different street! So he has<br/>\n&gt; already got two families in our new neighborhood mad at us. And<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately for my daughter she is also not allowed to play at the<br/>\n&gt; neighbor&#39;s house because of my son, so he is ruining her friendships too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This morning I caught him yelling at the paper boy to get off our property.<br/>\n&gt; He does not seem to realize or care that this behavior is the reason why he<br/>\n&gt; has no friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; He is also not doing so well adjusting to a new economic situation. My<br/>\n&gt; husband who was absent for most of his formative years cause he was a truck<br/>\n&gt; driver is now home. We decided to do with less money so he could be home all<br/>\n&gt; the time. This means that all the kids have to do with less. We don&#39;t live<br/>\n&gt; in as a nice a house, we don&#39;t give them as many toys and gifts, we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; vacation as much and we used to do a lot. But the finances as well as the<br/>\n&gt; fact that my son doesn&#39;t respect or care for any of his possessions is<br/>\n&gt; wearing thin on us. He has trashed 4 bikes and gone through 4-5 DVD players<br/>\n&gt; in the past 2 years. I don&#39;t think a day goes by when we don&#39;t have at least<br/>\n&gt; 1 tantrum about having to say no to some request that involves us spending<br/>\n&gt; quite a bit of money on him. new rollerblades to replace the ones he left<br/>\n&gt; outside to get ruined, a visit to the water park, a trip to the batting<br/>\n&gt; cages. He has expensive tastes and we cannot fulfill his requests. When we<br/>\n&gt; do it is not good enough. I got season passes to the zoo and he will throw a<br/>\n&gt; fit about not being able to ride the amusement park rides at the theme park<br/>\n&gt; next door or throw a fit if I only stay 4 hours and he doesn&#39;t get to see<br/>\n&gt; every single exhibit. I just feel like nothing we do for him is enough. He<br/>\n&gt; is always unhappy and angry. saying life is unfair, we are unfair, and they<br/>\n&gt; we are bad parents. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I also want to note that he has TONS of freedom. He has no bedtime, chores,<br/>\n&gt; or even any rules beyond don&#39;t hurt anyone or their property. He spends most<br/>\n&gt; of his days out on his bike riding around and playing. by himself. I only<br/>\n&gt; ask that he not go too far away and make me have to mount a search party to<br/>\n&gt; find him. and he usually abides that. In his room he has a 50 inch TV,<br/>\n&gt; cable, two video game consoles, a Nintendo DS, and hundreds of DVDs. He has<br/>\n&gt; no limits on any of it. time or content. So our struggles have nothing to do<br/>\n&gt; with his rebelling against all our unfair rules because there really aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; any. If anything he is rebelling against the only real limitations we have<br/>\n&gt; which are in regards to people and property.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He feels bad because he has bad ideas about how to live his life that lead to him being unable to cooperate with other people. You need to find a time when he&#39;s not angry and talk to him about how to solve problems. You need to explain that he will benefit by finding common preferences with other people.. And you need to understand that you should not try to act as a doormat because that hurts both you and him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Anyway, his behavior is getting so stressful that it has me feeling like a<br/>\n&gt; failure as a parent. I also feel I spend so much time trying to protect my<br/>\n&gt; other kids from him and counteract the negative example he leaves for them.<br/>\n&gt; My daughter is in constant reaction mode. just waiting for him to do<br/>\n&gt; something to her or one of her belongings. I want to cry when I hear my 3<br/>\n&gt; year old saying &quot;stop. your hurting me!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;d recommend keeping your son away from the other two for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Don&#39;t know what to do anymore. when I look at my two younger kids I would<br/>\n&gt; say that attachment parenting, peaceful & respectful parenting, and<br/>\n&gt; unschooling are doing wondrous things. I cannot say the same when I look at<br/>\n&gt; my oldest.. I just wonder what the heck I am doing wrong.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As I write this he just came up to me screaming and demanding to know why I<br/>\n&gt; was in his room messing with his TV and turning the channel. I told him that<br/>\n&gt; I have not been in his room and he screams &quot;LIAR!&quot; at me and runs out of the<br/>\n&gt; house.. Sigh. This is the norm with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Seems to me like the thing to say here is: &quot;Do you want help with your TV?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I am really looking for some advice here. don&#39;t be afraid to hurt my<br/>\n&gt; feelings if I am screwing it all up. I need to find peace for my son for all<br/>\n&gt; our sakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve done some very good things that most people never think of doing. You&#39;ve just focused a bit too much on lack of coercion rather than problem-solving.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlan Forrester<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/\">http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

We decided to do with less money so he could be <br/>\nhome all the time. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m confused about this. When you say &quot;home all the time&quot; do you mean that <br/>\nhe is the primary caregiver undertaking the unschooling, or that his job is <br/>\noutside the home, but doesn&#39;t require travelling? I&#39;m guessing the latter <br/>\nsince he is absent from your story other than this mention, but I don&#39;t want <br/>\nto make recommendations based on a possibly wrong guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it sounds a lot like all your kids are without an adult presence <br/>\nmuch of the time. I mean an immediate, in the same room, right beside them <br/>\nparticipating or observing adult presence. There are many clues in your <br/>\nstory that suggest that you are in another room or part of the house <br/>\naltogether, and only responding after you hear a problem arising, talking <br/>\nafter the blowup has occurred. Immediately after a blowup or meltdown with <br/>\nemotions still running high is the worst time for a lot of words. Another <br/>\nquiet time, when everyone is calm and relaxed, is better for talking over <br/>\nproblems and asking for their ideas for solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it seemed there were frequent blowups with my dd, Jayn, and her <br/>\nneighbor friends, my answer was to be a visible presence. It prevented some <br/>\ninstances and also ensured that one child who was prone to lying couldn&#39;t <br/>\nget away with it, since there was an adult witness. After a time the problem <br/>\nbehaviors faded away, with natural development and maturity on the part of <br/>\nall the kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not the 1950&#39;s when (to judge by contemporary movies) it was <br/>\ncommonplace and apparently expected that kids would roam around <br/>\nneighborhoods on their bikes or afoot. I think your son is wandering off <br/>\nalone too much and too far from home for an evidently immature 8 year old. <br/>\nOTOH it would help if home were more fun so that he wanted to stay there. It <br/>\nsounds like home is a place where he is being expected to entertain himself <br/>\nwith his plethora of gadgets. Jayn loves her Nintendo DS, especially when <br/>\nshe links to Daddy&#39;s. She loves Wii as long as someone is playing with her. <br/>\nShe loves playing on line games, as long as she can frequently show me the <br/>\ndressed up characters she has created.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe too have had changes in our financial circumstances. It has been hard on <br/>\nJayn who has been used to being able to add things to her collections, and <br/>\non all of us because we loved travelling a lot to visit our unschooling <br/>\nfriends. But we have been open with her about our situation and our hopes <br/>\nfor the future. Sometimes she complains and wishes, but most of the time she <br/>\nis happy to make lists, and save towards things. She has even started her <br/>\nown business with the idea of contributing to her own happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn is very obnoxious when she is hungry. She makes poor decisions and <br/>\nspeaks appallingly rudely to me. That is when she is likely to throw stuff. <br/>\nMy dh has recently pointed out that I get cranky and speak haughtily and <br/>\nrudely (without hearing it in myself) when I am hungry too! Maybe your ds is <br/>\ngetting hungry more often and sooner than you would expect. Were there <br/>\nplenty of snacks available at Grandma&#39;s that time?<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn also sometimes irritated her playmates by wanting to be overly <br/>\ncontrolling or bossy - or at least she sounds bossy, without intending to <br/>\nbe. We have had conversations about asking what others would like to play <br/>\nand sharing the decision making process.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about to be summer. Make home much more interesting and fun than school <br/>\nwas, then offer to just stay home and keep on having fun come fall as if <br/>\nschool wasn&#39;t there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

He<br/>\ntells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\ntalk and reasoning and &quot;getting him to see&quot;  is totally ineffective for most 8 year olds, and especially those who are overwhelmed with emotion.   did you try empathy?  without correction first?  without &quot;getting him&quot; to see or accept or acknowledge anything?  LISTENING to him and really getting him - empathizing with his strong emotions, will likely go muuuuuuuuuuuch further with helping him learn, over time, to empathize and listen to others.  and by listen i mean listen - with ears and heart - not &quot;obey&quot; - which is what many people actually mean when they say &quot;listen&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Today as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>\n </span></blockquote>a puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>\nin a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>\nup the puzzle pieces and put it away. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst - i would have seen if it WAS actually possible to borrow the puzzle.  and if not, really truly empathized with how much he wanted to.  then - if he still threw it, i would take that as a sign that he had crossed over in to *totally irrational* phase - and that pushing him further into that zone, with forced cleaning, shaming, etc., would ONLY make things more miserable - and would definitely not teach the lesson intended.  i&#39;d clean it up myself, or ask my parents to do it (hopefully that would work with the relationship) and *get my kid out of there* to a safe space.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>\n </span></blockquote>around some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>\nup. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>\nwalked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>\nit broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>\nassaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>\n&quot;deserves this&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nyeah - whenever i engage in a power struggle with my kids i lose.  even if they do what i want.  because when we engage in a power struggle, we aren&#39;t usually actually trying to get the THING done (was the puzzle really the issue for you?) - we are TRYING to teach a lesson.  and nobody will learn with forced teaching.  that&#39;s kind of a primary basis for unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;All the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>\n </span></blockquote>things to provoke them and then lying about it. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nif you knew he did it, how come he had a chance to lie?  if you asked him &quot;did you ___&quot; when you knew the answer, that is a set up for him to lose.  he needed a partner, not another adversary.  and not to feel like a black sheep - with the &quot;good, younger siblings&quot; agains him....<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.A couple times he hit me in<br/>\n </span></blockquote>the head while I was driving with something from the back seat.

I just feel like nothing we do for him is enough.

I sincerely belive that all children are intelligent, loving persons that will do the best they can within the situation they are in. Our children have many needs that we as parents needs to see to, and one that we usually don´t think so much about is the nutritional needs. Of course we feed them, but the right information about childrens actual nutritional needs is not easy to come by. The big food industri and certinely the pharmaceutical industry have no interest in our childrens wellbeeing, they care about profit. And it still amazes me (after spending a couple of years serching about it)just how much of the &quot;information&quot; about our childrens dietary needs from doctors, schools and other supposedly &quot;neutral&quot; institutions that are funded by theese two major industries. I did my own research and found that our standard diet is very deficient in some important nutrition, mainly the fatsoluble vitamins A, D and E wich are crucial for our brain and nervous system. I live in Sweden and India (please excuse my sometimes crappy english), but the modern diet here is not much different from the standard American one. The addition of theese vitamins to childrens diet (in its natural form, synthetic vitamin pills will not do) have proven miracluos to childrens mental and fysical wellbeeing. My son was four years when I started to give him foods rich in fatsoluble vitamins and he is not a sunshine all the time (then I would be worried!) but he has no tantrums or unreasonable angerattacs anymore. He is a focused and healthy boy now, and it is because his nutritional needs are fulfilled for the first time in his life. I highly recommend to check out www.westonaprice.org and www.healingourchildren.net for more information. Those websites have given me a ton of info that I think everybody needs to read. Good luck to you and your family!<br/>\nSincerely, Karin<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Tiffany&quot; &lt;diapermama@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi all, this is my first post and sorry up front for the novella. I have<br/>\n&gt; been observing for a couple months now. I am not going to classify myself as<br/>\n&gt; a RU... just a mom who sees many benefits of adding unschooling philosophy<br/>\n&gt; to our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting. It is the ideas as<br/>\n&gt; it pertains to the whole family dynamic that appeal to me since my two<br/>\n&gt; school age kids are in public school, their choice. My son (almost 9) did<br/>\n&gt; come home for about 7 months but found being home &quot;too boring&quot; and went back<br/>\n&gt; to school.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This post is about him. It has been one of those days when I am so<br/>\n&gt; discouraged I just want to roll up into a ball and stay like that for days.<br/>\n&gt; I have three kids, 3, 5, and 8. My 8 year son is so challenging I am at my<br/>\n&gt; wit&#39;s end.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He was pretty much raised in a very attached home. I breastfed, he co-slept<br/>\n&gt; from the beginning, he was carried every waking moment or he would scream,<br/>\n&gt; and he has been raised with very few arbitrary rules. I did have to work<br/>\n&gt; outside the home until he was almost 4 though. :-( I was raised in a very<br/>\n&gt; verbally and sometime physically abusive environment so I am not saying that<br/>\n&gt; I have been the perfect peaceful parent. I have a temper. But from the<br/>\n&gt; beginning I knew I wanted to raise my kids differently then I was and that<br/>\n&gt; meant no barrage of stupid rules or smothering my kids with endless<br/>\n&gt; expectations.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The problem is that my son is verbally and physically abusive to me and his<br/>\n&gt; siblings. He treats virtually no one with respect even though that is not<br/>\n&gt; the way he is treated. It is starting to rub off on my two other kids as<br/>\n&gt; they learn to handle things the way my oldest does. badly!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Just a few for instance scenarios from today: My oldest was mad that his<br/>\n&gt; three year old brother went into the room they are SUPPOSED to share and got<br/>\n&gt; into his crafting supplies. Never mind the fact that the 3 year old gets<br/>\n&gt; ousted from his own room I have suggested numerous times that if he does not<br/>\n&gt; want his brother to go in there all he needs to do is shut the door, since<br/>\n&gt; baby brother cannot open it. He almost never shuts the door though and in<br/>\n&gt; fact almost never shuts the doors to the house which has resulted in his<br/>\n&gt; brother running outside and into the street. So. his brother messed with his<br/>\n&gt; stuff. He responded by running out of the room and punching his brother in<br/>\n&gt; the back and saying &quot;he deserved it!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I talked to him about it and couldn&#39;t get him to see that he can&#39;t hit his<br/>\n&gt; siblings. He insists that if they do this or that then he WILL hit them. He<br/>\n&gt; tells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Today as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>\n&gt; a puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>\n&gt; in a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>\n&gt; up the puzzle pieces and put it away. He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>\n&gt; around some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>\n&gt; up. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>\n&gt; walked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>\n&gt; it broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>\n&gt; assaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>\n&gt; &quot;deserves this&quot;.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; All the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>\n&gt; things to provoke them and then lying about it. A couple times he hit me in<br/>\n&gt; the head while I was driving with something from the back seat. By the time<br/>\n&gt; we got home I had it and sent him to his room.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He doesn&#39;t seem to know how to deal with anger and he could not handle being<br/>\n&gt; made to clean up after his own tantrum so it turned into a 2 hour session of<br/>\n&gt; torturing to get back at us.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He has zero friends because truthfully no one can stand him for long. He<br/>\n&gt; ends up getting bullied at school because he has rather bizarre behavior,<br/>\n&gt; clucking like chicken, shrill screams for no reason, clapping loudly in<br/>\n&gt; people&#39;s faces, etc. I assume they are tics of some sort and have often felt<br/>\n&gt; he has some high functioning autism characteristics.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We just moved into a new house and he made a new friend that lasted for all<br/>\n&gt; of 3 days until the parents of the child ordered my son to go away and stay<br/>\n&gt; away.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yesterday the father came to my door banging loudly and when I opened it he<br/>\n&gt; yelled at me to keep my &quot;KID&quot; off his property. Apparently he sits on his<br/>\n&gt; bike in front of their property or in their driveway, probably hoping the<br/>\n&gt; child will come out. When I told my son that the man came over, he assumed<br/>\n&gt; it was a different neighbor from a completely different street! So he has<br/>\n&gt; already got two families in our new neighborhood mad at us. And<br/>\n&gt; unfortunately for my daughter she is also not allowed to play at the<br/>\n&gt; neighbor&#39;s house because of my son, so he is ruining her friendships too.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This morning I caught him yelling at the paper boy to get off our property.<br/>\n&gt; He does not seem to realize or care that this behavior is the reason why he<br/>\n&gt; has no friends.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He is also not doing so well adjusting to a new economic situation. My<br/>\n&gt; husband who was absent for most of his formative years cause he was a truck<br/>\n&gt; driver is now home. We decided to do with less money so he could be home all<br/>\n&gt; the time. This means that all the kids have to do with less. We don&#39;t live<br/>\n&gt; in as a nice a house, we don&#39;t give them as many toys and gifts, we don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; vacation as much and we used to do a lot. But the finances as well as the<br/>\n&gt; fact that my son doesn&#39;t respect or care for any of his possessions is<br/>\n&gt; wearing thin on us. He has trashed 4 bikes and gone through 4-5 DVD players<br/>\n&gt; in the past 2 years. I don&#39;t think a day goes by when we don&#39;t have at least<br/>\n&gt; 1 tantrum about having to say no to some request that involves us spending<br/>\n&gt; quite a bit of money on him. new rollerblades to replace the ones he left<br/>\n&gt; outside to get ruined, a visit to the water park, a trip to the batting<br/>\n&gt; cages. He has expensive tastes and we cannot fulfill his requests. When we<br/>\n&gt; do it is not good enough. I got season passes to the zoo and he will throw a<br/>\n&gt; fit about not being able to ride the amusement park rides at the theme park<br/>\n&gt; next door or throw a fit if I only stay 4 hours and he doesn&#39;t get to see<br/>\n&gt; every single exhibit. I just feel like nothing we do for him is enough. He<br/>\n&gt; is always unhappy and angry. saying life is unfair, we are unfair, and they<br/>\n&gt; we are bad parents. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I also want to note that he has TONS of freedom. He has no bedtime, chores,<br/>\n&gt; or even any rules beyond don&#39;t hurt anyone or their property. He spends most<br/>\n&gt; of his days out on his bike riding around and playing. by himself. I only<br/>\n&gt; ask that he not go too far away and make me have to mount a search party to<br/>\n&gt; find him. and he usually abides that. In his room he has a 50 inch TV,<br/>\n&gt; cable, two video game consoles, a Nintendo DS, and hundreds of DVDs. He has<br/>\n&gt; no limits on any of it. time or content. So our struggles have nothing to do<br/>\n&gt; with his rebelling against all our unfair rules because there really aren&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; any. If anything he is rebelling against the only real limitations we have<br/>\n&gt; which are in regards to people and property.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, his behavior is getting so stressful that it has me feeling like a<br/>\n&gt; failure as a parent. I also feel I spend so much time trying to protect my<br/>\n&gt; other kids from him and counteract the negative example he leaves for them.<br/>\n&gt; My daughter is in constant reaction mode. just waiting for him to do<br/>\n&gt; something to her or one of her belongings. I want to cry when I hear my 3<br/>\n&gt; year old saying &quot;stop. your hurting me!&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Don&#39;t know what to do anymore. when I look at my two younger kids I would<br/>\n&gt; say that attachment parenting, peaceful & respectful parenting, and<br/>\n&gt; unschooling are doing wondrous things. I cannot say the same when I look at<br/>\n&gt; my oldest.. I just wonder what the heck I am doing wrong.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As I write this he just came up to me screaming and demanding to know why I<br/>\n&gt; was in his room messing with his TV and turning the channel. I told him that<br/>\n&gt; I have not been in his room and he screams &quot;LIAR!&quot; at me and runs out of the<br/>\n&gt; house.. Sigh. This is the norm with him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am really looking for some advice here. don&#39;t be afraid to hurt my<br/>\n&gt; feelings if I am screwing it all up.

I have<br/>\nbeen observing for a couple months now. I am not going to classify myself as<br/>\na RU... just a mom who sees many benefits of adding unschooling philosophy<br/>\nto our current ideas on attached, respectful parenting. It is the ideas as<br/>\nit pertains to the whole family dynamic that appeal to me since my two<br/>\nschool age kids are in public school, their choice. My son (almost 9) did<br/>\ncome home for about 7 months but found being home &quot;too boring&quot; and went back<br/>\nto school.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis post is about him. It has been one of those days when I am so<br/>\ndiscouraged I just want to roll up into a ball and stay like that for days.<br/>\nI have three kids, 3, 5, and 8. My 8 year son is so challenging I am at my<br/>\nwit&#39;s end.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe was pretty much raised in a very attached home. I breastfed, he co-slept<br/>\nfrom the beginning, he was carried every waking moment or he would scream,<br/>\nand he has been raised with very few arbitrary rules. I did have to work<br/>\noutside the home until he was almost 4 though. :-( I was raised in a very<br/>\nverbally and sometime physically abusive environment so I am not saying that<br/>\nI have been the perfect peaceful parent. I have a temper. But from the<br/>\nbeginning I knew I wanted to raise my kids differently then I was and that<br/>\nmeant no barrage of stupid rules or smothering my kids with endless<br/>\nexpectations.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that my son is verbally and physically abusive to me and his<br/>\nsiblings. He treats virtually no one with respect even though that is not<br/>\nthe way he is treated. It is starting to rub off on my two other kids as<br/>\nthey learn to handle things the way my oldest does. badly!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few for instance scenarios from today: My oldest was mad that his<br/>\nthree year old brother went into the room they are SUPPOSED to share and got<br/>\ninto his crafting supplies. Never mind the fact that the 3 year old gets<br/>\nousted from his own room I have suggested numerous times that if he does not<br/>\nwant his brother to go in there all he needs to do is shut the door, since<br/>\nbaby brother cannot open it. He almost never shuts the door though and in<br/>\nfact almost never shuts the doors to the house which has resulted in his<br/>\nbrother running outside and into the street. So. his brother messed with his<br/>\nstuff. He responded by running out of the room and punching his brother in<br/>\nthe back and saying &quot;he deserved it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to him about it and couldn&#39;t get him to see that he can&#39;t hit his<br/>\nsiblings. He insists that if they do this or that then he WILL hit them. He<br/>\ntells me matter-o-factly that THIS is the way it is!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nToday as we were leaving his grandmother&#39;s house for a visit he was mad that<br/>\na puzzle she bought had to stay at her home. So he threw it across the room<br/>\nin a rage. I stood by the door and told him we would leave after he picked<br/>\nup the puzzle pieces and put it away. He spent a few minutes throwing it<br/>\naround some more and then realized I was serious and eventually picked it<br/>\nup. He was so furious about having to pick up the mess he made that he<br/>\nwalked out the door smacking a Snapple bottle on the side of the house until<br/>\nit broke and squirted tea all over him. My 5 year daughter laughed and so he<br/>\nassaulted her and started hitting her saying that she laughed so she<br/>\n&quot;deserves this&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAll the way he home he fought with his siblings, often deliberately doing<br/>\nthings to provoke them and then lying about it. A couple times he hit me in<br/>\nthe head while I was driving with something from the back seat. By the time<br/>\nwe got home I had it and sent him to his room.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t seem to know how to deal with anger and he could not handle being<br/>\nmade to clean up after his own tantrum so it turned into a 2 hour session of<br/>\ntorturing to get back at us.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe has zero friends because truthfully no one can stand him for long. He<br/>\nends up getting bullied at school because he has rather bizarre behavior,<br/>\nclucking like chicken, shrill screams for no reason, clapping loudly in<br/>\npeople&#39;s faces, etc. I assume they are tics of some sort and have often felt<br/>\nhe has some high functioning autism characteristics.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWe just moved into a new house and he made a new friend that lasted for all<br/>\nof 3 days until the parents of the child ordered my son to go away and stay<br/>\naway.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday the father came to my door banging loudly and when I opened it he<br/>\nyelled at me to keep my &quot;KID&quot; off his property.

And<br/>\nunfortunately for my daughter she is also not allowed to play at the<br/>\nneighbor&#39;s house because of my son, so he is ruining her friendships too.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I caught him yelling at the paper boy to get off our property.<br/>\nHe does not seem to realize or care that this behavior is the reason why he<br/>\nhas no friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHe is also not doing so well adjusting to a new economic situation.
