She is having difficulty with her 2.5 year old.  A lot of it, from my current perspective (having already gone through that stage once, and also unschooling for a while now), were easy things to change.  But tentative asking led me to the conclusion that she isn&#39;t really too interested in hearing about unschooling, so I mostly just listened to her and gave a little bit of advice.  Anyhow, I brought up how its difficult to not react with strong emotions to some of the ways that toddlers can act.  I remember reading something, but I can&#39;t remember what, that led me to be able to remember that my kid wasn&#39;t trying to make me feel horrible or angry or frustrated - she was just being a kid.  It helped me to take responsibility for my own emotions, and let me respond to my child&#39;s needs.  It led me not to be completely devoid of emotion or frustration (which I hear sometimes from conventional parents trying to be &#39;good&#39; - being unemotional in negative/difficult situations), but to... I don&#39;t know how to describe it.  Maybe its being emotionally honest with myself and my kids.  Not letting my emotions get the better of me, and also letting them know when I am feeling discomfort, anger, frustration, at what they are doing, if it is causing problems for other people (including me sometimes).  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I was wondering if Joyce or Sandra have written about this, so that I could send my friend a link.  She seemed interested in hearing about how to not become so upset at what her daughter does, because she knows that her daughter is just doing what is normal. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: supporting finding alternatives","postDate":"1301601092","msgId":60486,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGluMm0wNCtyY2VwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGluMDJvbitocTU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":60482,"nextInTopic":60537,"prevInTime":60485,"nextInTime":60487,"topicId":60474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***************** There were occasions when I pointed out that George had just hurt someone s feelings, but only occasions.

It won&#39;t help your relationship, won&#39;t help your husband ever be anything *but* an asshole, especially if you are snippy and disapproving in response. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you start with an assumption of positive intent, you get to a different picture of your husband. What could be the positive intent of being a jerk? To protect himself. To protect the hurt little boy inside. Start seeing the hurt little boy, lashing out to stave off more of lifes slings and arrows. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; These things break my heart<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>If getting your heart broken helps to motivate you to do good, then let your heart break For Your Husband. Be warm and soft and giving enough to let him have a sense of safety - to know that its okay to be vulnerable, to be wrong, to be out of his element in your company. If he doesn&#39;t have that sense of safety, he&#39;s unlikely to drop his favorite defense mechanism. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;How do you support a grown man who may not think there&#39;s anything wrong with teasing and put downs find alternatives?  <br/>\n </span></blockquote>***************<br/>\n<br/>\nYou start by giving him a reason to value a different set of choices, and that includes honoring his thoughts and feelings. Chances are, he&#39;s pretty intimidated by the idea of unschooling: it&#39;s *weird*, it&#39;s *not* what others in his social circle are doing, and if his children - His Children! - aren&#39;t measuring up to what he thinks of as reasonable that&#39;s scary! So part of supporting him means easing him along as gently as you can. For him to Be softer, he needs to know that softness isn&#39;t going to get him hurt - that will help him trust that its not going to get his children hurt, too! That&#39;s bound to be one of his fears, that all this lovey-dovey stuff is going to make his kids unfit for real life. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can get him connected with other dads who value gentler parenting (even a little gentler!) that will help. Its excruciatingly hard for men to step away from their defenses even with support - its close to impossible when there are No other men around who are trying to be gentler people. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] supporting finding alternatives","postDate":"1301529280","msgId":60482,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkwMjlGNjM0LUY1NEEtNDgxOC05NzA0LUIxNTM1MkFCOEI0OEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwMzk3Mi44MjM5MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGluMDJvbitocTU3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDAzOTcyLjgyMzkxLnFtQHdlYjExMDQwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60480,"nextInTopic":60486,"prevInTime":60481,"nextInTime":60483,"topicId":60474,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Perhaps that little neighbor girl *should* be more respectful and listen to your husband.
