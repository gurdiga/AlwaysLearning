Maybe I saw Chloe in that other parent&#39;s role and I truly wanted to know if it is something she should be made aware of. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want Chloe inadvertently to get in the middle of the relationship. In the other case, where the mom made her daughter give the money back to Chloe, I didn&#39;t even mention it to Chloe at the time. This being the 3rd instance of this, I felt it was time to seek advice. &nbsp;I appreciate the different perspectives and something to think about.

I know many people who are terribly burdened by debts that they didn&#39;t understand the ramifications of when they took it on, and it seems to affect their quality of life a lot of the time. Does the parent serve a role here, or is that a trial and error thing?<div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Being too generous with money","postDate":"1477587791","msgId":77553,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc0QzcyQThFLURENzktNDNBMi1COUU4LTlBMTI0MDREMzM1QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG51bTNoMysxZHB0YTVqQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG51YWZubyt0MTZibDhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bnVhdHE5KzFqZGc0N3JAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FQditjWXdjM3FGamcyVWVINUw5QXlBTDZpOXd6VEw3R0V2SHo2TVJpWDIzTXhMTThRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8bnVtM2gzKzFkcHRhNWpAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77552,"nextInTopic":77554,"prevInTime":77552,"nextInTime":77554,"topicId":77534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"A story about my own kids and their friends: All our kids had allowance.

I wish it had been more at the time, but it was what it was. It was 75 cents per year of age per week, so a six year old had $4.50, a ten year old had $7.50.  Sixteen year olds had $12 a week.  Like that.  Variously and at different times they would save it on the calendar (not collect it) or in a box or bank or wallet, or spend it as it came.  They got cash gifts sometimes from grandparents or from us.  They all had jobs of various sorts in mid-teens and after.  Kirby collected none of his in his 18th year, so he could get it later.  At some point he cashed out nearly $700.   Not the easiest thing. :-)  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn those years, they had some friends who had more money, and some who had less.  Sometimes money would be pooled or shared, for a meal or a movie.  Sometimes one kid would pay for arcade tokens for the group.  One friend was poor for years, and never had a job until he was 17 or 18, and lived far out of town.  For a couple of years, Kirby and Marty and other friends in that group covered him for meals and movie, and they did it gladly and generously.    When that friend got his first good job, he treated all the other teens wholly to meals he would pay for himself, and bought them all gifts on their birthdays and such for a year or so.  He was SO PROUD to be able to really “pay them back,” though it was never done in a dollar-for-dollar way, but in a generosity for generosity way.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHad any of the parents said “Stop paying for his meals and movies—if his mom doesn’t give him money, you shouldn’t be giving it to him,” that would have marred what was good and positive over an arc of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Being too generous with money","postDate":"1477585138","msgId":77552,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZBMTg2NEI4LTcwQTQtNEE2RC1BNkZDLUFENUMwMzUwNDQyQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDE5NDQwMjc4MzQuMzk5MTA0LjE0Nzc0MDMxNjU4NDJAbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PG51YWZubyt0MTZibDhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bnVhdHE5KzFqZGc0N3JAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8Q0FQditjWXdjM3FGamcyVWVINUw5QXlBTDZpOXd6VEw3R0V2SHo2TVJpWDIzTXhMTThRQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8bnVtM2gzKzFkcHRhNWpAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTk0NDAyNzgzNC4zOTkxMDQuMTQ3NzQwMzE2NTg0MkBtYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":77550,"nextInTopic":77553,"prevInTime":77551,"nextInTime":77553,"topicId":77534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- I wonder if, with an older child, there might be an opportunity to talk about long term financial and life goals, even sit down with a financial planner if","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1800207848\">-=-&quot;I wonder if, with an older child, there might be an opportunity to talk about long term financial and life goals, even sit down with a financial planner if that sounded fun,-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounded terrible to me just to READ, and I’m grown and my husband is retired.<br/>\nPressing a child or teen to “plan for long term financial goals” is really, truly NOT a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey know from playing video games about earning and spending points.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-BUT, if you stop the whole thing, she learns that her mother doesn&#39;t trust her to make good choices and that, maybe, having the most dollars at the end of the day is more important than enjoying those dollars with the people we love.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. Sometimes spending money is the best thing to do with money.  Sometimes it feels good to give money away.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably there are readers here who have given money to strangers.  A friend of mine died last week and the “in lieu of flowers” request was donations to a rural animal rescue group.  I send them $80.  My dead friend will not know.  His girlfriend won’t even know, unless maybe someday she asks whether they ever got any donations.  She won’t know it was from me.   Would I rather have had that $80 in the bank when I died?  I was honoring the memory of a very nice man I had known half or my life and most of his.<br/>\n<br/>\nI’ve seen families recommend giving a child $10 a week, BUT…. $1 was for the offering plate at church, and $2 had to be put in savings.<br/>\nWhy couldn’t they just give the child $7, and do the other sorting themselves?  Because they wanted to control the child and “teach” her how to manage money.  But they weren’t accomplishing their goal.  They were creating a feeling of paucity and loss, which the child will probably make up for someday by NOT saving when the amounts are larger, and NOT giving to the church when they actually hae an income.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are pages about money on my site.  I think the greatest value of allowing children to make choices about money is that the amounts are smaller than they would be if the child’s first chance to make choices happens when they also have rent, utilities, car insurance and other such obligations.   Try not to add the factor of what the mom thinks about what is done, or you could be an irritating ghost in the person’s head for decades.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any shaming or controlling voices in your head, think of how they got there, and how you  might avoid becoming one.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the specific questions being asked in the thread, if you (the parents together) think the child is misusing money or not taking care of it, don’t provide as much money.<br/>\nIF it is earned money that the child worked for, then it’s not your (parents) money.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing clearer about what things are and aren’t can often help you find your own answers.

id=\"ygrps-yiv-122930939\">&quot;I wonder if, with an older child, there might be an opportunity to talk about long term financial and life goals, even sit down with a financial planner if that sounded fun, as a means of developing some perspective about money. Maybe that would enrich the child&#39;s sense of what they want their needy friend slush fund to be.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t think this is where Chloe is at right now but appreciate the advice. &nbsp;She actually is really a good saver and I think it just amounts to the fact that she is a generous person and genuinely wants to help out her friend. I&#39;m also thinking maturity will help too with being a bit more discerning.<div><br></div><div>I will add that this is a friend that she met over in Germany and has known over 4 years. &nbsp;They often spend the night at each other&#39;s house and I&#39;m good friends with her parents. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The mom was fine with my concerns and said if Chloe didn&#39;t feel it was fair, that was fine and then explained why she wasn&#39;t given R. the money. &nbsp;I simply explained I didn&#39;t want her in this role but I really think the mom thought they had a deal which they both agreed on.</div><div><br></div><div>However, a few hours ago Chloe came to me and said that R. wanted something on Roblox for $50.00 and she wanted to keep the $40.00 that R. had given to her earlier that she was going to return and then give R. $10.00 of her own money which she asked me to transfer from her account to mine. &nbsp;I told her it was her money but I did make her aware of the fact that R. was doing this because she couldn&#39;t get the money from her mother. &nbsp; Chloe did say R. gave her a limited edition of something or other from Roblox and she was happy with that. &nbsp;I thought she might keep the blanket since she liked it but she said that was okay and was just going to give her the $10.00 and return the blanket. &nbsp;My husband and I did have a bit of a chuckle because R.&#39;s father is a bit of a wheeler dealer and we think R. might have inherited this gene.</div><div><br></div><div>I did take the money to the bank the other day so I&#39;m going to try and get the money in the bank quicker. &nbsp;I&#39;ll keep an eye on the situation. &nbsp;I&#39;m happy that she is still coming to me to ask about this because she has access to the credit card and could be a bit sneaky about it and hope I don&#39;t check my account that closely so I definitely want to keep the lines of communication open. &nbsp;This is a good friend. &nbsp;I think that now she knows this isn&#39;t something I&#39;m really happy about, she might give it more thought than she did before and not just give large amounts away. However, she knows I&#39;ll take her to the store to buy snacks for sleepovers and that type of thing whenever she wants and I&#39;ve also told her that I&#39;m happy she is such a thoughtful and generous person.<br class=\"ygrps-yiv-122930939yui-cursor\"><div class=\"ygrps-yiv-122930939ygroups-quoted\"><br><br><br></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":495438666,"authorName":"Sarah Thompson","from":"Sarah Thompson &lt;thompsonisland@...&gt;","profile":"wallacesmum","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Being too generous with money","postDate":"1477003822","msgId":77536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBUHYrY1l3YzNxRmpnMlVlSDVMOUF5QUw2aTl3elRMN0dFdkh6Nk1SaVgyM014TE04UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG51YXRxOSsxamRnNDdyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG51YWZubyt0MTZibDhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPiA8bnVhdHE5KzFqZGc0N3JAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77535,"nextInTopic":77545,"prevInTime":77535,"nextInTime":77537,"topicId":77534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been thinking about this all day because it already comes up with my kids sometimes in little ways.

Because they have these goals, they are careful to husband their resources. Sometimes they will use * a little* money for something now, and still save the bulk for later. Sometimes they will get to the goal and go big. I wonder if, with an older child, there might be an opportunity to talk about long term financial and life goals, even sit down with a financial planner if that sounded fun, as a means of developing some perspective about money. Maybe that would enrich the child&#39;s sense of what they want their needy friend slush fund to be. </div><div><br></div><div>In the original post, the fact that the mother even asked if you were okay with this suggests that she recognizes there is something inappropriate about letting your daughter use her money to pay for things they are able but unwilling to buy. It is your daughter&#39;s prerogative to help out her friends, but I agree with you that this seems to cross a boundary. </div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50712510,"authorName":"","from":"michelle_m29@...","profile":"michelle_m29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Being too generous with money","postDate":"1476983433","msgId":77535,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG51YXRxOSsxamRnNDdyQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PG51YWZubyt0MTZibDhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PG51YWZubyt0MTZibDhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":77534,"nextInTopic":77536,"prevInTime":77534,"nextInTime":77536,"topicId":77534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m coming at this differently because my daughter is much older (nineteen now), but I ve had the same question brewing for the past couple of years.

I can&#39;t remember how much it was, maybe sixty bucks, but there was a portion of it that she was absolutely free to spend and then some extra in case of emergency (Emergency in this case understood to mean an actual emergency or a pair of really cute shoes.) Her friend&#39;s boyfriend went to the zoo with them and ice skating and he had no money of his own, so the girls wound up pooling their resources to pay for his admission and lunch. I wasn&#39;t entirely fine with money from our family budget going to pay for her friend&#39;s boyfriend, but it wasn&#39;t a huge big deal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It did make me warn Alex about maybe not letting her friends know how much cash she had access to, or that she had credit cards. From what I can see, she&#39;s generous with her friends. I know she treats one girl to lunch or dinner often because her friend&#39;s parents don&#39;t keep groceries in the house (and the friend&#39;s sister&#39;s homeless friends are eating what there is ) and that she likes some particular restaurants up in Portland that they can&#39;t afford, so if she wants to eat there she knows she has to pay for herself and whoever she&#39;s with. It&#39;s the price of her favorite pho.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There was one gal who was a bit of a leech. I think I posted about that situation a couple of years back, although my question then wasn&#39;t about the money issue. Since then, M has asked my daughter for rides to events, then dumped her the second they got there, and tried to hit her up with a sob story so that Alex, who was staying with her grandparents that night, would see if M could stay too because she had found a ride up buy had no way home. &nbsp;(Because of where we live, there are about four different towns involved in their activities, ranging from 50 to 100 miles from home.) &nbsp; Other acquaintances have popped out of the woodwork before various events to see if she&#39;d drive them -- most recently, it was a guy my daughter had met twice months earlier who was asking about an event four and a half hours away that she wasn&#39;t even going to. I found out about it because she couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d even ask, when she said she knew he wouldn&#39;t chip in for gas and she&#39;d have to feed him too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Next weekend there&#39;s a big cosplay event. One friend is paying for the motel room and Alex is paying for gas and providing transportation. I&#39;m not quite sure who and from where, but they seem to have it worked out.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Last summer, Alex was thinking about giving money to a friend who wouldn&#39;t graduate unless she did summer school and didn&#39;t have the two hundred dollar fees. Friend&#39;s father has been unemployed for a LONG time (a couple of years at least) and Alex wanted to help. She wound up deciding that her friend was unlikely to actually attend the classes and that it would damage the friendship, so she didn&#39;t make the offer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The way I see it, buying snacks or dinner or paying admission is a lot different than just giving a friend money or buying them the same fancy thing you&#39;ve got because they want one. (And it really surprises me that the other girl&#39;s mom in your situation would be okay with it.)</div><div><br></div><div>The sad truth is that there are some people who just seem to be out for what they can get. Back to M, Alex has watched her move from friend to friend when she wants something. Or call a mutual friend and make plans so that the mutual friend will expect Alex to drive M up there. &nbsp;We&#39;ve talked about how it&#39;s nice to help people out (like &nbsp;one gal they&#39;d just meant who wanted to go to the restaurant with everyone else after an event but didn&#39;t have any money on her because it was a spur of the moment thing, so everyone pitched in to her her a sandwich) and how some people seem to make a career out of needing help. And how it can be hard to tell the difference without getting burned a bit. (To be clear, I&#39;m talking about teenagers and kids here, not adults)</div><div><br></div><div>I think what&#39;s working for my daughter is to not be transparent about how much money she has, and maybe a little bit to think about what the other person contributes to the relationship. Not in a score-keeping way...but maybe sort of. She&#39;ll do more for the friend who invites her to spend the weekend often than she would to someone who only calls when they need a ride. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that cold and calculating in real life.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Michelle&nbsp;</div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":165807495,"authorName":"","from":"bonniecrocker2003@...","profile":"bonniecrocker2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Being too generous with money","postDate":"1476969016","msgId":77534,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG51YWZubyt0MTZibDhAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":77535,"prevInTime":77533,"nextInTime":77535,"topicId":77534,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have a couple of issues I would like to bring up in the near future but am requesting immediate feedback on a current issue for now.

She wanted to know if I was okay with this and after speaking to Chloe, I said okay but truthfully I wasn&#39;t at all. &nbsp;After speaking to Chloe further and the mom, I felt that this wasn&#39;t a good idea. &nbsp;Truthfully, I was thinking why would you think my daughter should give your daughter that large amount of money and because I didn&#39;t know how to nicely say it, I said okay which is my fault of course. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe is more than happy to give her friend whatever money she wants simply because she wants her to have what she has and because she has access to a large amount of money, it doesn&#39;t bother her. &nbsp;The items of value really are just an attempt by R. to legitimize the deal when in fact she would get the money from Chloe regardless. &nbsp;Chloe didn&#39;t really care if she got any items at all but one of things, a blanket, she likes.</p><p><br></p><p>Chloe is very generous and has a history of giving money to her friends. &nbsp;I found out a few weeks ago through another mother that her daughter had $60.00 on her and when asked where she got it, she said Chloe. &nbsp;The mother made her daughter give the money back.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason R. doesn&#39;t get the money from her parents is because they won&#39;t give it to her for various reasons i.e. not dong what she is suppose to do around house, not keeping grades up, etc. so she is coming to Chloe to get the money. &nbsp;I told the mom I didn&#39;t feel comfortable in Chloe being placed in this role when the reason is simply because the parents can&#39;t/won&#39;t give their child the money. &nbsp;I think it encourages her friends to take advantage of her or I will say that if I was 12 and my parents wouldn&#39;t give me the money and I knew I had a generous friend, I would certainly get the money from them. I can&#39;t blame them. I have little doubt that she has probably done this on more than one occasion. &nbsp;We had an incident when she was 6 of giving an older boy $60.00 for the sheer pleasure of it and I only knew because her twin brother told on her. &nbsp;It caused a huge issue with the mother of the boy which wasn&#39;t pleasant. &nbsp;That&#39;s at least 3 incidents that I know of.</p><p><br></p><p>She&#39;s very generous and thoughtful and will buy snacks for her friends because she knows they like a certain kind. &nbsp;Last week she had me go to the store so she could buy a bunch of snacks for her friends for a sleepover. We live in Germany and this friend is about to go back to the US in the next month.</p><p><br></p><p>I&#39;m thinking I didn&#39;t handle this well. &nbsp;M<span style=\"word-spacing:normal;\">y question is how do I support her generosity while helping to protect her from those that will see her as bank of Chloe when they need something especially in lieu of the fact that their parents are saying no?</span></p><p><br>Another indication that I didn&#39;t handle this well is that we keep a locked box to put the pet sitting money in and when there is enough, I take it to the bank to put in their accounts. &nbsp;I asked her to keep no more than $20.00 on her for safety and yes, the underhanded reason of hoping if she didn&#39;t have more than that on her, she wouldn&#39;t have it to give away. &nbsp;Well $40.00 was missing the next day from the locked box (she has a brother that likes to count it frequently) and she admitted she took it. This caused more problems because she didn&#39;t wait until it was divided between all 3 of my kids before she took the $40.00 which would be unfair to her brothers as all 3 do the pet sitting. This is an excellent example to those who are reading this of what a child will do when an unnecessary and unfair obstacle is put in the way....become sneaky. &nbsp;That was made clear to me.</p><p><br></p><p>My question is how to handle this now and how to proceed with discussing this further with Chloe?
