Some  <br/>\npeople probably think my unschooling page is a very crazy website.   <br/>\nProbably think Satan sent me, and that I&#39;m advocating the downfall of  <br/>\npharmaceutical companies who supply Ritalin.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday I was talking to a friend of mine, former best friend,  <br/>\nnow gradually distanced for various reasons.  I mention kids behind  <br/>\nus are (or one of them is) dealing drugs over the back fence into the  <br/>\nalley; people park near our back gate, and an exchange is made over  <br/>\nthe wall.  Must involve cell phones.  Keith and I discussed whether  <br/>\nto report, decided no... conversational details flowed both ways.  I  <br/>\nsaid it&#39;s probably the best thing in that kid&#39;s life, maybe the first  <br/>\ntime he&#39;s been successful and not being berated by his dad.   She  <br/>\nsaid &quot;if it&#39;s just pot, it&#39;s not so bad.&quot;  I said maybe, but looked  <br/>\nto be very small packets, so probably cocaine or speed.  Friend said  <br/>\nthat was worse,  and that maybe it was okay for us not to report  <br/>\nthem, as long as they weren&#39;t selling ritalin to kids or anything.    <br/>\nHonestly, at that point her phone was not so clear for some reason,  <br/>\nand I missed a few words, but I laughed and said &quot;Kids have NO  <br/>\nproblem getting Ritalin; it&#39;s the moms who seem to want it.&quot;  My  <br/>\nfriend obviously didn&#39;t think it was funny, and we had to go anyway,  <br/>\nbut I thought it was nigh on hilarious that if it was pot, okay, but  <br/>\nif a kid might get Ritalin, it was becoming my duty to call the cops.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was disappointed this wasn&#39;t about TV, but it&#39;s about Ritalin.  Old  <br/>\nguy in Canada says it&#39;s a shame they&#39;re drugging kids instead of  <br/>\nspanking them.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?\">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?</a> <br/>\nARTICLE_ID=51284  I thought only Americans were that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am THRILLED, giddy, that my kids have never been near someone who  <br/>\nwanted to drug them dumber.  I&#39;m overjoyed that they can watch TV if  <br/>\nthey want to.  I&#39;m relieved that they&#39;re not friends with the kids  <br/>\nbehind us.  They might&#39;ve been, years ago, but those kids who are  <br/>\nyelled at and hit were mean to them, and especially mean to Holly, so  <br/>\nmy kids just started ignoring and avoiding them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":246197982,"authorName":"Ren Allen","from":"&quot;Ren Allen&quot; &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"TV??","postDate":"1155241342","msgId":26719,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGViZzRodStnNG0xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":26720,"prevInTime":26718,"nextInTime":26720,"topicId":26719,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"And is it not ironic that the interview itself was on TV, and so the website architect who heard that and chose it and put it on a webpage to discourage TV","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1707999875\">&quot;And is it not ironic that the interview itself was on TV, and so the<br/>\nwebsite architect who heard that and chose it and put it on a webpage<br/>\nto discourage TV use would never have heard that quote had it not<br/>\nbeen for TV?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it ironic that he reached millions of people through his ad<br/>\ncampaign via television?
