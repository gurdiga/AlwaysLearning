Every single time someone posts something about how technology somehow lessens the connection between people, I can&#39;t help but think about how almost every day my children are on Skype with their friends playing Minecraft or doing something together in that way. &nbsp;That&#39;s an obvious one. &nbsp;Here&#39;s one that is less obvious.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>I have a six year old who is very high energy, high emotion, and one of those kids who often has difficulty in group situations. &nbsp;Long story made short, he wanted a birthday party, but was also very stressed at the very idea of it, knowing that it would probably result in hysterical crying and probably him hitting one or more of the guests. &nbsp;The answer? &nbsp;We had an online Skype birthday party on our home Minecraft server. &nbsp;He was completely thrilled. &nbsp;It was so much easier for him because of the physical distance, but he was still able to connect with the other kids and celebrate his special day. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p>He still sometimes has trouble even playing on Skype, but the nice thing is that he is able to at least get together with other kids even for a bit and then if things are not working out, we can just sign off and try again another time. &nbsp;My point is that for a kid like him, technology is enabling greater connection than would otherwise be realistic for him at this stage in his emotional development. &nbsp;He can test the waters in a way that is safe for him, and for the kids around him, and still satisfy his desire for connection with others.</p></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75296,"nextTopicId":75394}}
