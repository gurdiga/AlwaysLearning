Lexie&#39;s <br/>\nbest friend is an unschooling Greek Orthodox who is also a vegitarian.  <br/>\nWhen she is at our house, we make sure we have plenty of no meat <br/>\nchoices, when we go out to eat, we make sure we choose a place where she <br/>\ncan get food that she desires.  For instance, we were in Vegas, with my <br/>\nbrother and his family, and Hibi, so basically 9 people to feed, all <br/>\nmeat eaters except one.  Everyone but that one wanted to go to In and <br/>\nOut and get hamburgers.  So we all stopped and said, Hibi, what could <br/>\nyou eat there?  Nothing really, she wasn&#39;t in the mood for fries.  So... <br/>\nWhat else could we do.  She remembered that in the hotel there was a <br/>\nsnack shop that had a fruit and vegie with yougart dip and ranch <br/>\ndressing.  So we all went to IN and Out, and then stopped by the hotel <br/>\nand got that for her and we ate in the room.  We respect Hibi&#39;s right to <br/>\neat what she wishes and she respects our right.  If she was a vegan we&#39;d <br/>\ndo the same.  They don&#39;t do a lot of TV, but they know we watch more at <br/>\nour house.  However, Lexie, in deference to Hibi, and also cause they <br/>\nare so busy having fun together, watches less tv when Hibi&#39;s at our house. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about respect.  My  mother did not, at first, agree with long term <br/>\nbreastfeeding.  She thought it made dependent unhealthy children.  But <br/>\nwhen I told her that was the decision we had made, to self wean Lexie, <br/>\nshe respected that and did not discuss it with the girls.  As the girls <br/>\ngrew she changed her mind, but before that change she respected our <br/>\nrights to raise our children and make our decisions.  She&#39;s not too keen <br/>\non homeschooling (although she&#39;s a great fan of Holt and introduced me <br/>\nto him when I was in high school/college) but she respects our <br/>\ndecision.  So I think respect is the key.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe grandma needs to respect the mom&#39;s decision to breastfeed and <br/>\nsupport her daughter.  As children get older they can make their own <br/>\ndecisions, and it becomes more about respecting the individual. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\nnellebelle wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I just got off of the phone with my mother.

That&#39;s why my kids didn&#39;t drive anywhere with my brother during his drinking years or with at least one of my aunts.  It&#39;s why I never left them alone with the step-cousin who molested my younger sister years ago, or even with the uncle who fathered the molester.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI come from varying amounts of dysfunction, some of them soul-toxic if not closely watched.  At the same time, we choose to allow our children a relationship with those relatives, if  only to give them a fair chance to see how people change and why things are what they are.  Will, who&#39;s 18, knows why and how my Dad is dangerous, he even knows why and how his own Dad is dangerous, but I&#39;d never prevent him from seeing either of them if he wants.  I&#39;ve even warned him about his paternal grandparents, and when he was too young to have the perspective or skills to protect himself, I kept him from dangerous people, or at least controlled their access to him.  As the kids get older, they will meet many people who disagree with our choices.  I think it&#39;s important for them to see all this while young so they can gain insight and make their own choices.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSyl<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew Yahoo!

Neither would it be okay for them to spank my child, or let them do truly stupid and dangerous things.  Just because something is free doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s okay to accept crap.  If a relative offered &#39;free&#39; daycare, but refused to respect my wishes about how I want my children treated or fed, then it&#39;s not free -- it comes with conditions.  Then again, my relationship with my Dad is such that we never give him unsupervised access to any child younger than say 10 or so.  My Mom doesn&#39;t necessarily with all my choices, but she can be trusted to respect them, as she does with my neices and nephews, who also have their own way of doing things -- different from both my methods and hers.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t expect anyone to limit my kids access to things like TV, food or games, and I&#39;m a little less sure about allowing access to things like guns, but I won&#39;t have grandparents undermining what I consider to be important choices.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf the &#39;free&#39; daycare comes with untrustworthy risks, then it&#39;s really not free, is it?

TV could be harmful. This was a very powerful statement and I hope that you weren&#39;t impling that we should not have limitations in our lives. <br/>\nFor example, I prefer my children not to watch tv. Thus, the tv is kept is the closet and we bring it out when once a week or more if desired, it is not really an issue. My son has a friend that watches tv constantly and he loves to play with her. I am sure they watch a lot of tv when they play at her house. Which is fine, I hope he is learning that different people do different things in their house. When is Rome do as the Romans. Because my son does not watch a lot of tv many television shows are frightening to him, including most Disney movies. I would hope that her mother would be kind enough to turn off the tv or send my child home if he says, or shows signs, that he is scared or frightened. I hope she would do this in a manor so he wouldn&#39;t feel embarressed. What is appropriate for her child may not be for my child and by inviting my child over the mother needs to be compasionate towards their differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI do argee that trying to protect your child from reality, or what many people consider to be reality, is wrong. As parents we should set the example for moderation and self control. I choose not to swear, but if one of my children chooses to swear as his parent it is my responsibity to let him know that some people may find it offensive. He may swear at home but if Grandma comes over she may get very angry and he needs to accept the consequences that she may impose.<br/>\n<br/>\nJody<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nNew Yahoo!

This is going to sound harsh, but here goes.  As the Mom I get to tell ANYONE who watches my child how it will be done, whether or not I pay them.  If I don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s being done, they won&#39;t get unsupervised access to my kids.  Period.  I&#39;ve made it clear to both my parents -- subtly needed with my Mom, very directly with my Dad -- that their access to my children (their grandchildren) depends entirely on their respect for the rules and choices Gary & I have made.  They got to make their choices for us, and I make mine.  I know it sounds like &#39;play my way or not at all&#39; and that&#39;s exactly what it is.  Part of my job is to protect my kids from the dangerous practices of other people, however well-intended.<br/>\n <br/>\nAs the idea of paying Grandma for daycare so that she has to do it Mom&#39;s way -- don&#39;t trust that to be enough.

If <br/>\nmy dad were to say, &quot;Well there the guns are, but your mom doesn&#39;t have guns <br/>\nat her house, so I&#39;m not going to let you hold mine,&quot; he would be depriving <br/>\nthe child of an excellent opportunity based on MY philosophy of depriving <br/>\nchildren of opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t have such a philosophy.<br/>\nMy philosophy is so much the opposite, that I can&#39;t even assist other <br/>\nfamilies in deprivation.   Courtesy, yes.  Punitive control, no.  Limiting <br/>\nnon-harmful exposure to the world which is there and already in progress, no.

One family had kids who really liked Holly, and the two younger <br/>\nkids were following her around.

Last year I decided to supplement my income while homeschooling.  I decided to take in two girls from the neighborhood and get them on the bus in the morning and get them off the bus in the afternoon.  I think they were probably here for a total of 1 hour in the morning and 1.5 to 2 hours in the afternoon.  The mother was paying me next to nothing for the kids (which I agreed to like an indiot) and I fed them breakfast in the a.m. and a healthy snack in the afternoon.  She insisted that all of their homework be done by the time she picked them up.  I would let them decompress a bit when they got off the bus because these kids were going all day.  On top of it, she was separated from her husband and this guy decided to show up after school unannounced to have visitation with his kids.  No one told me this would happen or asked if it was okay with me.  I didn&#39;t even know this guy, but I guess he didn&#39;t want to visit his kids at their house.  It made me very uncomfortable and he insisted on having my phone number so that he could call them and talk to them at my house for 1/2 at a time.  This guy would come and get his kids riled up, and in the process get my son excited (he has aspergers - autism).  How do you address something like that?  You would think that people have the common sense to know better, but I guess not.  When I finally told her I couldn&#39;t watch her girls anymore, she asked &quot;Is it because of what is going on with my husband?&quot;  I didn&#39;t want to hurt her feelings, so I made up some lame excuse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  From: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>\n  To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\n  Sent: Monday, December 15, 2003 2:05 PM<br/>\n  Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] New Beginnings/Making It Work Help<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  In a message dated 12/15/03 11:49:44 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:nellebelle@...\">nellebelle@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n  &lt;&lt; She babysat this weekend, and my sil had told Alek that he couldn&#39;t watch <br/>\n  TV while at Gramma&#39;s.

That&#39;s RUDE.  It&#39;s like a <br/>\n  surprise inspection, or like because their child has been left here, their own <br/>\n  &quot;visit&quot; lasted from when they dropped the kid off to when they picked them up.   <br/>\n  (I&#39;m thinking of another family that NEVER does any such thing, and they had <br/>\n  never lived this far west before. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\n  This is not to say that we treat guests like they live here.  If a child is <br/>\n  from a family where they don&#39;t use bad language, we totally tone down, and if <br/>\n  anyone slips there&#39;s an apology.  If the kids family really wouldn&#39;t want them <br/>\n  watching R rated movies, all my kids would be really sensitive to that.   I <br/>\n  was listening to the South Park Movie soundtrack once with a family came over <br/>\n  and I didn&#39;t even think about it, but Marty casually went over and turned the <br/>\n  volume way down.<br/>\n<br/>\n  We do that out of courtesy and &quot;hostliness.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  What someone else is doing if they demand their kid can&#39;t do/eat/see/play <br/>\n  this or that is extremely rude, and I wouldn&#39;t even make exceptions if they WERE <br/>\n  paying me.

How can I make this situation work?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, send your response to me, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:joylyn@...\">joylyn@...</a>.
