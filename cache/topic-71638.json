It&#39;s more about trying to meet my friend where she is (which is thinking that her child is so &quot;different&quot;) and that maybe if she read about someone with a similar situation who was choosing to unschool it might create some space for her to consider it someday. As it is, she is choosing to move her son to a third school in three years, including changing houses/towns, while chasing what I think is a chimera of special resources to keep him &quot;on track&quot; with his peers.  And he&#39;s only six. I casually mentioned the idea that children learn to read on their own, sometimes at six sometimes at twelve and it was pretty shocking to her to think about that. I have read so many of the heartfelt regrets posted on your website from parents who came to unschooling later rather than sooner, that I suppose I wish I could spare her and, more importantly, her lovely son, the upheaval, anxiety and sense of failure they are experiencing.
