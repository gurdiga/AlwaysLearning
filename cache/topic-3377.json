That is so<br/>\nscarry.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of Roy&#39;s hands were burned when he was 13 months<br/>\nold.  I had carried him and the laundry out to the<br/>\nclothes-line and put him down on the grass, then<br/>\nturned to hang the laundry.  All of a sudden there was<br/>\nthe most awful wail-scream and I turned to see Roy<br/>\ncrawling backwards from what turned out to be a HOT<br/>\nash pile. Both hands had glove shaped burns. He had<br/>\nthe mummy wraps for weeks and weeks. A debreiding<br/>\n(sp?) at a children&#39;s hospital.  It was horrible. I<br/>\nstill feel anger at the person who left the ash pile<br/>\nwithout saying anything, and at myself for not seeing<br/>\nit before I put Roy down. Roy healed quickly and has<br/>\nonly a small amount of pigment loss on his hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone in the ER and the Nemours Children&#39;s Hospital<br/>\nwas wonderful.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, 34 years ago,in San Jose, Calif. a mother left<br/>\nher toddler with me while she went to hospital to have<br/>\nanother baby.  I didn&#39;t know her name, or the hospital<br/>\nname....she was in a bit of a hurry!! Things were<br/>\ndifferent in those days, amongst some , well, anyway. <br/>\nI was renting a room in a large house with a bunch of<br/>\nstudents.  This house had floor furnaces, which I<br/>\nturned OFF, because of the little 18 month old girl. <br/>\nBut, one of the girl&#39;s boyfriends came to visit,<br/>\ndecided that the furnace must be broken, went down,<br/>\nturned it on, without saying anything.  I came back<br/>\nfrom a walk with the baby, put her down, and she<br/>\nIMMEDIATELY ran over and feel on the furnace grate. I<br/>\ntook me a moment to realize she was burned instead of<br/>\njust hurt from falling.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI DID get questioned by the police at the hospital ER.<br/>\n And, the hospital staff were inclined to not let the<br/>\nchild go back to her mother (she turned out to be in<br/>\nthe same hospital) but had me continue to hold her. <br/>\nIt was awful.  They almost wouldn&#39;t treat the poor<br/>\nbaby, because I wasn&#39;t a guardian!  I was also<br/>\nhorrified at the debrieding (harsh scrubbing) that<br/>\nthey did...and protested loudly! I was only 18. (Feb.<br/>\n1969). It all worked out OK, in the end, as far as I<br/>\nknow.  And the burns were not so bad as I thought.  An<br/>\nburn seems bad to me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPoor little babies and burned hands!! Poor Mama&#39;s. <br/>\n<br/>\nRoy still likes for me to hold both of his hands<br/>\nbetween my hands sometimes, when he feels vulnerable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSharon of the Swamp<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt;Max (2,5 yrs) put his hand on the burner....

Poor little<br/>\nguy.  I hope he has a speedy recovery.  My three year<br/>\nold loves to help me cook, stirring pots for me and<br/>\nsuch.  But he is a very cautious type.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I caught him in the kitchen with a HUGE<br/>\nbutcher knife.  He had gotten the cheese out of the<br/>\nrefrigerator, unwrapped it, gotten a cutting board and<br/>\nfound a knife in the sink.  He pulled up a footstool<br/>\nand was beginning to attempt to cut some cheese when I<br/>\nwalked in and gasped.  I asked him to please not try<br/>\nto cut cheese alone and ask for help, he said &quot;oh, ok<br/>\nMommy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy older boy got 2nd and 3rd degree burns on his hands<br/>\nwhen he was under 2.  He put his hands on a firescreen<br/>\non a gas fireplace that I did not know was on at my<br/>\nparents house.  He ended up with mummy wrapped hands<br/>\nfor some time, with no fingers to use.  But kids heal<br/>\nso quickly.  I can&#39;t remember how long it took for<br/>\nthem to heal, but he had criss-cross shaped burns over<br/>\nboth palms and fingers, and we rushed him to the ER as<br/>\nwell.  They gave us a wonderful burn cream that worked<br/>\nwonders.
