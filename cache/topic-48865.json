THEN I asked Zac if he&#39;d mind setting them aside till Christmas so I&#39;d have some gifts for him, as I don&#39;t have many ideas for him this year.

I am a lurker mostly but thought I&#39;d share on this topic as we<br/>\nhave dealt with it differently for each child.  We have children ages 14,<br/>\n12, 11 and 18 months old.  We have homeschooled via unschooling since the<br/>\nbeginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my oldest was 6 he looked me directly in the face one night after<br/>\ndinner and asked if Santa was real.  It wasn&#39;t that tone of &quot;tell me what I<br/>\nwant to hear&quot; it was &quot;tell me the truth or I&#39;ll never believe anything you<br/>\nsay again&quot;.  He had been asking questions for a few weeks and I had used<br/>\nmany of the suggestions others have shared.&quot;some people believe this&quot; or<br/>\n&quot;when I was a child&quot; or &quot;what do you think?&quot; and many, many other lines to<br/>\nkeep the &quot;magic!&quot;  None of it satisfied him and he finally reached a<br/>\ncritical point.  I sat down beside him and pulled him in close and said, &quot;Do<br/>\nyou want the truth honey or the story that we are all told when we are<br/>\nchildren?&quot;  Of course, he said he wanted the truth.  So I drew in a deep<br/>\nbreath and then we shared about the traditions of Santa and what others have<br/>\ncarried down from generations past.  He just cried at first but then as we<br/>\ntalked he began to realized that &quot;Santa&quot; was a concept and matter of the<br/>\nheart..doing good for others and sharing from our gain.   That year was<br/>\ntough because he &quot;knew&quot; but we began a tradition of him being Santa&#39;s helper<br/>\nin our house.he goes to bed with the other children but sneaks out of bed<br/>\nafter they fall asleep and helps arrange the Santa gifts.  He also helps<br/>\nwith suggesting what Santa should get each of his siblings.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you should know that at 14 and through out his entire life, this is the<br/>\nchild that seeks truth and values that above all else in relationships.  I<br/>\nhonestly believed then, when he was 6, and now even after all these years<br/>\nthat telling him the truth was the right path to travel.  I had a brief<br/>\nflash in my minds eye view before our actual conversation that this was a<br/>\nmake it or break point in our relationship.  And many times since then that<br/>\nhas been confirmed as he has trusted what we share with him because of the<br/>\nfoundation of truth we started.  Recently he said to me, &quot;Mom, you and dad<br/>\nhave a great way of protecting us from too much info until just the<br/>\nappropriate time.  When we need to know, you tell us.  And you trust us to<br/>\nbe able to handle life&#39;s truths when it&#39;s time.  Thank you for knowing and<br/>\nthank you for hugging us when it&#39;s hard to understand and helping us through<br/>\nit.  Life makes so much more sense that way.&quot;  I was like WOW! Where did<br/>\nthat come from..and then I reflected for a bit over all the years and times<br/>\nhe has asked questions and we were truthful and didn&#39;t try to skirt the<br/>\nissues.  Then I looked up and said &quot;Thank you God for your wisdom in those<br/>\ntimes!&quot;  I told my son that there was no way dad and I could parent in our<br/>\nown power that only God can lead parents to teach their children in just the<br/>\nway he needs them to for each individual child!  He was a child with a<br/>\npersonality and heart for truth very early in his life.nothing else would<br/>\nsatisfy.  (Many in his life have referred to him as an &quot;old soul&quot; and wise<br/>\nbeyond his years) My other children will come to the truth as well it will<br/>\njust be later for them.  They have yet to ask about the &quot;Santa&quot; myth and<br/>\nthey love the stories and are still in awe of the &quot;magic&quot; of Santa.  They<br/>\nare starting to question but haven&#39;t had the &quot;tell me the truth&quot; moment.  I<br/>\nanticipate it is coming though.  And we will handle each one as God leads.<br/>\nWho knows..soon enough they&#39;ll all be little elves for the baby!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nMy input on &quot;Santa&quot; is to pray to know your children&#39;s needs and handle each<br/>\none as an individual.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nBlessings, <br/>\n<br/>\n~Mischa in GA<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Santa Claus","postDate":"1259968039","msgId":48900,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDQzEzRUY1LThBODAtNDA3NC1CNTAzLTAwRDZCNjBGRjFCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDExMjA3MTY1NzUtMTI1OTk2NDM3OS1jYXJkaHVfZGVjb21ib2J1bGF0b3JfYmxhY2tiZXJyeS5yaW0ubmV0LTE4NTE5NDg0MjktQGJkYTM4My5iaXN4LnByb2Qub24uYmxhY2tiZXJyeT4=","referencesHeader":"PDExMjA3MTY1NzUtMTI1OTk2NDM3OS1jYXJkaHVfZGVjb21ib2J1bGF0b3JfYmxhY2tiZXJyeS5yaW0ubmV0LTE4NTE5NDg0MjktQGJkYTM4My5iaXN4LnByb2Qub24uYmxhY2tiZXJyeT4="},"prevInTopic":48897,"nextInTopic":48907,"prevInTime":48899,"nextInTime":48901,"topicId":48865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- The funny thing is, we have never told him that he wouldn t get anything due to bad behavior, but I think they see it on all the tv shows and in stores.-=-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1407939947\">-=-<br/>\nThe funny thing is, we have never told him that he wouldn&#39;t get  <br/>\nanything due to bad behavior, but I think they see it on all the tv  <br/>\nshows and in stores.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen this came up yesterday I asked Marty (now 20) whether he had ever  <br/>\nthought it had to do with being good, and he said sort of, but not  <br/>\nfrom us saying things, just from mentions in popular culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":222835102,"authorName":"lalow66","from":"&quot;lalow66&quot; &lt;lalow@...&gt;","profile":"lalow66","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Santa Claus","postDate":"1259964389","msgId":48894,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmYzE1NStwbG84QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDU5NTQ3OS41MjI1LnFtQHdlYjExMDQwNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48893,"nextInTopic":48895,"prevInTime":48893,"nextInTime":48895,"topicId":48865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Santa Claus is discussed as a real person.  My Santa tale when I was a child was that I needed to be in bed asleep for him to leave me gifts.  If a child sees other kids getting those gifts, they may want to get them too.  And if your son sees the other kids believing in Santa and getting those presents, his logic may suggest that he too should believe in order to receive the gifts. The logic may continue that if he doesn&#39;t believe, he may not get the gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI treated the Santa issue with my children differently.  I didn&#39;t encourage the belief in Santa as a real person or a magical being, but a fun make=believe part of Christmas.  My children were fine with knowing it was me & their dad who put out the gifts.  We let them know there would always be Santa gifts and never talked about the naughty side of the holiday.  The Santa gifts were, and still are, put around the tree after the children went to bed.  They were unwrapped to avoid a potential argument of who gets to open them.  Oh, and they love to help me bring the wrapped gifts out of my closet to place around the tree on Christmas Eve.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I let go of the Santa myth when my oldest daughter was 4 yrs. old and I was pregnant with my son.  A school friend shared her story of becoming a big sister when her mom went to Baby Superstore (a real store that sold baby items) to buy another little girl.  My daughter wanted to know why I would buy a boy instead of a girl because she would rather have a sister than a brother.  I really didn&#39;t like that family&#39;s explanation of babies. So I also wanted my children to know the stories behind the fictional characters, Santa, the tooth fairy,and the Easter bunny.  It hasn&#39;t taken away from our holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":242590232,"authorName":"Valentine","from":"Valentine &lt;matsacha33@...&gt;","profile":"matsacha33","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re : [AlwaysLearning] Re: Santa Claus","postDate":"1259927615","msgId":48875,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxMjE2Mi45ODQxMS5xbUB3ZWIyNjUwNy5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhmYWVkaCttMDMzQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48874,"nextInTopic":48880,"prevInTime":48874,"nextInTime":48876,"topicId":48865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"    But it is still there, the good/bad, I am sure, not as much as during the 50s and 60s.

Wyl is 10 1/2 now and <br/>\nstill  enjoys the magic of Santa-as do I. :~)<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Santa Claus","postDate":"1259894440","msgId":48867,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDY3QzRCNTZELTdENTgtNDk2MS04RTI5LTczRkVEODM2NEJFOUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhmOW1zMytrY25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhmOW1zMytrY25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48865,"nextInTopic":48869,"prevInTime":48866,"nextInTime":48868,"topicId":48865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"What I said to my kids was that people don t see Santa Claus and different people believe different things, and that what I did know for sure is that when I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-783784425\">What I said to my kids was that people don&#39;t see Santa Claus and  <br/>\ndifferent people believe different things, and that what I did know  <br/>\nfor sure is that when I was a kid I would put a stocking up and in the  <br/>\nmorning there would be candy and toys, and so maybe they should just  <br/>\ntry that and not worry about the details.<br/>\n<br/>\nI said &quot;People say&quot; a lot, or &quot;When I was little...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":194427255,"authorName":"Julie","from":"&quot;Julie&quot; &lt;jmarkoski@...&gt;","profile":"jmarkoski","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Santa Claus","postDate":"1259888323","msgId":48865,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhmOW1zMytrY25kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":48867,"prevInTime":48864,"nextInTime":48866,"topicId":48865,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, My kids are young--James is 4.25, Tyler is 2.5 and Audrey is 4 months.

This is really the first year James has been cognizant of &quot;Christmas&quot; in any real sense. I assumed that he&#39;d take the Santa story in stride like any other fictional character he reads in stories or sees on TV, but he seems to believe or want to believe that Santa is actually coming to our house to give him presents and seems to want me to confirm/validate that.  I assume that the difference between Santa and Mickey Mouse is that people in his real life have asked him what he&#39;s asking for from Santa, etc and other kids mentioning it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure how to tread in this area.  I don&#39;t want to lie to him and tell him that the fat elf is coming down our chimney and bringing him presents.  He doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; or is disinterested in the &quot;Santa is the spirit of giving and we can all be Santas for each other&quot; idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, both my husband and I loved Christmas as kids but were pretty disillusioned and turned off by Christmas once we knew the &quot;truth about Santa&quot;.  It definitely made us disappointed at being misled and the &quot;magic&quot; of Christmas seemed sorely lacking after the Santa conspiracy (LOL) was uncovered.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what would you do if you had a kid who wanted to believe in the literal, popular media-portrayed Santa, but you want to maintain your credibility with him or her?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49146,"nextTopicId":49198}}
