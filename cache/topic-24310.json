You still have that public school <br/>\nattitude if you are dividing your life and your children&#39;s lives into <br/>\nsubjects and are forcing them to do table-time or bookwork or handwriting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  (Don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;get me wrong, he does have to do work books and hand writing but I don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;force the issue and usually tell him if he wants to watch a non-learning<br/>\n&gt;video he has to do at least 10 pages in one of his work books. More if it<br/>\n&gt;is a really long movie. hee hee hee And I usually don&#39;t get the attitude<br/>\n&gt;when we do it this way!)<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But that is not unschooling.  That is school-at-home.  If he has to, then <br/>\nyou *are* forcing it.  If he can&#39;t do what he wants until he has satisfied <br/>\nyour requirements for school, then you are not unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you are using manipulative and coercive means to make him do it.  That <br/>\nisn&#39;t something to &quot;hee hee hee&quot; about.  That is something to be ashamed of.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you said, &quot;You have to remember that EVERYTHING they do is learning in <br/>\nsome format or another!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no attitude if children are free to choose.

You have to remember<br/>\nthat EVERYTHING they do is learning in some format or another!!!! Cooking<br/>\nis math, reading and science. Teaching them how to use the ATM machine is<br/>\nmath and reading and money concepts. My 2 year old already helps gather<br/>\nlaundry and brings the little trash cans to empty into the big trash<br/>\ncans. When we put the laundry away it becomes a catching game with the<br/>\nsocks, I throw them to my 2 year old and she throws them to her big<br/>\nbrother so they are both learning hand eye coordination. We do also read<br/>\na lot (I even got a Christmas card from the library because we check so<br/>\nmany things out!!! Videos as well as books.) There are a lot of<br/>\neducational videos available like the NOVA series on PBS and Nature<br/>\nvideos, history of wars and ancient civilizations etc. My son is a very<br/>\nvisual learner so we watch a lot of learning videos and he doesn&#39;t even<br/>\nmiss regular TV. We have never watched cartoons unless they were learning<br/>\nor religious cartoons or on PBS. We don&#39;t own a play station etc. and the<br/>\nonly games he has for the computer are actually teaching games like the<br/>\nJump Start series etc. Right now he is &quot;playing&quot; a 4th grade geometry cd.<br/>\nWe Un school so pretty much anything goes at our house. We do LOTS of<br/>\nnature study and the kids garden with their Grannie. My son plays golf<br/>\nwith his Grandpa so that is PE as well as swimming hours every day during<br/>\nthe summer. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou just have to start rethinking everything you do and see it as a<br/>\nlearning tool. Believe me it gets easier as you go along taking advantage<br/>\nof every situation to turn it into a learning experience. (I hated it<br/>\nwhen I was a kid and my parents would say the standard lines of &quot;because<br/>\nI said so&quot; or &quot;because I&#39;m the boss&quot; instead of explaining what ever it<br/>\nwas I had a question to. I think people alienate their children when they<br/>\ndon&#39;t take the time to really connect with their kids and explain &quot;Life&quot;<br/>\nto them. Children tend to grow up feeling resentment and anger towards<br/>\ntheir parents when the parents don&#39;t &quot;bother&quot; to treat their children&#39;s<br/>\nquestions as something valid and worth explaining. The only stupid<br/>\nquestion is the one that isn&#39;t asked!)  It was really easy for me at<br/>\nfirst to have that public school attitude of having to sit down and &quot;do<br/>\nyour home work&quot; but for us that just doesn&#39;t work all the time. (Don&#39;t<br/>\nget me wrong, he does have to do work books and hand writing but I don&#39;t<br/>\nforce the issue and usually tell him if he wants to watch a non-learning<br/>\nvideo he has to do at least 10 pages in one of his work books. More if it<br/>\nis a really long movie. hee hee hee And I usually don&#39;t get the attitude<br/>\nwhen we do it this way!)  He can learn his times tables bouncing a ball<br/>\nagainst the barn wall faster and easier than having to &quot;sit still and<br/>\nfocus&quot;. It is amazing what he can remember when I make it fun or a game.<br/>\nBy 2 1/2 he knew how to say carbonation and knew it meant &quot;bubbles in the<br/>\ncoke&quot; and knew that the flashlight reflected off the windows at night and<br/>\nthat reflection also meant his image in the mirror. People don&#39;t realize<br/>\nthat just because a child cannot verbally communicate so that WE can<br/>\nunderstand him, doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t understand what is said to<br/>\nthem or what is going on around them. My baby will be 2 on the 18th of<br/>\nFebruary but already can follow a three part sentence of &quot;go over there,<br/>\npick that up and put it away&quot; of course I am more specific and tell her<br/>\nexactly where and what to do but you get my meaning. She also knows quite<br/>\na few signs so she can communicate with her hands. This was really<br/>\nhelpful about a year ago and up to this point when she didn&#39;t have as<br/>\nmany verbal skills. But now she has about a 500 word vocabulary. Of<br/>\ncourse Mommie is usually the only person who can understand and translate<br/>\nbut she is using so many new words on a daily basis it amazes me! She<br/>\nalso understands more and hears more than you think she would at this<br/>\nage. (and repeats everything!!!) She was across the room from my husband<br/>\nand I this morning and I told hubby with a lowered voice that they could<br/>\ngo down later while I was taking a nap and get the paper and yesterdays<br/>\nmail. Well she dropped her toy and came running saying &quot;ail ail&quot; she<br/>\nknows we usually drive the car to the mail box because it is about 1/4<br/>\nmile away from the house and she loves going for a ride and wasn&#39;t going<br/>\nto miss out! Especially since it was with her Daddy! <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are blessed to live in a state that has so much freedom to teach our<br/>\nchildren. I am definitely learning too as we go along. I went to public<br/>\nschool until the end of 9th grade then transferred to a private Catholic<br/>\nschool for 10th thru 12th. But I seem to be learning A LOT of things that<br/>\neither weren&#39;t taught or I just don&#39;t remember being taught. Our favorite<br/>\npart of home schooling is the freedom to pursue whatever we want to<br/>\nstudy.  We love snuggling upon the couch with hot chocolate and a book or<br/>\neducational video in the winter and doing most of our school work outside<br/>\nwhen it is spring and summer.  Try checking out 4H and your local<br/>\ncommunity center but also other town&#39;s community centers and home school<br/>\ngroups. I belong to at least 5 or 6 local groups within a 40 mile radius<br/>\nand either get a news letter or and e-mail of what&#39;s going on and I have<br/>\nquite a few &quot;just e-mail&quot; groups to get advice, support and adult<br/>\nconversation! lol We drove 45 minutes the other day to another city that<br/>\nwas offering a FREE 3 to 4 hour archery class. I took my 10 year old son<br/>\nand his 8 year old cousin and they both had a blast. Because we only had<br/>\ngas expenses it was worth the trip and they boys learned quite a bit<br/>\n(remember to always take snacks so you don&#39;t have to eat out unless that<br/>\nis part of the treat too). We are lucky that so many of our small little<br/>\ntowns have their own group activities so we don&#39;t have to drive to far to<br/>\ndo things on a weekly basis. But that doesn&#39;t stop us from taking a road<br/>\ntrip when the time is right or it is really something cool we have been<br/>\nwanting to do. Especially if it is free!!! lol<br/>\n<br/>\nThe greatest advice to newer home schoolers is cherish every single day<br/>\nwith your children even if you don&#39;t think you got anything done.  They<br/>\ngrow up too fast!  There is never enough time to learn everything that<br/>\nthere is to learn in the world, so don&#39;t worry about it. Like I said<br/>\nbefore I am also learning so much more than I ever did in school. And if<br/>\nI don&#39;t know we can always look it up on the Internet. It has been a<br/>\nwealth of information that we have used so many many times from<br/>\neverything to cooking recipes to how to make a catapult and everything in<br/>\nbetween!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps some.<br/>\nBlessings,<br/>\nJulie C.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sun, 12 Feb 2006 08:59:18 -0000 &quot;Rhonda&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:msrhonda63@...\">msrhonda63@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nwrites:<br/>\nHi.

It is something that is mine, that I can and do share with others but don&#39;t have to.  I don&#39;t know that I would feel the same about it if someone else were reading about it.

Just a thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling, in its current definition, means to live as though there were no such thing as school.  To simply ignore that aspect of our society.  Would you ask your son to journal if there was no such thing as school, if tomorrow (future test scores, college entrance) weren&#39;t where you were focused?

My name is Rhonda.  I live in Missouri, and started homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; my son,13, about a year ago.  At first, I tried things from books, and<br/>\n&gt; workbooks.  I have found he is bored with that, and is learning more<br/>\n&gt; by doing things he likes. <br/>\n&gt; He has learned a lot about dinosaurs, and space.  He is also very<br/>\n&gt; interested in planes, monster trucks, and space shuttles.  He builds<br/>\n&gt; with legos a lot, and also has some other models he has put together.<br/>\n&gt; I have him write in a journal about what he is doing, and about<br/>\n&gt; whatever he feels like writing about.  <br/>\n&gt; My question is, how do I know if he is learning enough?  Is there any<br/>\n&gt; way to encourage his interests more?  I live in a state where I am<br/>\n&gt; supposed to document 1000 hours per school year of instruction, and<br/>\n&gt; keep grades, or some alternative way of showing his progress.  I<br/>\n&gt; wonder how I can do that with him directing his studies.  Any <br/>\n&gt; suggestions?He seems less bored with what he is doing than he ever <br/>\n&gt; did with bookwork.<br/>\n&gt; Thanks for any helpful suggestions.<br/>\n&gt; Rhonda<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Yahoo!
