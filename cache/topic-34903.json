I&#39;ve <br/>\nnever had that before.==<br/>\n==Her daughter and Linnaea are close friends, and fortunately she <br/>\ndidn&#39;t decide to shut that off, although she said she was going to.  <br/>\n==<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually lurk inconsistently on this list.  This post from Schuyler <br/>\nstruck a cord with me.  I had a similar situation happen this past <br/>\nyear. A woman who was a good friend got upset with me about <br/>\nsomething that I wrote in an e-mail to her.  It was not something <br/>\nthat I wrote in anger or frustration, and I did not expect it to <br/>\ncreate animosity or anger in response.  Apparently, it did.  I did <br/>\nnot find out for a long time, because the *friend* did not respond <br/>\nor communicate with me about her interpretation of what I had <br/>\nwritten.  She spread word among our mutual friends in our homeschool <br/>\ngroup that she was angry and was not going to send or receive e-<br/>\nmails from me anymore, or talk to me anymore.  We were not in the <br/>\nhabit of talking on a daily basis, so I did not catch on until she <br/>\ndid not follow through on a scheduled play date for our daughters <br/>\n(some time after the e-mail that apparently offended.)  At that <br/>\ntime, I found it odd that I could not reach the *friend* to confirm <br/>\nand solidify the plans for the playdate.  In mentioning the <br/>\nsituation to a mutual friend, I was told that the other woman was <br/>\nangry with me.  Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish my 11yo daughter and her friend were as fortunate as Linnaea <br/>\nand her friend.  In my case, my *friend*&#39;s children and my children <br/>\n(we each have a dd and a ds) had been friends.  When the mother cut <br/>\noff communication with me, she included my children.  It&#39;s <br/>\nunfortuate, because it also affects her own children and other <br/>\nchildren in our homeschool community.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike Schuyler, I felt bad for offending the person.  Once I realized <br/>\nthat my words had that unintended affect, I apologized the next time <br/>\nthat I saw the offended *friend* in person.  I explained that I had <br/>\nnot intended to hurt her and was sorry for that.  She accepted my <br/>\napology but said that she was not ready to talk about it.  I offered <br/>\nto meet some time to talk further as soon as she was ready.  That <br/>\nhas never happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my case, this woman was also my dd&#39;s girl scout leader.  In <br/>\ndeciding not to communicate with me, she quit including us in her <br/>\ncommunications regarding the girl scout events and meetings, even <br/>\nafter I tried to make amends.  Throughout the past year, she has <br/>\nplanned group events that my children are not included in.  Her <br/>\nchildren are still invited to things that my family plans, but they <br/>\ndo not attend, though the four children still get along very well on <br/>\nthe rare occasions that they are together in group gatherings.  I <br/>\nhave had two other occasions where I have tried to reach out to this <br/>\nother parent, once to wish her a happy birthday, and another time to <br/>\nsend simple good wishes to her and her family.  Part of me was <br/>\nhoping that she would *come to her senses* and stop behaving in such <br/>\nan inappropriate way.  That has not happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is all so very unfortunate when a parent acts out in anger, <br/>\nespecially when children become casualty of the behavior.  In <br/>\nreading Schuyler&#39;s comments, I wonder if this kind of thing is not <br/>\ntoo unusual?  It caught me off-guard; I&#39;m not used to this kind of <br/>\nbehavior and personally don&#39;t believe in treating people in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n== I figure there is something irrascible about me that makes other <br/>\npeople uncomfortable and even angry. ==<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that&#39;s it for me, as well! :-)  I have to say that in both <br/>\ncases, it sounds like the other person involved was the irascible <br/>\none!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this kind of thing more common than I realize?  How have other <br/>\nparents dealt with it?  In our case, it affects our unschooling in <br/>\nthat it affects the group of friends who have the shared life <br/>\nphilosophy of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, it has been a lesson in social dynamics.  My dd <br/>\nbecame involved  in the discussion because we needed to decide what <br/>\nto do about girl scouts.  Since it was her activity, it needed to be <br/>\nher decision. Also, the obvious change in friendship and hearing <br/>\nabout activities that she and her brother were not invited to has <br/>\nled to further discussions. Over the year as the situation has <br/>\nprogressed, we have had many conversations about human behavior - <br/>\nkind of a natuaral lesson in psychology/sociology lesson.  She has <br/>\nexpressed to me that she is amazed that an adult would behave in <br/>\nsuch a way.  If she were in school, she would likely be dealing with <br/>\nsocial dynamics, too; these kinds of things often happen in groups <br/>\nof girls in school, but as an unschooler she sees it with an adult, <br/>\nnot among children.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a common phenomenon, either in adult groups or due to the <br/>\nlifestyle that we live?  Has anyone else dealt with a similar <br/>\nsituation?  I guess I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any insights to <br/>\nshare with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks in advance,<br/>\nann in Iowa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Article by unschooled teen critiqued harshly elsewhere","postDate":"1211083878","msgId":34972,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVBRDI3RUU3LTk2QzctNENCRi1CQzRDLTE3QTZBMkVGMDhFOUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGM5Y2ExYmJhMDgwNTE3MTIwOWc2ZWViM2UyY3NjNDgwN2QyZmE5ZjE2MDA5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEE4NUNDNDMwLUY3RkEtNDAzMi1BMzJBLUMwMjY1Q0VDNTMxQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPGcwbjRudCthNThuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8YzljYTFiYmEwODA1MTcxMjA5ZzZlZWIzZTJjc2M0ODA3ZDJmYTlmMTYwMDlAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":34965,"nextInTopic":34985,"prevInTime":34971,"nextInTime":34973,"topicId":34903,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"There s about a ton more there.

Sigh... I think it is okay to let other people talk about you without joining in. Those people who believe you are misguided, like Drew, the lone classical speaker (talk about a point of pride), aren&#39;t going to ever agree with how you represent yourself. Whereas those people who come over and see you being villified and get curious and wander over to Sandradodd.com and discover what you do represent, well, they get to make up their own minds. I think that was where I was going with my no-longer-friend who told everyone else what a baddy I was. I can&#39;t defend myself. If I do I make the fight go on and on and on. I don&#39;t gain anything and she gets the attention that she so craves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that&#39;s what I wanted to say. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the fact that you were banned, talk about giving you the gift of martyrdom! Man excommunicated, very cool. <br/>\n<br/>\n---------------<br/>\nOn the list from which I&#39;m banned, I&#39;m being discussed by name and  <br/>\nit&#39;s pretty irritating not to be able to defend myself at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Last year I spoke at a conference where Sandra was also speaking.  <br/>\nIn listening to her, both in her talks and as she chatted in the  <br/>\nspeakers lounge, it was very clear to me that there was little if any  <br/>\ncommon ground in our views on education or, very probably, our life  <br/>\nphilosophies. (I would doubt she remembers me at all; I was the lone  <br/>\nclassical speaker at a conference dominated by unschoolers.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-In particular, I remember a talk she gave called something like  <br/>\n“Iron Homeschooler” (I’m sure I’m getting that name wrong!). It was a  <br/>\nplay on Iron Chef: people in the audience would throw out a random  <br/>\nword or phrase and Sandra would come up with a whole list of possible  <br/>\nresearch topics to create a unit study. It was funny and apparently  <br/>\ndelighted the audience. But I remember thinking, okay, that’s  <br/>\namusing, but a smattering of research on “blue suede shoes” is not an  <br/>\neducation. It’s trivia.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should defend myself on my blog.  I don&#39;t like to politicize  <br/>\nblogs like that (not mine).  Darn it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDrew Campbell wrote that.  I followed a link.  I found a photo.  I  <br/>\ndon&#39;t recognize him.  He didn&#39;t say which conference.  He wrote this,  <br/>\ntoo, which could also use a clarifying defense:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-For some people “unschooling” means that education is entirely,  <br/>\n100% child-led - and that includes the learning of basic literacy and  <br/>\nnumeracy skills. Others gently guide their children in certain  <br/>\ndirections by “strewing” materials around the house; the parents are  <br/>\nchoosing the material, but the children are choosing whether or not  <br/>\nto pick it up.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t use &quot;child led&quot; as a term or concept.  It&#39;s just too puny,  <br/>\nit&#39;s too thin.  It&#39;s not about a relationship between the child and  <br/>\nthe family.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as to &quot;strewing,&quot; THAT, by God, is my term and concept, and I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t even go there and say so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if anyone here wants to bandy some links about there in my  <br/>\ndefense,  the &quot;smattering of research&quot; was not &quot;research,&quot; it was the  <br/>\nconnections that can be made with and to ANYthing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/dot/elvis\">http://sandradodd.com/dot/elvis</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAs to trivia,<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/triviality\">http://sandradodd.com/triviality</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the history of Catholicism is trivia if one doesn&#39;t believe in  <br/>\nheaven, hell or the infallability of the pope.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s history, too, and I LOVE history, and I could go on for hours  <br/>\nabout the effect on culture of the Catholic church on six continents,  <br/>\nand the protestant reformation, and its effect on things like the  <br/>\ncurrent U.S. Presidential race, and American Education, but unless  <br/>\nit&#39;s going to be on a test, it&#39;s &quot;trivia.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most of all, I have never, once, seen an episode of Iron Chef.

He&#39;s a lifetime UK resident, she was raised in Czechoslovakia<br/>\nunder communist rule, and emigrated to the UK when she could. So,<br/>\ntheir cultural context for things is completely different from ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t even remember what we were discussing; the internet, politics,<br/>\ntechnology, something like that. And my friend, who is an ubergeek,<br/>\npopped off with some factoid. His girlfriend said something about his<br/>\nprodigious grasp of trivia, and he shot back with &quot;well, no, because<br/>\nit&#39;s only trivia if it&#39;s never going to get you free alcohol at the<br/>\nbar.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich reminded me of the small Northern California town where I did my<br/>\nundergrad degree. The botany professor had a deal with a local<br/>\nbarkeep, and he would give one free beverage-of-choice to anyone who<br/>\nknew the correct term for the unrolling of a fern frond (circinate<br/>\nvernation).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you have it... a piece of information that can be used in<br/>\ntrade for a commodity. That makes it not trivia, yes? And yet how many<br/>\npeople live their entire lives happily unaware of it? Probably the<br/>\nvast majority. It&#39;s certainly not curricula in any school I&#39;ve ever<br/>\nbeen to, other than in this one professor&#39;s class. It wasn&#39;t even &quot;on<br/>\nthe test&quot; in any other class. It was just his thing. And here I am,<br/>\nyears later, and I still remember it. Because it had use for me, my<br/>\nbrain categorized it as &quot;useful&quot;. and kept it on the front burner.

I read the gaming article, and Zach&#39;s essay, and Sandra&#39;s words, and all the other comments here. After all that reading, a couple of things occur to me.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  1. Steven Johnson, for all the disagreement many folks have for him here, is apparently successful enough to have published a book, right? So, maybe he knows something about something, even if it&#39;s only what will sell books. Not a complete and total failure, so maybe some of what he has to say has value. I&#39;m open-minded enough to believe I can&#39;t know until I actually read his words.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  2. I&#39;m very saddened by the parents who&#39;ve posted that they have one or a few children who can self-regulate, but another or two who can&#39;t. How sad for those children to know Mom thinks they can&#39;t self-regulate. I noticed that none of those Moms said &#39;yet&#39; about their child&#39;s perceived inability to self-regulate. Does this mean you believe this particular child will never learn to self-regulate? The s/he will always need someone one or something (limits imposed by society, or God, or parents or spouse?) to be regulated? Wow! I can&#39;t imagine truly believing one of my children will never learn to prioritize his life so that he can self-regulate. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  3. As to whether or not it&#39;s okay for Zach to purportedly tell parents how to treat their kids, and the later acknowledgement that maybe he was only talking to unschooling parents, maybe unschooling parents are the only kind he&#39;s known in his life? We are unschoolers, blessed to have a wonderful local community of unschoolers. I don&#39;t think my parents (oops, that should have read &#39;kids&#39;) actually see, up close, any non-unschooling parents. Sure, we know some, but my kids seem not to really notice them nor to internalize what those parents are about. Mainstream parents are something they see on TV, and they really don&#39;t give it much thought. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  4. Drew&#39;s bit about what people (children) must know or learn. I don&#39;t consider the Bible or Iliad to be essential, except in the context of how they do come up as what folks call trivia. Everyone has their own list, I suspect. For Muslims, it now doubt includes the Koran, for Jews the Talmud, for Communists writings of Lenin, and so on. Now, if we&#39;re talking must reads in my world, Atlas Shrugged tops the list -- but at 1000+ pages, it&#39;s not one any of my kids or even my husband have tackled. I don&#39;t even agree with Ayn Rand and I&#39;m certainly not an adherent of objectivism, but it&#39;s an amazing read, as is Stranger In A Strange Land by Heinlein, and even Secret Life of Bees, by Sue Monk Kidd. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  5. My experience of trivia (as one whose head is filled with trivia, admittedly) is that so much of what is dismissed as trivia is really an essential part of the rich tapestry of what it means to live in our world. It&#39;s kind of like my favorite Star Trek-Next Generation episode -- the one where Piccard lands on a planet where they speak only in metaphors and he knows no history of their culture so he can&#39;t communicate. Or in Blast from the Past, where Brendan Fraser walks out of a bomb shelter after 35 yrs totally clueless -- in his own country. Without a head full of trivia -- really comprehensive, contextual knowledge of what has come before -- how do people understand what&#39;s being presented today? Yeah, I&#39;m a history geek, with a crazy-glue memory, so I think the value of &#39;trivia&#39; is seriously under-rated. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  And for the record, I think folks were a little unfair to Sandra Dodd (who knows she can be irritating to some people!) whom I do know personally (guessing most folks here have never met or spoken with Sandra IRL). Then again, in my opinion (not irrefutable fact, just my opinion) many parents are unfair and unkind to their own beloved children (tho often very with the best of intentions -- kind of a benevolent malpractice, if you will) so why be surprised when they&#39;re unfair to a stranger?<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia -- realizing I may not even be posted here after that last remark, but I will copy this to Sandra&#39;s group for them to see!<br/>\n   <br/>\n   So there&#39;s my two cents worth on the latest villification of Sandra Dodd.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":216914372,"authorName":"riasplace3","from":"&quot;riasplace3&quot; &lt;riasplace3@...&gt;","profile":"riasplace3","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Article by unschooled teen critiqued harshly elsewhere","postDate":"1211043342","msgId":34952,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGcwbjJtZSs1YWk2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGcwbWx0dStncDBmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34951,"nextInTopic":34953,"prevInTime":34951,"nextInTime":34953,"topicId":34903,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... wrote: I think the problem with ... it ...

It was a  <br/>\nplay on Iron Chef: people in the audience would throw out a random  <br/>\nword or phrase and Sandra would come up with a whole list of possible  <br/>\nresearch topics to create a unit study. It was funny and apparently  <br/>\ndelighted the audience. But I remember thinking, okay, that’s  <br/>\namusing, but a smattering of research on “blue suede shoes” is not an  <br/>\neducation. It’s trivia.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should defend myself on my blog.  I don&#39;t like to politicize  <br/>\nblogs like that (not mine).

I&#39;ve never had that before. She started a conversation with me when she was in a bad mood about how her children would eat chocolate 24 hours a day if they let them. I said we probably shouldn&#39;t have this conversation. She decided it would be good and David joined in, but she took the greatest offense with me. So, she called me the next day saying she didn&#39;t want to be friends anymore and then went around or called around to the homeschooling group that we have the closest ties with and told everyone that I said she was an effin&#39; bad mother. So we aren&#39;t talking. I mean we say hello and all that, but nothing more. Her daughter and Linnaea are close friends, and fortunately she didn&#39;t decide to shut that off, although she said she was going to. I think her husband didn&#39;t let it go there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI still dwell on it. Actually, my sister in law won&#39;t talk to me anymore either, for much the same reason. I figure there is something irrascible about me that makes other people uncomfortable and even angry. What disturbed me most was having her tell all these other people, people whom I&#39;m not close friends with but who I interact with regularly, lies about me. I didn&#39;t talk about it with anyone, really. I figured it was a private fight. Also I felt really bad for upsetting her. I am the more capable debator, she was disadvantaged coming into the debate. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou aren&#39;t misguided. I&#39;ve read through all of the discussion at her blog, well, skimmed some of the responses. I could write someone&#39;s ear off about human nature, David is just writing a paper on the marginal utility of food and children (Pam, he was so hoping you&#39;d be in Oregon, he just gave a talk on it at UEA and figures he can do an all theoretical paper instead of a data paper, there is a lot of evidence out there that children who have control over what they eat are less prone to bingeing, overeating, and not recognizing the feeling of being full, than children who are told what and when to eat), but that is all from an evolutionary understanding of humans, it isn&#39;t the most comfortable perspective to offer a group of people who want to look at children as being the bearers of Original Sin. Some people don&#39;t want to know that there are other ways of looking at children, at their charges, their chattel. If children can think and measure and make<br/>\n decisions without being limited and controlled and herded, than what was the point of all the misery. The people I find most defensive are the ones most invested. Often the children. I&#39;ve had discussions with kids who have to know that they cannot be as good or as smart or as successful if they don&#39;t go to school. Maybe your words made her to aware of how sandy her foundation is. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n----- Original Message ----<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 17 May, 2008 2:01:05 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Article by unschooled teen critiqued harshly elsewhere<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Does that earn me 100.00 dollars (I only have £ on my keyboard, so  <br/>\nI can&#39;t dollar sign it, without going through a much larger palaver  <br/>\nthan just blathering on).-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I would&#39;ve had to have started siphoning that money IN. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAlbuquerque is in the U.S.  New Mexico is part of the U.S. (Some  <br/>\npeople don&#39;t know that, and I&#39;m facetiously suggesting Schuyler might  <br/>\nbe one of them, though she used to live here.)<br/>\n<br/>\n  Are you just doing Washington and Kansas and straight back home?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe business about getting tossed off the blog stuck in my head a  <br/>\nwhile.

I&#39;ve never been involved much in discussions about video games because they&#39;re not an issue in our house.  They&#39;re available, there are no restrictions.  Sometimes my girls don&#39;t touch them for weeks; sometimes they&#39;re played daily for weeks; sometimes a few hours here and there.  My girls are not addicted, mindless video playing zombies.  They&#39;re happy, interesting, living, learning people who play video games whenever they choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n  However, I do know someone personally whose son would fit the mom&#39;s, from the above blog, description of kids who have no limits set on games/TV, etc.  It&#39;s my sister&#39;s boy, and I know this family very well.  He plays video games from the time he gets home from school until he falls asleep.  He talks video games constantly.  I&#39;ve never seen him indicate interest in anything else.  If a mom like the one above saw my nephew, she would point to him and say &quot;he proves my point&quot;.  But that&#39;s unfair.  Because there&#39;s so much more to it than just video games.  Video games are just one of many things that he could be devoting his time to.  But another huge element in this is parental involvement.  My sister is not involved in her son&#39;s life.  Since he started school she seems to feel that he should be able to entertain himself.  She doesn&#39;t provide anything else for him.  She&#39;s off doing her thing, and there he is - all alone.  And the games are there.  <br/>\n<br/>\n  It reminded me of conversation I had last year with a homeschooling mom.  She was complaining that she was constantly battling her kids over television, and then she asked me how I handled TV.  I told her we didn&#39;t have any restrictions on TV viewing.  She was shocked - I think because my girls didn&#39;t fit the mold she had in mind of what a child would be like with no restrictions.  Her first comment was that if she let her kids watch TV as much as they wanted to they would have Cartoon Network on from morning until night.  That reminded me of the time that my 10 yr old dd and I watched Green Acres all day on TV Land.  We drank hot choclate, snuggled on the couch and made pancakes for dinner in honor of Lisa Douglas.  So I related that story to my friend and told her how I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t miss that opportunity because of restrictions.  She said a day like that once in awhile is fine, but with her kids it would be every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That&#39;s when I start getting this ill feeling in my stomach.  Because it&#39;s said like an insult. As though her kids are too lazy or unmotivated to do anything else unless she tells them what to do.  I&#39;m not very good with choosing my words and tone of voice when in conversations like this, but I took a deep breath and gave it a shot.  I told her at first her kids might watch TV non-stop because they&#39;ve haven&#39;t been able to before but that it would probably not last.  That if it did, it would be because there wasn&#39;t anything better to do, and that it was her job as a mom to make her home an interesting and alive place to live.  I think she got a little irritated at that - my placing the responsibility on her but I went ahead to say how children often times don&#39;t have the means - money, ability to schedule activities, transportation, help with the details - to do many things they would like.  Just because a kid can read and write and tell you what they want, doesn&#39;t mean they can make it happen.  I don&#39;t know if she ever changed her rules about TV, but I guess she had something new to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I&#39;ve since regretted I said &#39;something better to do&#39;, because I didn&#39;t mean that. That&#39;s ranking TV below other activities. Sometimes there is something better to do like going to the zoo, or fishing, or whatever, and sometimes watching TV is the better thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So that was all to say that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just video games, but the whole homelife that plays a huge part in it.  Life needs to be interesting and alive and big and varied.  And from all that if they choose video games or TV, good.  But a lot of times mind choose other things, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Janet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Article by unschooled teen critiqued harshly elsewhere","postDate":"1210975998","msgId":34932,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM5QTIzQjlFLTRBODEtNEU3MC04MUQ2LTM0MjNCMEQ5RkI1RkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGQyZi4yMGQzYjQ2My4zNTVmNTEzMUBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGQyZi4yMGQzYjQ2My4zNTVmNTEzMUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":34931,"nextInTopic":34933,"prevInTime":34931,"nextInTime":34933,"topicId":34903,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I ve been thrown off that blog now anyway.  http://sandradodd.blogspot.com I commented a bit about it there.

His mom would like to spare  <br/>\nhim the knowledge for a while, or maybe always.  I don&#39;t blame her at  <br/>\nall.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the not-so-balanced critique:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://barefootmeandering.com/archives/2008/05/from-the-misguided-\">http://barefootmeandering.com/archives/2008/05/from-the-misguided-</a> <br/>\nparent-files/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe blog author&#39;s mind won&#39;t be changed, but some of her readers&#39;  <br/>\nmight.  Go gently, if you go, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":34992,"nextTopicId":5089}}
