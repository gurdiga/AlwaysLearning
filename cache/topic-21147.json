That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;convince him that unschooling is a terrific option.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   My husband is the exception as well.  Not only did he love school, do<br/>\nwell<br/>\n&gt;   with the grades, loved taking tests (he would sign up for them just for<br/>\n&gt;   fun), but he also remembers most of what he learned.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   But have faith... he was willing to hear what it was like for me in<br/>\nschool<br/>\n&gt;   and to consider that not everyone learns like he does.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   He also knows he could have learned just as well without school and<br/>\n&gt;   teachers, and often teaches himself whatever he&#39;s interesetd in, so I<br/>\n&gt; don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt;   think he really had the idea that school was the magic deal.  But this<br/>\n&gt;   might be one important difference... if your dh feels that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; have<br/>\n&gt;   been able to learn all of the stuff he did without school then it will<br/>\nbe<br/>\n&gt; a<br/>\n&gt;   much harder case.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   &gt;He will only read one book. So which one is the best one he should<br/>\nread.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   Could you explain what his objections are again?  I&#39;d be willing to talk<br/>\n&gt;   with my husband about them and see if he has any recommendations.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;   ciao<br/>\n&gt;   --bc--<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;         Yahoo!

Statistical methods are designed to generalize from <br/>\nsample data - but that requires the assumption that the sample families <br/>\nhave commonalities that we can discover. Statistical analysis is the <br/>\ndiscovery of those commonalities.

I have<br/>\nlearned more since quitting college...much of what I&#39;m sure I received great<br/>\ngrades for....I knew little of history (I could recite a few dates but had<br/>\nno context for most of it), only enough math to do what I needed, I was<br/>\nexposed to very little good literature, I couldn&#39;t diagram a sentence if my<br/>\nlife depended on it (I probably still can&#39;t)...I knew lots of science though<br/>\nbecause that was what I loved.

Shortly after doing so I was introduced to un-schooling and<br/>\n&gt; immediately became intrigued with it. I started to get involved with<br/>\n&gt; a group of unschoolers and have been exploring it every since and<br/>\n&gt; have taken alot of it to heart. We&#39;ve been having all the ups and<br/>\n&gt; downs that are expected btw. Including my child appearing that she is<br/>\n&gt; learning nothing, and doing nothing. Which sometimes I myself wonder<br/>\n&gt; about.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; However, my husband is really making a hard case why he is against<br/>\n&gt; unschooling and this has been causing problems for us. We&#39;ve actually<br/>\n&gt; been having some heated arguments on the subject. I have doubts from<br/>\n&gt; time to time just like everyone else, but I&#39;m not ready to give up on<br/>\n&gt; unschooling just yet and I&#39;m getting upset with my husband because he<br/>\n&gt; won&#39;t be more open minded about it. I&#39;ve been all over the place<br/>\n&gt; trying to find information for my husband because he wants facts<br/>\n&gt; about unschooling, not anecdotes.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; He won&#39;t join any groups for unschool dads because he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\n&gt; belong to message boards where there is a biased slant. I&#39;m very<br/>\n&gt; frustrated that he won&#39;t at least get on one and start asking<br/>\n&gt; questions. He is getting advice from people who have never re-<br/>\n&gt; searched unschooling so I think they are very biased too and are not<br/>\n&gt; going to always give the best advice or information.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; For instance he has spoken with one of his best teachers about it.<br/>\n&gt; This educator has 25 years experience and Russell has high respect<br/>\n&gt; for him as an educator.

The people who are *not* particularly successful, happy or<br/>\nproductive are also primarily products of the same system! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps: what it seems to me that most Unschoolers are doing is trying<br/>\nto live in the present, making lives for our children as joyful, successful<br/>\n(by their individual definitions) and productive (of happiness) in the<br/>\npresent as we can. We are not waiting for them to be adults who have &quot;turned<br/>\nout&quot; any particular way for their real lives to begin. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going to recommend Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s book &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;<br/>\nto you. I recommend it to *you* because Valerie lived a remarkable<br/>\nUnschooling life with her dd, Laurie, and a hostile-to-it dh. I would<br/>\nrecommend it to your dh because Laurie&#39;s academic success is just what a<br/>\npragmatic man is likely to want to hear about. *sigh*.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t say how old your dd is.

Shortly after doing so I was introduced to un-schooling and <br/>\nimmediately became intrigued with it. I started to get involved with <br/>\na group of unschoolers and have been exploring it every since and <br/>\nhave taken alot of it to heart. We&#39;ve been having all the ups and <br/>\ndowns that are expected btw. Including my child appearing that she is <br/>\nlearning nothing, and doing nothing. Which sometimes I myself wonder <br/>\nabout. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, my husband is really making a hard case why he is against <br/>\nunschooling and this has been causing problems for us. We&#39;ve actually <br/>\nbeen having some heated arguments on the subject. I have doubts from <br/>\ntime to time just like everyone else, but I&#39;m not ready to give up on <br/>\nunschooling just yet and I&#39;m getting upset with my husband because he <br/>\nwon&#39;t be more open minded about it.
