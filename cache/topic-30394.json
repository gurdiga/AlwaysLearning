Isn&#39;t this <br/>\nvery similar to a child choosing what interests her or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to chime in here about some personal experiences. My mother really didn&#39;t bother to talk to me about basic etiquette growing up. It just wasn&#39;t improtant to her and she was somewhat of a nonconformist herself. Well, in my teen years when I started to date and go places with friends and their parents I was terribly embarassed more than once. My friends parents and/or boyfriends parents weren&#39;t very kind when pointing out my mistakes. I wished my mother had just told me and then I would have at least known how to handle public situations. I wish I had at least been informed and had the tools when I needed them most. As far as I&#39;m concerned, talking to my children about etiquette and public manners is for thier sake, not necessarily for other people.
