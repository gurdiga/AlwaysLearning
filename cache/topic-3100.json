BLECH!!!<br/>\nAs to the area: We have many many unschooling (to them) families and many<br/>\nrelaxed eclectics. The HS community here is very large and very organized.<br/>\nSecular HSers and Religious HSers rarely run into each other and when they<br/>\ndo, the religion is rarely discussed. I started an unschooling support group<br/>\nin my immediate a few years ago and while it has attracted many people,<br/>\nthere are probably 5 families who actually &quot;get it&quot; about unschooling. I<br/>\nthink there are many more out there in other parts of the DC area but most<br/>\nhave older kids and have started to move away from support group activities.<br/>\nToo bad, since they are so important to the new comers!<br/>\nElissa, who will soon be singing<br/>\nYippee - Kai - Yay!</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9440128,"authorName":"ElissaJC@concentric.net","from":"&lt;ElissaJC@...&gt;","profile":"elissajc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] State Laws","postDate":"1012224437","msgId":3100,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNDYwMWMxYTdmZiQ4NjU0ZmJhMCQzOTM4YWRjZUBFbGlzc2FKQz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":3102,"prevInTime":3099,"nextInTime":3101,"topicId":3100,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Pam said: But Maryland has good homeschooling laws (so I hear) and what about places like Virginia or West Virginia Nope.

Maryland has very *nosy* laws. Portfolio reviews at least 2 times a<br/>\nyear teaching 5 subjects and teaching methods, written work and progress<br/>\nsubject to review by a teacher. They can be gotten around (the laws) but it<br/>\ntakes a very strong person to put up with thier BS (or a strict school at<br/>\nhomer) I think it is extremely stressful to unschool in this state. West<br/>\nvirginia has a similar process with the reviews but I believe they can go to<br/>\nyour house and &quot;observe instruction&quot; and I think they also test.
