Her least favorite of them all.<br/>\nThey had to be there for over 5 hours and were stuffed in a back room <br/>\nfor most of it.  They only did the munchkin scene, then came out for <br/>\ncurtain call. The show lasted over 2 1/2 hours.<br/>\nThey put in an extra show (2 in one day)the 2nd weekend because it <br/>\nwas doing so well, and they had to be there from 1:00pm to 11:pm that <br/>\nday, mostly in the back room.  <br/>\nThough in the end, she was glad she had been a part of it.<br/>\nMy son too.  They made some new friends and felt proud of the <br/>\nproduction.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If a really moral person puts on really bad plays, and a <br/>\n </span></blockquote>questionable person <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with a too-exciting life puts on really GOOD plays, which play <br/>\n </span></blockquote>would you <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; rather be in?  Watch?&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I think I would rather my daughter be in a bad play that the kids <br/>\nwere really a part of.  Respected.  A bad play, where she had a good <br/>\ntime.  Way more than a good play/successful play, and not enjoy it so <br/>\nmuch.  She&#39;s done both.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-I&#39;m wondering how wary I should be now.

It might not matter enough for them not to want to be a <br/>\npart, but it does matter.  My experience with this show has been, <br/>\nwhen you add the adults, it&#39;s not all about the children anymore.  <br/>\nThe other shows were more about the kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; If the group is a private theatre company and the director owns it, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>then if <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; there&#39;s profit to be made it&#39;s his.
