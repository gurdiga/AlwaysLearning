I know a lot of families believe that Consensual<br/>\nliving combines nicely with Unschooling and I think in a lot of ways it<br/>\ndoes.  However, I don&#39;t think parents and children are on a level playing<br/>\nfield because adults have the ability to do more than the children.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if it was something that only *I* noticed, but, it seemed to me that<br/>\nsome parents were using the Consensual living creed that &quot;everyone&#39;s opinion<br/>\nmatters and everyone&#39;s equal&quot; as an excuse to put limitations on their<br/>\nchildren.  I&#39;ve noticed the TV, computer and food limitations being<br/>\nmentioned as something that &quot;mom wants&quot; and so that gets equal value as the<br/>\nchild that wants to watch TV or eat chocolate.  So as a compromise the child<br/>\nwould get limited TV or a certain amount of the food they wanted.  It felt<br/>\nreally yucky to me to read.

Neufeld&#39;s book is written within the context of  <br/>\nthe mainstream Western world (though it questions mainstream  <br/>\nparenting) but I think that by reading the book it would be very  <br/>\ndifficult to interpret adult-oriented as meaning a parent controls or  <br/>\ncoerces the child.  His point is that through love and attachment the  <br/>\nchild naturally wants to follow the parent - it cannot be forced.
