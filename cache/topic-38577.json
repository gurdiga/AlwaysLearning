I can&#39;t even think of anywhere in the Bible (if religion<br/>\nhad a part to play) were this is advocated. In fact, being religious,<br/>\nI honestly believe that the part where Jesus told the disciples to<br/>\nback off and let the little tikes approach him shows he WAS supportive<br/>\nof children, much like he was actually supportive of women, even<br/>\nthough the men of the time treated them like property. (the whole<br/>\nstone throwing incident with the men who accused the adulteress but<br/>\nsomehow left the adulterer out of it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it&#39;s a huge mindset to change from thinking, &quot;But they&#39;re<br/>\nkids, they don&#39;t deserve to have the same rights as adults.

While my older ones DO go near the road, with my<br/>\nwatchful eye, and a few times I HAVE had to remind them that cars are<br/>\ncoming...but they are very good at staying on the side now and handle<br/>\nit quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; And then I thought of parents I know whose kids bite or hit other<br/>\n&gt; kids, and I wondered how you all would handle that if it were YOUR<br/>\n&gt; child...<br/>\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; When Simon or Linnaea are getting angry toward each other, or are<br/>\n </span></blockquote>having a day that is more emotional than usual I tend to be fairly<br/>\nconstantly present. I also make sure that I offer lots of distractions<br/>\nand food and drink over the course of the day. Sometimes being<br/>\nfrustrated comes from being hungry or tired or sick or bored (as<br/>\nLinnaea has told me, she has added Bored to the HALT acronym (Hungry<br/>\nAngry Lonely Tired)). And if I&#39;m around I can keep things from getting<br/>\nto the breaking point and if they do break, I can take the hit while<br/>\nprotecting the other person.

And he felt attacked when we talked about it - or bored.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe slowly caught on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the midst of something, you can use some pre-thought-out phrases to  <br/>\nuse that might help him see what you&#39;re trying to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you&#39;re all sitting around the living room - he&#39;s watching Monday  <br/>\nnight football, kids are building with legos on the floor. They jump  <br/>\nup to do something else, paint pictures, let&#39;s say, and leave a big  <br/>\nbunch of legos scattered around the floor, right in his line of vision  <br/>\nbetween him and the tv &lt;G&gt;. He yells after then, &quot;Hey, come back and  <br/>\nclean these up before you go off and make another mess somewhere  <br/>\nelse.&quot; You deftly step in and start cleaning them up, with a big smile  <br/>\nand a positive attitude. And you say, &quot;Hey you guys, let&#39;s first get  <br/>\nthese ready for the next time you want to use them and then I&#39;ll help  <br/>\nyou get all the paint out in the kitchen.&quot; In the meantime, you&#39;ve  <br/>\nprobably already almost finished putting them away, so there really  <br/>\nisn&#39;t much for the kids to do. Everybody is happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis worked wonders at my house - my husband got to see how to ask the  <br/>\nkids to do something without creating a power struggle, which is how  <br/>\nhis usual demands nearly always ended up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe noticed that I asked for much less but got cooperation when I  <br/>\nasked. He demanded and got resistance and anger. At first he blamed me  <br/>\nfor the resistance he experienced because &quot;I&quot; didn&#39;t make them do  <br/>\nenough. He was right, in a way. Because of the way I was treating  <br/>\nthem, they weren&#39;t willing to accept the way he was treating them. So  <br/>\nhe was a bit resentful and stopped asking them to do things. Then he  <br/>\nstarted asking me to ask them to do things &lt;G&gt;. When he did that, I  <br/>\nwould usually ask the kids to help me, but be okay doing it myself if  <br/>\nthey didn&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in a while my husband will say, &quot;Don&#39;t do it FOR them, they need  <br/>\nto learn to clean up after themselves.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he says that in front of the kids, my response is, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s  <br/>\nokay, I don&#39;t mind at all because I&#39;m glad that in this family we all  <br/>\nhelp each other out in so many ways.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he says it to me privately, I tell him that that I&#39;m more concerned  <br/>\nwith long-term goals than with who cleans up the legos right now and  <br/>\nthat, long term, the kids will become more helpful people if they  <br/>\nexperience us being helpful to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat theme of looking at longer-term goals seemed to really make the  <br/>\nmost sense to him of anything else I tried in the way of explanation.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband certainly noticed that my interactions with the kids were  <br/>\nmore harmonious than his. He also noticed, though, that I &quot;waited on  <br/>\nthem&quot; a lot, whereas he felt like kids should be asked to &quot;wait on&quot;  <br/>\nadults more often than not. That comes from his childhood in Iran  <br/>\nwhere kids were pretty much treated like little servants. He couldn&#39;t  <br/>\nwait to be a grown-up so that he could be the one giving orders. So  <br/>\nthat feels like a sort of dirty trick was played on him - he doesn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to feel like a servant to his kids now that he&#39;s the grown up. It  <br/>\ntook a while and still he sometimes feels like we parents are going  <br/>\ntoo far, doing too much for the kids, not asking enough of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can help a relationship a lot if you realize that he is not you, he  <br/>\nisn&#39;t going to ever BE you. His relationship with the kids belongs to  <br/>\nthem, not to you. Even though my husband was never totally on board  <br/>\nwith certain things - he came slowly around to far more respectful  <br/>\nparenting than he probably ever thought he would. He DID emulate me at  <br/>\ntimes. And every once in a while I&#39;d give him a concrete suggestion -  <br/>\nto make things better, not to make him a perfect imitation of me &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>\nFor example, one idea I got from the &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen  <br/>\nand Listen so Kids Will Talk&quot; book, was &quot;use a word.&quot; I thought that  <br/>\nwould really help him. I told him about it and he immediately tried it  <br/>\nout. Roya walked by with a wet towel and draped it over the back of  <br/>\nthe couch while she talked to us. Then she walked off, leaving it  <br/>\nthere. My husband&#39;s cue to launch into a lecture about why she  <br/>\nshouldn&#39;t leave wet towels on the furniture and her to get huffy about  <br/>\nbeing lectured at and him angry at the way she talked back to him and  <br/>\nher grabbing the towel, angrily, and flinging it into the bathroom and  <br/>\nslamming her bedroom door. Over a wet towel on the back of the couch?  <br/>\nI could see it coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this time he just very nicely said, &quot;Towel,&quot; and Roya turned  <br/>\naround, smiled and said, &quot;Oh, thanks,&quot; and took it off with her. My  <br/>\nhusband about fell out of his chair. My credibility went up about a  <br/>\nthousand percent right then and there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the kids adore him and know what a wonderful and sweet heart he  <br/>\nhas and they find some of his &quot;old country&quot; beliefs and behaviors   <br/>\nvery charming, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Thank You, and What About Dad?","postDate":"1222278240","msgId":38628,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNhOTNmZmYxMDgwOTI0MTA0NG83M2JjODQ4N29kNjE3MmYzYjEzNzEwMDZjQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc0MTkyMEJDLUYxRUEtNDY0MC04QjlFLTg3Q0ZCRjlENjMxQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGQwYi4zNGMyMTMyNC4zNjBiYTM1N0Bhb2wuY29tPgkgPDc0MTkyMEJDLUYxRUEtNDY0MC04QjlFLTg3Q0ZCRjlENjMxQUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":38627,"nextInTopic":38631,"prevInTime":38627,"nextInTime":38629,"topicId":38577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Both as a child and adult, I think being an unschooled child could have prevented me from having a need to do stupid silly things to rebel. ~Katherine ...

But I&#39;d ask....**<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, no. :) Connected parenting isn&#39;t going to guarantee that your kid won&#39;t <br/>\never do something thoughtless, or careless, or even incredibly dangerous. <br/>\nAbout the only thing you can say for sure is that it&#39;s unlikely a child will be <br/>\ndoing any particular something out of a need to rebel or fight back against the <br/>\nparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when the kid blows it IS the point. It helps to think about what <br/>\nkinds of reactions would help *you* in the aftermath of a situation where you <br/>\nhad done something that turned out badly. I&#39;ve had the opportunity to think <br/>\non this a lot recently, after attempting to drive my van through standing water <br/>\nin a flooded parking lot that turned out to be *much* deeper than it looked. <br/>\nThe engine was destroyed, and because there was a LOT of water everywhere in <br/>\nthe area that weekend, the insurance company is being slower than normal to do <br/>\neverything, including deciding that my beloved 11yo van isn&#39;t worth much at <br/>\nall. :( <br/>\n<br/>\nA really poor decision of mine has had big effects on the whole family. My <br/>\nhusband has been taking the train to work so the rest of us can use his car. He <br/>\nhas to wake up earlier, walk a mile to the station, walk nearly two miles to <br/>\nwork from the other station. He gets home later than usual. Some of the things <br/>\nour kids wanted to do have had to be rescheduled or cancelled because we just <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t figure out a way to get everyone where they wanted to be. We&#39;re going <br/>\nto have to spend a lot of money for another vehicle, when we had thought we&#39;d <br/>\nhave a few years yet before we&#39;d replace the van - it was in outstanding <br/>\nshape right up until I ran it into the water, and I&#39;d just had new tires put on it <br/>\nin May. We&#39;re having a lot of trouble finding the time to go out looking at <br/>\nvehicles without feeling the pressure to just make a decision right now. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been feeling sad and mad at myself and pretty dumb, but I&#39;ve also been <br/>\nfeeling SO incredibly loved because not one member of my family has been <br/>\nanything but supportive. Nobody has asked how I could do something so stupid or what <br/>\nwas I thinking. Nobody has pointed out exactly where I went wrong and what I <br/>\nshould do in the future. Nobody has complained about how they&#39;ve been <br/>\ninconvienced or about how much this is going to cost us. Nobody has made jokes at my <br/>\nexpense. My husband has hugged me and told me that it will work out okay, that <br/>\nhe&#39;s happy because nobody got hurt or was ever in danger. He&#39;s also gently <br/>\nreminded me of things I need to do to help us work out of this situation without <br/>\nimplying I was stupid or thoughtless because I hadn&#39;t remembered all of them <br/>\nmyself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s the kind of reaction our kids need when they blow it. Help and support <br/>\nto think through what needs to be done. Hugs and appreciation that they are <br/>\nstill around for us to love. Support in fixing what needs to be fixed, or <br/>\nmourning what can&#39;t be repaired. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s SO easy to get derailed. The parent feels compelled to point out how <br/>\nstupid the kid was and how lucky they are to be alive. The kid feels compelled to <br/>\nprotect himself by deflecting the criticism, protesting that he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nunderstand what the big deal is or yelling in response. Everybody ends up hurt, <br/>\nfeeling angry and misunderstood. Whatever might have been learned from the <br/>\nexperience ends up buried under layers of blame and resentment. It doesn&#39;t have to <br/>\nbe that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************<br/>\nLooking for simple solutions to your real-life <br/>\nfinancial challenges?

So when the kids do<br/>\nsomething that is very normal for kids, he&#39;ll react in a very &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\nparent-type way. Sometimes I do, too. But when I catch myself, he&#39;ll<br/>\nof course still be reacting the same way. <br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDavid parents in a different way to me. Sometimes it is lecturing, sometimes it is playing, it&#39;s just different. Sometimes there are things that I can see are being made more difficult because of the way he handles it. But there is definitely a vice versa going on sometimes. Today, for example, Simon said he was tired and I asked him a couple of times if he wanted a bath. David turned to me and gently said &quot;He knows what he wants, he is very good at asking for what he wants.&quot; HIs perspective often helps me to see more clearly. If David is being angrier or shorter, more terse, with Simon and Linnaea I&#39;ll sometimes ask if he&#39;s tired, not meanly, not naggingly, just as a sort of nudge. Usually he is tired. Maybe he&#39;s always tired, but in that moment he gets to choose whether or not to be led by being tired. But that comes from lots of time into this kind of parenting. Sometimes I&#39;ll change what is going on with Simon and Linnaea, move us into a different<br/>\n activity, a different kind of motion and noise. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early days I&#39;m sure I told him off more. I don&#39;t think it helped. It just made him more defensive and less likely to be involved. Now, if I see something that I know is going to piss him off happening I will try and step in, just as I would with Simon or Linnaea, and mediate that moment, calm it, make it less irritating. I think he does the same thing. That didn&#39;t happen because I nagged him. That didn&#39;t happen because I told him what to do. It came because I wanted things to be better and brighter and more peaceful (if loud) and I took steps to make that happen. David wanted the same thing and he saw what I had done and did similar things. There have been conversations, I talk a lot, but it has been much more about modelling than it has been about sculpting, if you will. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nI think I&#39;m hitting on some key elements that finally clicked for me<br/>\ntonight, as I was trying to explain some stuff to him, and then he<br/>\nasked me, &quot;Well, what happens when the kid goes off and does something<br/>\nreally stupid, then?&quot; I replied that, I THINK, the whole point is that<br/>\nin respectful families, the kids have NO NEED to do anything stupid.<br/>\nBut I&#39;d ask....<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if you did something really stupid, what would you want to happen. What if you broke a dish or got distracted while you were creating something and glued a piece of paper to the floor? What would you want to have happen? Would you want to be lectured or grounded or made to replace the goods? Or would you want to have help cleaning up the mess and moving forward from that moment? People do stupid things, usually accidentally. It is best if you just help to minimize the costs of the stupidity and move on. I tend to feel pretty stupid after I&#39;ve done something stupid, having someone else tell me what an idiot I am just makes me angry and defensive and usually I shout back. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nAnd then I thought of parents I know whose kids bite or hit other<br/>\nkids, and I wondered how you all would handle that if it were YOUR<br/>\nchild...<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Simon or Linnaea are getting angry toward each other, or are having a day that is more emotional than usual I tend to be fairly constantly present. I also make sure that I offer lots of distractions and food and drink over the course of the day. Sometimes being frustrated comes from being hungry or tired or sick or bored (as Linnaea has told me, she has added Bored to the HALT acronym (Hungry Angry Lonely Tired)). And if I&#39;m around I can keep things from getting to the breaking point and if they do break, I can take the hit while protecting the other person. If I had a child who was likely to go from happy to hitting quickly I would be present a lot of the time. When Linnaea was younger that was really important. I don&#39;t think they need to work through those things alone. I am very present when there is a disagreement over things or time or whatever going on. They are both good at coming up with alternatives, but if they are in the middle of being<br/>\n angry and resentful and furious it is really hard to calm down enough to think of another way. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\nAnd the part (don&#39;t remember if Sandra or someone she was quoting said<br/>\nit) about LETTING yourself (as an adult) process your feelings instead<br/>\nof trying to STOP the anger, to let it come, realize why it&#39;s there,<br/>\nthen let it go, might actually help HIM personally. He is a person who<br/>\nreacts before he thinks sometimes, and never hurts people, but usually<br/>\nsays things he doesn&#39;t mean, or throws his tools or something. And he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to do it, but doesn&#39;t know how to stop. So maybe this<br/>\nwill help him!<br/>\n&lt;snip&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I have that kind of anger. Less now. But I have broken a few things in my time. It is an awful thing to not know what to do with being angry. I&#39;m really good at saying mean things. Maybe you could talk about that with him. Not to tell him how to be better in his own self, but how his angry overwhelms him and he&#39;s an adult. Maybe suggest that if you can be there for your children more and be more present when they are working through something that they won&#39;t end up with the anger that plays out in those hugely explosive and scary and hurtful ways. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Thank You, and What About Dad?","postDate":"1222259052","msgId":38609,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ2QzdGMUFELUQxRjgtNDMzRC05QjVFLUZGRTE5MjcxRjE3NkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4ZDljNjI0LjFlMDE4ZTBhLjAzY2IuM2I2NEBteC5nb29nbGUuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdiY2NzcytiZHFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NDhkOWM2MjQuMWUwMThlMGEuMDNjYi4zYjY0QG14Lmdvb2dsZS5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":38597,"nextInTopic":38613,"prevInTime":38608,"nextInTime":38610,"topicId":38577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I don t consider it forced schooling since 1. she s gifted (no doubt about that) and...-=- Put the brakes on, please.

I changed clothes  <br/>\nand took Kirby to the doctor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was glad to tell Keith, when he got home, that I had handled a  <br/>\ndisaster calmly.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday was a rough day for me, just one thing after another,  <br/>\nstarting with waking up to a computer that wouldn&#39;t power on, and no  <br/>\ntrick I&#39;d known before (plugging and unplugging, waiting) helped.   <br/>\nBlack was black.  It didn&#39;t even smell like Johnson&#39;s baby soap or  <br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was important that I not add to the unfolding day of  <br/>\nimperfection by being horrible myself.  I was short a few times, but  <br/>\ntried to turn it to humor and apology and try to act in ways that let  <br/>\nmy friends and family know that it was a bad day that a long nap  <br/>\nwould fix, but for one reason and another I couldn&#39;t take a nap yet,  <br/>\nbecause the problems were still arriving and unfolding themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you model your newfound attempt to be and reasons to be more  <br/>\nmindful and calm, it will spread.

I do not consider myself an unschooler YET, but I&#39;m slowly <br/>\ntravelling down that path.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, my husband is Egyptian and comes from a culture where <br/>\nhomeschooling is virtually non-existent and almost guaranteed to lead <br/>\nto a life of unemployment and poverty. I&#39;ve wanted to homeschool my <br/>\nchildren since my first marriage over ten years ago. When I <br/>\nremarried, I set right to work at showing Hesham (I guess DH is <br/>\neasier in this case, LOL) the virtues of homeschooling. I hammered it <br/>\ninto him at every opportunity. After three years, our first daughter <br/>\nwas born and now that she&#39;s going to turn four, he wouldn&#39;t have it <br/>\nany other way (SCORE!)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for unschooling. Right now, I&#39;m using Calvert K with DD. I don&#39;t <br/>\nconsider it forced schooling since 1. she&#39;s gifted (no doubt about <br/>\nthat) and 2, she LOVES doing the work. She begs to do it and if I <br/>\ncan&#39;t one day, she&#39;ll ask about it all day. I plan on finishing off <br/>\nthe curriculum, then go more towards interest-lead learning in the <br/>\nform of unit studies (informally). I plan on using a curriculum for <br/>\nmath however. It&#39;s taken so much work trying to get DH convinced that <br/>\nhomeschooling is not only the best way, but the only way. I don&#39;t <br/>\nwant to push it with him. I can justify unschooling with the rest of <br/>\nher education, but I feel like I&#39;d lose his support when it comes to <br/>\nmath. Secondly, I have medical conditions that might make it <br/>\nimpossible to follow her closely (and my other daughter, for that <br/>\nmatter) in the future. Should the case ever arise that (God forbid) <br/>\nI&#39;m no longer around, I want her to be able to take up learning under <br/>\nsomeone else&#39;s tutelage or a school (again, God forbid) without too <br/>\nmuch grief. This is the one area I know she might lack otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know many of you will have your opinions on this and I welcome <br/>\nthem. I&#39;d like to fully unschool her, but I also need to resolve it <br/>\nwith my life&#39;s circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for the rambling!<br/>\n<br/>\nLaura<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;What has the journey of your spouse or partner looked like as you have<br/>\n&gt;traveled the unschooling path?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t let school get in the way of your education!&quot; --unknown<br/>\nVisit  Practical Homeschooling and view our September contest for a <br/>\nchance to win free paint-me puzzles!<br/>\nPractical Homeschooling: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.practical-homeschooling.org\">http://www.practical-homeschooling.org</a><br/>\nWorks in Progress: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/Laura.Beaudin\">http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/Laura.Beaudin</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":356893003,"authorName":"prism7513","from":"&quot;prism7513&quot; &lt;penley75@...&gt;","profile":"prism7513","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Thank You, and What About Dad?","postDate":"1222227676","msgId":38577,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdiY2NzcytiZHFkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":38587,"prevInTime":38576,"nextInTime":38578,"topicId":38577,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"First off I want to thank Sandra for her website (thank you, Sandra!)

I will admit that having<br/>\nnow met you in &quot;person&quot; on-line, I was a bit nervous and excited (THE<br/>\nSandra Dodd????) I had heard about your site from other unschooler<br/>\nforums, but somehow never got the link to any you were on until the<br/>\nNING site where your name appeared and I went &quot;Hey - I know that name!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I will say I feel somewhat less educated compared to you (I<br/>\nwould use the &quot;s&quot; word, but since I know how you feel about that now,<br/>\nI&#39;ll refrain!) I hope that someday I&#39;ll feel as confidant as you sound<br/>\nin your posts. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis whole concept of changing the way we think in order to change the<br/>\nway we parent and allow our children the freedom to be and learn is<br/>\nstill a process I&#39;m growing through.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s ironic. When I was little, my mom didn&#39;t like us saying those<br/>\nsilly children&#39;s clapping rhymes because she said words are powerful<br/>\nand the ones we were saying were not good (Mama, Mama, I&#39;m so sick,<br/>\ncall the doctor quick quick quick...Doctor, doctor, will I die? Count<br/>\nto five and you&#39;ll be alive!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet here I am, fully adult, and once again finding out how<br/>\npowerful words can be, though obviously in a different fashion. And to<br/>\nbe honest, I will admit my first knee-jerk reaction is: this is not<br/>\nfun. Now I have to THINK before I can just say what I want!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hopefully I&#39;ll get over it and just learn!<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, to everyone:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has the journey of your spouse or partner looked like as you have<br/>\ntraveled the unschooling path?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy DH is very supportive of it (remember, he&#39;s a public school social<br/>\nstudies teacher, mostly seniors, and a head football coach.) He hasn&#39;t<br/>\nread any of the books (not a book reader) or gone to any of the sites,<br/>\ndue to time. So I just relay the info I find to him, and he totally<br/>\nagrees with me, which is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then comes the parenting stuff, which I&#39;m not totally great at,<br/>\nyet. I try very hard to guide my children peacefully, and I know I do<br/>\nbetter than I would have if I had never heard of unschooling. But I<br/>\nhave a long way to go. <br/>\n<br/>\nDH (Jim, it&#39;s easier) doesn&#39;t get the benefit of sitting down 3 hours<br/>\na night to read all the stuff I do, and he isn&#39;t here during the day<br/>\nto see how I might react in certain situations. So when the kids do<br/>\nsomething that is very normal for kids, he&#39;ll react in a very &quot;normal&quot;<br/>\nparent-type way. Sometimes I do, too. But when I catch myself, he&#39;ll<br/>\nof course still be reacting the same way. And I don&#39;t want to chide<br/>\nhim, because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s any better than putting down the<br/>\nchild, but I&#39;m not sure how to explain to him all the stuff I&#39;ve<br/>\ngathered in the short time that we actually get to talk (over the kids<br/>\nchatter, of course, since he&#39;s only home for a few hours before HE<br/>\ngoes to bed around 8 or 9...getting up at 5 to get work done at school<br/>\nbefore his football boys come in for their morning weight lift.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall he&#39;s a GREAT father, and wonderful husband. I count my<br/>\nblessings daily! And since I&#39;m still working on MY end of the<br/>\nparenting scale, I can&#39;t expect him to be perfect. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what did you all do, or DO you do? Did you dh&#39;s or partners read<br/>\neverything you did? Or do you sit down and talk about it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m hitting on some key elements that finally clicked for me<br/>\ntonight, as I was trying to explain some stuff to him, and then he<br/>\nasked me, &quot;Well, what happens when the kid goes off and does something<br/>\nreally stupid, then?&quot; I replied that, I THINK, the whole point is that<br/>\nin respectful families, the kids have NO NEED to do anything stupid.<br/>\nBut I&#39;d ask....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I thought of parents I know whose kids bite or hit other<br/>\nkids, and I wondered how you all would handle that if it were YOUR<br/>\nchild...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I read Sandra&#39;s site on sibling fights, and I think I found<br/>\nan answer, sort of...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s maybe not a certain way of handling it, but it&#39;s about looking<br/>\nat how your child would WANT you to handle it (not in the silly,<br/>\ndoubter&#39;s head sort of way where one might think, &quot;well, he&#39;s a kid,<br/>\nhe&#39;ll want to get away with it!&quot;) because I&#39;m beginning to see that&#39;s<br/>\nnot true. He WANTS to do good, and doesn&#39;t know how to handle the<br/>\nfeelings he has, and he needs MY help to figure out a way to properly<br/>\nhandle those strong, and justified, feelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the part (don&#39;t remember if Sandra or someone she was quoting said<br/>\nit) about LETTING yourself (as an adult) process your feelings instead<br/>\nof trying to STOP the anger, to let it come, realize why it&#39;s there,<br/>\nthen let it go, might actually help HIM personally. He is a person who<br/>\nreacts before he thinks sometimes, and never hurts people, but usually<br/>\nsays things he doesn&#39;t mean, or throws his tools or something. And he<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t like to do it, but doesn&#39;t know how to stop. So maybe this<br/>\nwill help him!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you again, and any advice you have for Dad would be wonderful!<br/>\n<br/>\nDeb</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":38911,"nextTopicId":38578}}
