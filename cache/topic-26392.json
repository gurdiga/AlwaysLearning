I  <br/>\nbagged groceries for quite awhile as a teen.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThird place.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey went in pairs and he was last of an odd number so he got to pick  <br/>\nwho he bagged against as the bye.  He chose the regional manager, who  <br/>\nbeat him on time, but just by throwing the stuff in the bags however  <br/>\n(because he wasn&#39;t really in the contest) which gave the judge a good  <br/>\nopportunity for a dramatic double-take of fear when she looked in.   <br/>\nBut Marty fumbled the bar of soap, and then when he got it in the  <br/>\nlittle bag, he dropped that.  So there went several seconds.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m glad we went, and we weren&#39;t at all the only people in costume!   <br/>\nThere were lots and lots.  The theme was &quot;Knights in Shining Armor,&quot;  <br/>\nand the people from Marty&#39;s store had shields that said Marty and  <br/>\n813, and there were photos of Marty in armor (two real and one  <br/>\nphotoshop).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bad thing was it was run as a crazed pep rally with tons of  <br/>\npeople screaming, and one store had brought a drum (snare drum and  <br/>\ndrummer), and some had air horns, and lots of people were whistling  <br/>\nand screaming, and they dragged the whole thing out to nearly two  <br/>\nhours.  It was pretty painful, but most of the people there were  <br/>\nreally happy.  It reminded me of a high school pep rally in a small  <br/>\ngym, in all the worst ways, but I didn&#39;t even have bleachers to sit  <br/>\non.   It was Holly&#39;s first experience with that level of human frenzy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel sorry for the people who had come in tonight just to get some  <br/>\ngroceries and happened in on all that.  It&#39;s a big store, but there  <br/>\nwere four lanes open and four occupied by this wild party with  <br/>\nplacards and banners and plastic swords and kids dressed as fairy  <br/>\nprincesses and pirates and dragons and adults dressed as knights and  <br/>\nmonks and roman soldiers and cousins of Orcs and there was a DJ  <br/>\nplaying unexpected things for each paired race�radically different  <br/>\nstuff.

Sometimes we couldn&#39;t even tell what the music was  <br/>\nfor all the screaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Marty got home he told us stories of what we had missed or  <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t know, and he was still totally adrenalated, so he walked up  <br/>\nto the store to tell those who were working tonight how the contest  <br/>\nwent, and that let him walk off and discharge some of his energy so  <br/>\nhe could fall asleep and get up at 5:30 to go to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got a medallion that says Honorable Mention, and a $5 gift card  <br/>\n(for having answered a trivia question). There were trophies for 2nd  <br/>\nand 1st.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral of the people from his store thanked us for being supportive  <br/>\nof the whole crazy thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they introduced him they didn&#39;t say he was homeschooled.  That&#39;s  <br/>\nokay.  All I heard of the introduction, over the noise, was that he  <br/>\nwas planning to become a police officer someday.  I didn&#39;t know that  <br/>\nwas still the current plan.  Keith doesn&#39;t love that plan.  I asked  <br/>\nhim later what else he said.  He said he couldn&#39;t even hear so well  <br/>\nhimself, but they said he&#39;d been working there since December and  <br/>\nthat he was a really nice guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":227139139,"authorName":"elizabeth roberts","from":"elizabeth roberts &lt;joyfullzoo@...&gt;","profile":"joyfullzoo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Marty in the chain mail...","postDate":"1154046423","msgId":26393,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwNzI4MDAyNzAzLjY2MDk4LnFtYWlsQHdlYjUyMDA5Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5Njc2Qjk2LUVCNjgtNDlDMC1CMUY5LUVFRTJFNTJFQ0Q0RUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26392,"nextInTopic":26401,"prevInTime":26392,"nextInTime":26394,"topicId":26392,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Cool!
