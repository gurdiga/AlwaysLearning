(Sometimes travel or lack of availability may intervenes but they understand that.) My kids are all slender and seem to have grown pretty well, all on their own &#39;plan.&#39; Emily, my 12 yo dd, notes that she seems to want to eat more away from home, such as at friends&#39; houses, and theorizes that it&#39;s because there seems so much control over the food that it seems a scarce commodity. I had not realized how far we&#39;d come down that road, how at variance we&#39;d become (from most families) until just last night (Halloween).  We had friends over, another hs&#39;ing family (they do school at home but aren&#39;t critical of us). They have 4 very active boys, who eat<br/>\n very healthily; their mom sees to that!  She has controlled what they ate for years but is &#39;trying to loosen up.&#39;  Anyway I had ordered pizza to share on our front porch while we passed out candy.  The youngest child, age 7, is usually an amazingly voracious eater, but was just picking at his pizza unenthusiastically.  Without a thought I said, &quot;Mitchell, if you don&#39;t feel like pizza or carrots, there is a bucket-load of candy.&quot;  My friend burst out, &quot;Did you just say that!! What are you thinking!!&quot; She already knows my philosophy, so I just answered that it seemed natural to offer our guests what we have. And it is a special day, too, I added.  She couldn&#39;t really speak for a while!!   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":143043046,"authorName":"Ed Wendell","from":"&quot;Ed Wendell&quot; &lt;ewendell@...&gt;","profile":"zelco123","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Unfooding myself","postDate":"1256504426","msgId":48124,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEU2OTQ1MUI3MkQzNjQyQkM4RUVGNkJGMzNCMjZGNEI0QEVkUEM+","inReplyToHeader":"PDc2RTU3NTMwLUYwNjEtNDIzQi04MUI1LTM0QkFDQUVCRTdDN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhjMjYyYythZXZuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzZFNTc1MzAtRjA2MS00MjNCLTgxQjUtMzRCQUNBRUJFN0M3QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48123,"nextInTopic":48263,"prevInTime":48123,"nextInTime":48125,"topicId":48045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Zac is 15 and when he orders a soda at a restaurant the wait staff still looks at us and asks if that is OK?

I suspect that if your daughter is like most 17 month olds, she eats when she is hungry and does not when she is not.  If you provide your daughter with a variety of food choices--all kinds of foods from all kinds of food groups, she will have the opportunity to experiment with different flavors, textures, colors, etc. Eating habits are developed over periods of time and likely will change with the seasons, and over the years. If you provide your daughter with a variety of foods, and place no importance on one kind of food over another, she will likely be a healthy and adventurous eater (by adventurous I mean non-picky and able to be satisfied by the many food options out there.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I do still try to encourage her to eat the healthy portions.

She also quotes studies that show that when kids are offered a bribe or a reward for trying a new food, they are unlikely to want to try that particular food again, even with a bribe.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest trying to not consider any one sort of food &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; but just food, at least when it comes to how you speak about it to your daughter. In my house we keep sweets available at all times, along with a huge variety of other foods. I have found that my girls (ages 7 and 4) are quite self-regulating when it come to sweets.  They often go days without having any, and there might be times when they want sweets more frequently. Because we place no importance on sweets, they are just as likely to choose almonds or smoked oysters to eat as a bar of chocolate, it just depends upon their mood, the time of the day, the craving at the moment, or what they might have just read or seen someone else do! <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; However, I believe that in order to properly unfood, I should truly understand it.

I fed/nursed when my children wanted to eat.  When they were toddlers and seemed too busy playing to take time to eat, I put out finger foods to snack on throughout the day.  I kept food easy to reach on the lowest shelf in the pantry and the refrigerator.  Are you worried about eating too much yourself, or are you worried about your daughter?  I can&#39;t imagine a 17 month old scarfing down food because you put it out.  I think kids are better at eating when they are hungry than adults.  They don&#39;t have the hang-ups that some adults do, perhaps because their food was controlled when they were kids?<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have thought that in order to do this, I should go to the grocery<br/>\n&gt; store and just buy whatever looks good to me.

Is there anything she doesn&#39;t like?  My 11 yr. old hates green beans.  I can&#39;t imagine forcing her to eat them because I think they are good for her.  There are so many food choices!  Do you avoid buying cookies or similar sweets because they are bad for her?  I try to keep lots of different foods in the house and we stay within our grocery budget.  If my children ask for something special that is not in the house, we put it on our grocery list and pick it up on the next shopping trip.  We&#39;ve also been known to run to the store just to get something craved, like birthday cake for me.  :)<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I wonder if it is truly possible to completely rid myself of some<br/>\n&gt; of the bad habits/guilt/control I have toward food. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Well, you are beginning to face those attitudes.  That seems like a good place to start.  Ask yourself why you feel that way.  Was it the way you lived growing up?  This may be alot like examining unschooling when you are used to the schooled way of life.  It is not always easy, but it certainly is doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth M.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unfooding myself","postDate":"1256007911","msgId":48048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg1NDdDQzVBLTdDRDUtNEY3Mi05MzRDLTUzMzkxOThCNjQ0M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhiaWZkdSs2OWxhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhiaWZkdSs2OWxhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48046,"nextInTopic":48049,"prevInTime":48047,"nextInTime":48049,"topicId":48045,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Have you gone through a process of unfooding yourselves?
