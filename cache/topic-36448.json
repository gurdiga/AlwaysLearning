I have been having some rough days. My youngest (4 1/2, almost<br/>\n5) has become quite the &quot;dumper&quot; over the last couple weeks. She seems bored<br/>\nand I am working on helping her, but for a couple months some neighborhood<br/>\nkids were coming over everyday to play, but they haven&#39;t come in about 2<br/>\nweeks now. It seems like I am just not enough and my oldest doesn&#39;t want to<br/>\nplay much with her either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, right now we have puzzle peices from a huge US map scattered on the<br/>\nfloor, cotton balls, playing cards, flash cards, blankets, pillows, books<br/>\nand toys. It&#39;s overwhelming and the last couple days I feel like I am being<br/>\n&quot;walked all over&quot; because &quot;no one will help me pick it up&quot;. How martyr-y is<br/>\nthat?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, thank you Rebecca for posting what I needed to post myself and for all<br/>\nthe replies as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nAmanda<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hopescreations.blogspot.com/\">http://hopescreations.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/\">http://whatmykidstaughtme.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com/\">http://365daysofsparkle.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":36447,"nextTopicId":36366}}
