Second for all the great advice and encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know kids learn in spite of everything. I say that... knowing I also have to work on reprogramming my brain. I went to ps until 10th grade, then private school. (BTW anyone interested, it isn&#39;t a better choice) It is so hard to stop thinking the way I was taught. Even though I always homeschooled my kids.... ya know it&#39;s still there. I am working very hard on this. I think part of what concerns me so much is the requirements of the state. I love the whole concept of unschooling. I know our kids will get there when they get there, and when they feel like getting there. I have been reading all of your comments, and I see what you mean. I see it in my younger kids especially. I guess it&#39;s because I am more relaxed with them. My 4 yo ds is doing things that constantly amaze me, and I am just simply getting out of his way. He plays all the time and learns. I do see it. I am learning to trust it. Just today, he was playing with his legos (one of his favorite things to do) and he brought me &quot;his number&quot;, the number 4 he made out of legos. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how do the rest of you deal with state requirements? Do you try to find an evaluator who will be open to unschooling (and how do you do that), or do you find an umbrella school that will let your kids learn without requiring tests or evaluations and only require what they have to? I guess I am just wondering how the rest of you handle this obstacle to their freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all so much, you are all truly a blessing,<br/>\n<br/>\nRebecca<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"How do kids learn?","postDate":"1020190278","msgId":6561,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExOS4xMGQ2OTExNC4yYTAwMzg0NkBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6566,"prevInTime":6560,"nextInTime":6562,"topicId":6561,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/30/02 10:43:51 AM Central Daylight Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes:  By","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1887798588\">In a message dated 4/30/02 10:43:51 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; How does this happen?
