What happens when we leave them there, and what happens when we brush. Get a hold of the Colgate tablets that turn red or blue when there is still a bit of dirt in the mouth or teeth. It could be fun for the child to see if he/she can win the fight against the germs in the mouth. Make up a story each time, on how there are some meanies that are trying to attack the kingdom  inside the mouth. The teeth being the horses that the germs want to take over, and the toothbrush is the strongest knight, trying to push them away as the child is brushing, I mean there can be so many stories created, as the child is brushing, and going back to see if there is still any red or blue meanies left that need to be taken cared of.<br>\n\nMaking it fun and exciting for the child, works pretty much all the time.

There have been times when they don&#39;t really want to brush but they really want their sweet,  so all they do is gargle with listerine, I tnk explaining to them goes a looooong way.

She is 1.5, and the first of my three kids to want nothing to do with me brushing her teeth. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe was born with a severe tongue tie and was unable to nurse well (and couldn&#39;t take any bottles at all) and had two minor (but very traumatic) surgeries by the time she was six weeks old. She subsequently developed an oral aversion that made the early months scary for me (she would become resistant to anything near her mouth and refuse to eat), and taught me more about patience than I had realized possible. From early infancy, she would completely resist anyone coming near her mouth unless they asked first and were given &quot;permission&quot; (for example, a doctor wanting to look in her mouth. I would ask, if she resisted I would not let the doctor try). This was instrumental in allowing her to relax and trust again (and eventually to be able to eat solids without gagging and choking). <br/>\n<br/>\nShe got teeth quite early, and I attempted to clean her teeth as I had her brothers (with a finger brush) but she vehemently refused, and I didn&#39;t push. Once she showed interest in her brothers brushing their teeth (around 10 months) we got her her own toothbrush, and she began imitating them. I would ask every couple of weeks or so I I could help her (my sons still ask me to &quot;finish&quot; their brushing for them), and she almost always said no.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout a month ago, I allowed my fears to gain too much hold in my mind, and decided I needed to try to push harder to help her clean her teeth. After several days of asking and her refusing, I made a horrible mistake and tried to brush her teeth anyway. I went against my instinct, and I will regret it forever. She looked in my eyes and began to cry. I stopped immediately, but the damage was done. She cried hard in my arms, pointing at her mouth and the toothbrush, shaking her head no. I cried with her, told her I was so sorry, that it was wrong and that I shouldn&#39;t have done it. After she calmed down and nursed, we played a game that my kids have all loved that has served as a strong counter to feelings of powerlessness: I get down on the floor and let her knock me over, again and again, exclaiming wildly while she jumped, bounced and climbed all over me while I was on the ground. I made an effort to play this game with her whenever she asked over the next week, and I did not ask to brush her teeth again. She continued to ask for her toothbrush (she loves the toothpaste!) when her brothers were brushing her teeth, and I began to sing more silly songs when helping her brothers with their teeth, which she always laughed at. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter about a week, it occurred to me that it might be very helpful for her to see me brushing my teeth more (instead of after she went to bed, which was the usual), so I got out my toothbrush and brushed with the boys. I sat down with her and asked if she could help me, and she loved it! It really reminded me how vulnerable it feels to have someone else sticking something in my mouth; it was hard to relax! She kept handing the brush back to me, watching how I brushed, and taking it back to do it again. When we were done, I thanked her, and told her that I appreciate her helping me keep my teeth clean and healthy. We did this for several more days, and one night she handed me her toothbrush and opened her mouth! I gently brushed two teeth, singing a song, and she took it back and smiled, brushing herself. Every time since then, she has asked for my &quot;help&quot; brushing, sometimes wanting me to brush all of her teeth, sometimes not, and it feels just right. Sometimes she goes around the whole house, asking brothers, dad, auntie and Grampa to take turns brushing. I know that my attitude around the brushing has shifted so much, and there is not way that I would have felt safe with someone putting something in my mouth if they held as much anxiety about it as I had been.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] cleaning teeth","postDate":"1389111682","msgId":73186,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxhaDloaCs0N2hkbmpAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBTUhjZEtVenJaZ0U3VkxTTTVjR0pqa2hTd2cxTnhhVVNHS0I9YXN1dEE0VlJEYk52Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxhZHZnMytnMmJya3VAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPgk8Q0FNSGNkS1dnVUVLSmlfTURzK2JlK0ZqV01wUzF1MUpUb0ZhYUNrd1gwTmg4cFE9Qmp3QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgk8bGFlaWRrK2NubTZ2aEBZYWhvb0dyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxDQU1IY2RLVXpyWmdFN1ZMU001Y0dKamtoU3dnMU54YVVTR0tCPWFzdXRBNFZSRGJOdmdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":73180,"nextInTopic":73187,"prevInTime":73185,"nextInTime":73187,"topicId":73153,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Helping kids promptly in the ways they want to be helped (immediate help, not &quot;you&#39;ll thank me when you&#39;re older&quot;) actually sets them up to learn about grace and thoughtfulness, patience and care because they&#39;re not in the position of feeling like they need to clamor to get what they need.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">When support is denied to teach some lesson or other, what is actually learned will have more to do with the child&#39;s perception than the parent&#39;s goals.

Some learn that it&#39;s important to be powerful so that you can be the bully. Some learn that it&#39;s important to maximize their helplessness - either as a way to gain a protector or as a way to punish the person who is bullying them. Personally, having experienced &quot;if you don&#39;t do X you won&#39;t eat&quot; as a child, I learned to be passive aggressive. I learned to comply but make life harder for other people in retribution. </p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><br></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">\n&gt;&gt;<span style=\"font-size:13px;\">my ASC son has real problems with me giving him direct instructions so I try and be very hands off&lt;&lt;<br><br>But you&#39;re still heavily invested in the idea that there are things he Has To Learn - that&#39;s something that&#39;s often even harder for parents of atypical kids because there&#39;s the tendency to panic and think they&#39;ll Never learn what they need to know unless they&#39;re pushed. And by that very assumption, you deny a portion of your child&#39;s humanity. <br>\n<br>One of the most fundamental principles of unschooling is that kids are curious about the world. All kids. Kids with cerebral palsy. Kids with autism. Kids with severe anxiety. Kids want to know, want to discover, want to explore and investigate. Sometimes they&#39;re bad at it - they&#39;re not as capable, have big, big issues in the way of being able to navigate the world, but they&#39;re still curious. They want to learn and they do learn. </span></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">One of the other fundamental principles of unschooling is that learning is tied to perception - so all learning always depends on the unique experience of the individual. That&#39;s Why teaching isn&#39;t learning and can never guarantee learning. Unschooling begins with the premise that you can&#39;t control what another person learns. You can force another person to act (sometimes) but in the process you change the context of learning so that it becomes tied up in perceptions of force and the personal and emotional responses to being forced. </span></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Conventional parenting accepts that force is a necessary part of human relationships - bigger, stronger people force smaller, weaker people to please them, and this is right and good. Arguably, it&#39;s natural. But it never guarantees learning - that&#39;s where unschooling gets radical, it&#39;s not about the ethics of force, but the nature of learning. Force doesn&#39;t create learning. </span></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">\n<span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Learning about the world is a grand endeavor. It&#39;s deep and convoluted. There are side shoots and backwaters, trails that go no-where but are still marvelous, connections that seem unimportant but later blossom in spectacular, unexpected ways. How do kids learn about teeth? The same way they learn about religion, or mud, or music, or reading. Something comes up and a connection is made, a trail is followed or disregarded, and life flows on. Along the way there&#39;s mythology and chemistry, birthday parties and trips to the grocery store. </span></p>\n<p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63,63,63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\">\n<span style=\"font-size:13px;\">One day my daughter spent four hours watching water flow over a creek bed.

And by that very assumption, you deny a portion of your child&#39;s humanity.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the most fundamental principles of unschooling is that kids are curious about the world. All kids. Kids with cerebral palsy. Kids with autism. Kids with severe anxiety. Kids want to know, want to discover, want to explore and investigate. Sometimes they&#39;re bad at it - they&#39;re not as capable, have big, big issues in the way of being able to navigate the world, but they&#39;re still curious. They want to learn and they do learn.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">One of the other fundamental principles of unschooling is that learning is tied to perception - so all learning always depends on the unique experience of the individual. That&#39;s Why teaching isn&#39;t learning and can never guarantee learning. Unschooling begins with the premise that you can&#39;t control what another person learns. You can force another person to act (sometimes) but in the process you change the context of learning so that it becomes tied up in perceptions of force and the personal and emotional responses to being forced.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Conventional parenting accepts that force is a necessary part of human relationships - bigger, stronger people force smaller, weaker people to please them, and this is right and good. Arguably, it&#39;s natural. But it never guarantees learning - that&#39;s where unschooling gets radical, it&#39;s not about the ethics of force, but the nature of learning. Force doesn&#39;t create learning.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Learning about the world is a grand endeavor. It&#39;s deep and convoluted. There are side shoots and backwaters, trails that go no-where but are still marvelous, connections that seem unimportant but later blossom in spectacular, unexpected ways. How do kids learn about teeth? The same way they learn about religion, or mud, or music, or reading. Something comes up and a connection is made, a trail is followed or disregarded, and life flows on. Along the way there&#39;s mythology and chemistry, birthday parties and trips to the grocery store.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"color:rgb(63, 63, 63);font-size:13.333333015441895px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, san-serif, Roboto;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">One day my daughter spent four hours watching water flow over a creek bed.

That&#39;s scary - and it leads some parents to do Insane things, like forced toothbrushing or refusing the child basic needs like food or sleep or parental affection. Things that if you suggested treating another adult that way would be considered cruelty. Those are panic moves - they don&#39;t do what parents think/hope they&#39;ll do.

There are lots of other options for oral hygiene, as well as the option of letting this one go, like shoes with no socks. If you brush your own teeth regularly, make it a chance to invite your child to do something with you, make it easy and light and fun, not a chore. If toothbrushing is a chore for you, think about that - you don&#39;t Have to brush your teeth. Explore some alternatives like rinses, wipes, tongue scrapers, cleansing foods. Read up on pH and the mineralization-demineralization cycle.

The purpose is to provide a point of view that can&#39;t be found on mainstream parenting advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I do hope you read the introductory emails that explains that *all* posts, whether initial questions or responses to questions, will be analyzed in light of radical unschooling ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I got the dentist to take photos of how to clean teeth with a proper model of teeth,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a good idea for learning anything. Being attentive and responsive to how your own child learns, can help lower frustration! :-) Still as an adult I appreciate a combination of pictures and words. If a child wants to learn something, it&#39;s helpful not to focus on the &quot;right&quot; way and to focus on how the child learns.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is also a great idea is being aware of when the *child* wants the information. Before a child is interested, parents can strew interesting posters, charts, pictures. Put them up for a while. Then replace them with something else. Don&#39;t make them all self improvement charts! Imagine the message your husband would be sending about his view and acceptance of you if he put up charts on How to Lose Weight, How to Eat Healthy, How to Cook Toast Properly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Once I stopped cleaning my sons teeth at about age 4,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Did he ask you to stop? If not, I&#39;m wondering why you stopped.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you think age 4 was &quot;old enough&quot;? Did you fear that if you kept brushing he&#39;d never learn himself? That you&#39;d have to accompany him to college to brush his teeth for him?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor radical unschooling to flourish, parents need to look at what their children are showing they&#39;re capable of rather than at charts, ages and advice from experts who&#39;ve never set eyes on your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren will show they&#39;re ready by doing. Humans are driven to become more competent. We want to do things ourselves. No child will go off to college still needing his mom to brush his teeth ... Unless she sends messages that he can&#39;t do it when he shows signs of wanting to! This video Drive by Daniel Pink explains it clearly:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I made sure that he followed the instructions but I rarely say anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>How do you &quot;make sure&quot; in a relationship building way? It&#39;s one of those weaselly phrases that sounds so gentle. But in practice, unless a child wants to do something -- in which case there&#39;s no need to &quot;make sure&quot; -- it often involves some harsh preparation to prevent the child from defying the mom&#39;s wishes. In many cases that preparation may have come months or years before on other things the mom wanted the child to do so the child knows if they protest the consequences will be harsh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is more relationship building is being with a child to support him in doing as much as he wants and to fill in for him where he can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;  He also uses a mouthwash so I&#39;m happy that he is doing a good job even though it may not be perfect every time.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have a simple rule in our house, no teeth cleaning means no food,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That makes it convenient for you. For a someone who can&#39;t find another home where the adults will feed him because they love him, it&#39;s cruel.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if your husband wanted the house tidier than you felt was necessary he could withhold access to the household money until you were performing to his standards. That sounds like a good idea, doesn&#39;t it? It sounds like a great way to build a loving, trusting partnership doesn&#39;t it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have explained the importance and my son knows that he has to clean his teeth,<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>As I wrote in Sandra&#39;s Unschooling Info forum on Facebook to a different issue, but the principles are the same,<br/>\n**********<br/>\nOne of the bigger relationship errors parents make is assuming that understanding is the same as being able to do. Then when a child does the wrong thing, the assumption is the child is deliberately choosing to be rude. Or lazy. Or defiant. (So the parent reprimands. And shames. And punishes.) Or somehow not understanding something so simple. (So the parent explains. And explains. And explains.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your child is being rude or defiant, there&#39;s something wrong in the relationship. (Or he&#39;s having a really hard time with his feelings.) He&#39;s feeling pushed around, not listened to, disconnected. Be more aware of how you&#39;re treating him. See his reactions as feedback on how well you&#39;re treating him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he&#39;s being &quot;lazy&quot; then you&#39;re expecting too much. He&#39;s not being lazy. He can&#39;t yet care in the way he needs to. Be what he needs to be. Create a pleasant atmosphere for him to grow in maturity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he isn&#39;t understanding when your explanation is clear, either he can&#39;t yet understand or something is in the way of him acting on his understanding. In either case, stop explaining. Help him notice. Ask him what might be in the way so you can get those things out of his way. Be what he needs to be until he can be it.<br/>\n**********<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we have had tantrums in the past over this but it does not usually l<br/>\n&gt; ast more than a few minutes - no breakfast is a strong motivator.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So if a husband wrote to a &quot;Be a better spouse&quot; forum about his wife, &quot;She got really upset in the past over this to the point of sobbing but it doesn&#39;t usually last more than a few minutes.
