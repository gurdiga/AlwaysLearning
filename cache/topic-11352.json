When Darin and I got married I told him that was <br/>\nwhat I was going to do and he didn&#39;t like it too much. I half joking half <br/>\nseriously asked him to take my name too. He refused. When Moly was born I <br/>\ntold him I really wanted the kids to have my name too and he refused again. <br/>\nSo I asked for a compromise that I give the kids the option to change their <br/>\nnames later if they wanted. I haven&#39;t given the kids that option yet, but <br/>\nmany times Moly has said that when she gets older she is going to add my name <br/>\nto hers and if she gets married she will keep her own and won&#39;t take his <br/>\nunless he takes hers! And she says she won&#39;t hyphenate his name because she <br/>\nalready has enough hyphens! &lt;g&gt; So she will be Moly-Elspeth Jaine Edds-Owens <br/>\nor Edds-Owens Smith or what ever his name is. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other day I received a notice to appear in court so I could testify in an <br/>\nanimal abuse, neglect, cruelty case against my neighbor. It reads to: Nancy <br/>\nSusan Edds AKA Nancy S. Edds-Owens AKA Nancy Susan Edds-Owens AKA Nancy S. <br/>\nOwens! Someone must be very confused at the court house, or they have been <br/>\ntalking to my therapist. &lt;veg&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nancy~ of the many names<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11349,"nextTopicId":11353}}
