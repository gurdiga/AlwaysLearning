In theory, children eventually honor those boundaries and <br/>\nlearn to set their own respectful boundaries with others.  Also, <br/>\nthey point out that parents cannot continue to &#39;rescue&#39; bad <br/>\nbehaviors (paying fines, etc.) or their children will learn to live <br/>\nin codependency throughout their lives.  Sometimes this stuff <br/>\nfeels &#39;unattached&#39; to me; not warm and fuzzy like I think of my own <br/>\nfamily feelings.    <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it is nice to know I have a &quot;right&quot; to a clean house!!!  I will <br/>\ninform my husband immediately as he is the worst culprit (not the <br/>\nfreakin kid)!!  lol  Now, can I call them?
