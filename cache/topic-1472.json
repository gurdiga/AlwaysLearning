I have it all somewhere, but not all<br/>\nin one place.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a copy on the wall here in my office.  <br/>\n<br/>\nit starts off &quot;Dear Sandra, <br/>\nWhen I called in this, my manager&#39;s office, a few<br/>\nmoments ago I was handed my very first American fan<br/>\nletter - and it was from you.  I was so pleased <br/>\nthat I had to sit down and type an immediate<br/>\nreply...&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow! I&#39;m a teensy bit envious.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It was 1967.  My friends would come over and say<br/>\n&quot;Yeah, but who IS he?&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI saw him in 1973 (or end of &#39;72?) and my friends were<br/>\nsaying the same thing. Nobody in my age group had<br/>\nheard of him.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It was weird, and interesting&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI still find a lot of his music weird and interesting<br/>\n(bar some of his eighties stuff - not my cup of tea).<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons I still have a &#39;crush&#39; on<br/>\nhim.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When he came to Santa Fe to film The Man Who Fell<br/>\nto Earth a couple of years later, my friends were<br/>\nsaying &quot;GO MEET HIM!&quot;  I didn&#39;t.  I was <br/>\nembarrassed or afraid he wouldn&#39;t remember me or<br/>\nsomething, and I didn&#39;t care as much then as I had<br/>\nbefore. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nOh no! I wouldn&#39;t have passed up that opportunity in a<br/>\nmillion years. But then again, I still care. <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The letter was sweet.  I had offered to start a<br/>\nfan club.  He said &quot;There is a Fan Club here in<br/>\nEngland, but if things go well in the States then <br/>\nwe&#39;ll have one there I suppose.  It&#39;s a little early<br/>\nto even think about it. &quot;I hope one day to get to<br/>\nAmerica.  my manager tells me lots about it as he <br/>\nhas been there many times with other acts he manages. <br/>\nI was watching an old film on TV the other night<br/>\ncalled &quot;No Down Payment&quot; a great film, but rather<br/>\ndepressing if it is a true reflection of The American<br/>\nWay of Life.  <br/>\nHowever, shortly after that they showed a documentary<br/>\nabout Robert Frost the American <br/>\npoet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that<br/>\nevened the score.  I am <br/>\nsure that that is nearer the real America...&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLOL!! He had no idea how mega huge he would be!<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I didn&#39;t buy any more of his albums, anyway--by<br/>\nthe time he was openly available I was immersed in<br/>\nfolk music.  I bought some current acoustic stuff<br/>\n(Elton John, Joni Mitchell, Carol King), but mostly I<br/>\nwas collecting field recordings of traditional stuff<br/>\nballads and everyday songs.  Then I got involved in<br/>\nRenaissance music, and I had a sexy, funny boyfriend<br/>\nfrom India and... one thing lead to another and here I<br/>\nam now hanging out with you guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve got most of his albums still - I had all of them<br/>\nbut the afformentioned half-sister stole some of them!<br/>\nI think Bowie is one of the main reasons I was<br/>\ninterested in going to England (not to meet him -<br/>\nalthough that would have been a bonus, but to check<br/>\nout the culture and the music!). Then I met my ex (a<br/>\nmusician, of course!), and stayed there for 12 years!<br/>\nFunny, where my &#39;crush&#39; led me &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeghan<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://greetings.yahoo.com\">http://greetings.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":1471,"nextTopicId":1474}}
