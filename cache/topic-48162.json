My husband works days and then we have about 1 1/2 - 2 hours together to eat and then I go off to work. We do have weekends together. My son sleeps in late and is more on my schedule than husband&#39;s. I am lucky because my husband is a playful guy and he spends a lot of time with our son in the evening, they play video games, watch lots of movies, have lots of discussions, etc. I try to help by leaving at least one thing for them to have to do most every time I&#39;m gone. Even if it&#39;s just something small, like last night I reminded them of a TV special that was coming on that they wanted to see. Sometimes I rent something for them but sometimes they go get their own stuff to do as well. We have been unschooling for more than 5 years now. My son is 11 and dropped out of kindergarten.  <br/>\n    Sometimes I get awful thoughts like &#39;wouldn&#39;t he be doing more school like stuff if I was at home full time&#39; or &#39;wouldn&#39;t he be smarter?&#39; Because I seem to work with him more on that (he turns to me for help with writing and spelling mostly but I&#39;m sure dh would help if asked.) But school like stuff is not what makes him the great person he is, and I think if he was in school he would have a totally different attitude, probably not as good as the one he has now. The skills schools value are emerging at their own pace but his experience is totally different. I think I would be being vain now to say that he would get a better education with just me, my dh is a great guy and I think the time my son spends with him is just as valuable as the time he spends with me. So what we&#39;re doing is working. I think it is a better choice than school for our son, but it probably isn&#39;t for everyone. I think if you put energy into making something work and the people involved are happy and also willing to do the work then you can still make a wonderful life even if it isn&#39;t a typical setup.

I&#39;m sure he&#39;s going to<br/>\ntry to involve the girls, so I&#39;ll hear some funny stories when I get home<br/>\ntonight.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago we bought a large freezer. When I cook I make a double batch<br/>\nand freeze one for the husband and girls when to eat when I&#39;m not home.<br/>\nThere&#39;s lots of online resources for this type of cooking or once-a-month<br/>\ncooking (which I also do sometimes). This week I&#39;ve been buying half bushels<br/>\nof b-grade apples (we live in an apple-growing area) and making and freezing<br/>\napplesauce for this winter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur home is near the center of a small town, and the girls can safely walk<br/>\nto the library, which they enjoy. We used to have an elderly couple<br/>\nimmediately next door that adored the girls and would check on them for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m at work, I&#39;m usually at a computer and all of us have gmail<br/>\naccounts.

In fact just recently, I&#39;ve been offered another side job where our kids are welcome to hang out too.

My kids are 13 and 12 years old and wonderful.~~<br/>\n<br/>\n I think exposing our children to our work can be ideal in many ways! It all depends. I&#39;ve worked full time for many years now and while I&#39;d really like to work less hours I can&#39;t see how school would improve our lives in any way. <br/>\n<br/>\nWorking from home could be a great way to be available to them and make an income! Can you flex your hours? I work retail so the lack of flexibility is frustrating at times....fortunately my dh can work around my schedule most of the time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":415623503,"authorName":"akorn1269","from":"&quot;akorn1269&quot; &lt;akorn1269@...&gt;","profile":"akorn1269","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Oh no!
