What finally made the difference for her was finding her passion.  She<br/>\nloves gymnastics and is definitely NOT built for it.  She is way, way too<br/>\ntall and leggy to make all that flipping around easy, but still she loves<br/>\nit.  She goes to meets knowing that she won&#39;t win, she takes extra classes<br/>\nso that she doesn&#39;t fall behind her friends who are more gifted in that<br/>\narea.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween stopping school and becoming self-motivated, she had models of her<br/>\nDad and I who have lots of interests and sometimes they come easy and<br/>\nsometimes they don&#39;t.  She saw us making decisions and prioritizing what we<br/>\nwanted to invest our time and selves into.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16355,"nextTopicId":16367}}
