We lived in a state, where regulations on homeschooling are just now starting to lighten up, so there was a lot of proof needed by local school districts. I did spend random years in school, for various reasons, but always ended up at home figuring out life. Then I went off to college, finding a major in my life passion (food science). <br><br>I was raised by people who were children through the depression, had lived through WWII, and had 8 children of their own. If being tough needed to apply anywhere, for me, that&#39;s it. Yet, my grandparents managed to raise two separate generations of people without fear, or punishment, or any other &quot;toughen them up&quot; conditioning that was mentioned.&nbsp;<br><br>We had many family friends through out the years that fell on both sides of this topic. I find that a lot of people who use words like &quot;wussy&quot; and &quot;toughen up&quot; are people who have a lot of trouble being at peace or being peaceful, in general. My grandpop was blinded in WWII and met his wife at a Philadelphia hospital, while recovering. They married and had all the kids, without him ever seeing a single freckle on his children&#39;s faces. You would think that would harden someone&#39;s heart forever, but the words I would use to describe that man are kind, caring, trusting, and overwhelmingly patient.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m convinced that &quot;generation&quot; has anything to do with it. For me it&#39;s about choice, choosing each day to smile or find happiness, even if the life around you is a little off it&#39;s balance. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":269399205,"authorName":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY","from":"BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;polykowholsteins@...&gt;","profile":"polykowholsteins","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: FURY and progress","postDate":"1424978713","msgId":75710,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0MzYyNjIxNi4xMzk3MDcuMTQyNDk3ODcxMzExMC5KYXZhTWFpbC55YWhvb0BtYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDUwRDZDRkNCLUNBMDgtNDA1Ri1CNUNELTU2M0UxNDJCOThFQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDUwRDZDRkNCLUNBMDgtNDA1Ri1CNUNELTU2M0UxNDJCOThFQkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":75709,"nextInTopic":75711,"prevInTime":75709,"nextInTime":75711,"topicId":75699,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Steve wrote this:  The world is made up of lots of people that care about a lot of other people.

It can make them cold to others&#39; suffering (as the commenter who said if people didn&#39;t like &quot;gee you&#39;re dumb&quot; that their kids would be wusses—I&#39;m paraphrasing, but I think that was his message), and in some cases (maybe many), give them the urge to pass that harm on, immediately or years later when there are children around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you search down for &quot;compassionate&quot; on this page, there are some stories:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/unexpected\">http://sandradodd.com/unexpected</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn looking for that link, I found another one.

It has helped me change unhelpful patterns and most of all helped me step into the *JOY* of life, connection, partnership with my children and husband. I know how scary it is to feel examined, and I think some other readers interpret examination as meanness, like I once did.

The lines of students were to try to whack the running student on the \nass with their belts. Dylan refused to play and when the instructor asked him \nwhy he told him it was disrespectful to his fellow students and to his dojo, \nuniform and belt.

It had hurt my feelings when I was younger, but still I passed it on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt started &quot;Look up.&quot; It ended, after a while with &quot;Gee, you&#39;re dumb.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reminded recently that I had told a relative NOT to teach my kids that fake &quot;game.&quot; I&#39;m still glad I asked that it not be done to them. The entirety of the rhyme, which has hand motions, was<br/>\n&quot;Look up. Look down.<br/>\nLook all around.<br/>\nLook at my thumb.<br/>\nGee, you&#39;re dumb.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI never wanted my kids to think for one joking moment that they were &quot;dumb.&quot; I always stopped at the &quot;look up&quot; part, and life has looked up for all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver three years later, someone wanted to leave all of the following, in public, on that blog:<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Butler has left a new comment on your post &quot;Look up&quot;: <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad used to do that to me when I was growing up and I thought it was hilarious. Me and my friends did it to each other and it never hurt anyone&#39;s &quot;feelings&quot;. In fact it was down right hilarious. It probably toughened us up so we weren&#39;t complete wusses when we got into higher grades. When I got older I was bullied viciously as well by a group of kids and I had very few friends. My Dad had left by then and my mom bought a pair of gloves for us both and mouth pieces and taught me how to fight in the garage. I didn&#39;t fight back for 2 years though. I went through hell, hated school, teachers did nothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen they jumped me when I was walking home from school one day, about 4-5 of them. Beat the heck out of me real bad and still, because there was no video camera&#39;s on the area, no one did anything. It was even on school grounds still. Usually they got me in the hallways, but this time they ganged up on me for what? My mom took me home and told me I was to fight each and every one of them one on one whenever I saw they were alone. I told the principle one last time I didn&#39;t want to fight but if they didn&#39;t do anything about it I would. They told me not to make threats. I went to school and singled each one out over 3-4 months and never had any problems after that. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou all seem like the parents who would teach your kids to endure rather than stand and fight when pressed, concerned over petty stuff and so concerned about such a harmless little phrase. That&#39;s why my generation is growing up to be a bunch of wusses; men who don&#39;t stand their ground and are more worried about others feelings than standing for what they believe in, or protecting themselves. It&#39;s pathetic. Maybe you should say that to your kid so they can toughen up a bit. The real world doesn&#39;t CARE if they get their feelings hurt or feel or think they are dumb. You aren&#39;t preparing them for the real world, you are hindering them. <br/>\n______________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what &quot;his generation&quot; is, but the name in the post linked to this.

I know some of my pages have been in Stumble Upon; I don&#39;t know how that works.
