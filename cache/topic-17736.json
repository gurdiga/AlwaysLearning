To put it in a *nutshell*: variety and moderation are the keys.<br/>\n<br/>\nRefined wheat is not the only grain in the grocery store.  Try polenta or barley for a side dish.  Many varieties of rice are available today.  Buy rice and rye crackers to offer along with wheat crackers.  Have oatmeal for breakfast.  Make granola bars.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo to a farmer&#39;s market or check out the canned or frozen food sections for exotic fruits and vegetables.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are dozens of varieties of legumes.  Browse a cookbook or the web for new ways to cook them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out ethnic recipes.  Many non-American cuisines are based on ample amounts of vegetables and grains flavored with smaller amounts of meat/seafood/legumes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCube tofu and serve it in a spicy curry sauce.  (OK, my kids won&#39;t eat that, but they do like plain cubes of tofu.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery once in awhile, have a good old American chunk of meat with a side of potatoes :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOur children may not always choose to eat a variety of foods, but if variety is available, they will be more likely to choose it in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Eating too many unrefined carbs is bad, but we can no longer go the Atkins route since we have all learned over the last week how bad the oversight is of our beef and other meat supply&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Here is a better reason for not going the Atkins route: it doesn&#39;t offer variety or moderation.  BTW, I live less than an hour from the ranch in Mabton where the cow was raised.  Although I am horrified that this happened, I believe it will lead to positive changes in the food processing system.

The thing Holly was moving cookies and <br/>\ncandy to look for the other day was banana bread.   <br/>\n <br/>\n*******<br/>\n <br/>\nWe&#39;re having to fight this battle now, and I wish i&#39;d been smarter about food in the first place.  Years ago, when Will was young and a very picky eater, he was also a stick-child.  So much so that we had WIC and Public Health nurses and school nurses pushing unsolicited advice.  I started buying and allowing more junky food because at least he would eat that.  when all I offered him was healthy food, he would skip meals, then tell the school nurse he hadn&#39;t eaten since school lunch the previous day.  Getting him to eat became a huge manipulation playing field.  It was a power-bartering point because he could be the center of attention by refusing to eat, while all adults in attendance begged him to eat.  <br/>\n <br/>\nAndy came along with his own eating issues, and turned into a carb-junkie, who is now about 20 lbs overweight.  At least when he refuses to eat in our new healthy pantry, no one will worry I&#39;m being a negligent Mom.  <br/>\n <br/>\nThe problem is that in our efforts to have Will look healthier than a wraith, we helped Andy develop an expectation of snacky foods that leaves him feeling deprived if we offer only fruit for snacks.  I&#39;m having some trouble selling it as making better choices to take good care of our bodies when it feels like deprivation!  We&#39;ve made it a family change, so maybe it can just become the way we all eat.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt will be tough tho, since I grew up in a family where junk food was a reward, and &#39;fun food&#39; was tightly controlled.  Breakfast was ALWAYS Total cereal on weekdays, we were only allowed to eat Roman Meal bread, and had to eat all our vegies (even things that made us gag) and dessert was only for those who ate all their dinner.  Until my sis and I reached our teens and put on weight (from Dorito and Pizza at the school snack bar) when dessert cancelled for us.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI think it was my Mom&#39;s over-reaction to the fact that her sisters were all overweight.  My Mom had been quite a crash-dieter in high school, and my Dad puts great value on being thin.  In later years, my Mom let herself gain weight and later realized it was her way of getting back at my Dad for being such a jerk.  I know some part of me (and my sis, too, because we&#39;ve talked about it) resists losing weight because when we do, Daddy will make a big fuss over it -- like we had no value as fat girls, but thinner we&#39;ll be better people.    <br/>\n <br/>\nI guess my point in all this rambling is that controlling your kids&#39; diet leads to all kinds of fall-out, much of it multi-generational.  And the road back to healthy eating habits can be arduous.  I&#39;m pretty sure if I&#39;d been less externally controlled, I&#39;d be better at this issue with our kids.<br/>\n <br/>\nSylvia<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFind out what made the Top Yahoo!

In 1915, the national average of sugar <br/>\n&gt;consumption (per year) was around 15 to 20 pounds <br/>\n&gt;per person. Today the average person consumes his/her<br/>\n&gt;weight in sugar, plus over 20 pounds of corn syrup. To <br/>\n&gt;add more horrors to these facts there are some people <br/>\n&gt;that use no sweets and some who use much less than the <br/>\n&gt;average figure, which means that there is a percentage <br/>\n&gt;of the population that consume a great deal more refined<br/>\n&gt;sugar than their body weight. The human body cannot <br/>\n&gt;tolerate this large amount of refined carbohydrates. <br/>\n&gt;The vital organs in the body are actually damaged by this<br/>\n&gt;gross intake of sugar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Refined sugar contains no fiber, no minerals, no <br/>\n&gt;proteins, no fats, no enzymes, only empty calories. What <br/>\n&gt;happens when you eat a refined carbohydrate like sugar? <br/>\n&gt;Your body must borrow vital nutrients from healthy<br/>\n&gt;cells to metabolize the incomplete food. Calcium, <br/>\n&gt;sodium, potassium and magnesium are taken from various <br/>\n&gt;parts of the body to make use of the sugar.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        Many times, so much calcium is used to neutralize <br/>\n&gt;the effects of sugar that the bones become osteoporotic <br/>\n&gt;due to the withdrawn calcium. Likewise, the teeth are <br/>\n&gt;affected and they lose their components until decay occurs <br/>\n&gt;and hastens their loss. ...Refined sugar is void of all <br/>\n&gt;nutrients, consequently it causes the body to deplete its <br/>\n&gt;own stores of various vitamins, minerals and enzymes. <br/>\n&gt;If sugar consumption is continued, an over-acid condition <br/>\n&gt;results, and more minerals are needed from deep in the<br/>\n&gt;body to correct the imbalance. If the body is lacking the <br/>\n&gt;nutrients used to metabolize sugar, it will not be able <br/>\n&gt;to properly handle and rid itself of the poisonous <br/>\n&gt;residues. <br/>\n&gt;These wastes accumulate through the brain and nervous <br/>\n&gt;system, <br/>\n&gt;which speeds up cellular death. The bloodstream becomes<br/>\n&gt;over-loaded with waste products and symptoms of carbonic <br/>\n&gt;poisoning result.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Sugar also makes the blood very thick and sticky, <br/>\n&gt;inhibiting much of the blood flow into the minute <br/>\n&gt;capillaries <br/>\n&gt;that supply our gums and teeth with vital nutrients. <br/>\n&gt;Therefore, we wind up with diseased gums and starving <br/>\n&gt;teeth. <br/>\n&gt;America and England, the two largest sugar consumers, have <br/>\n&gt;horrendous dental problems.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....In 1948, a $57,000 ten-year study was awarded to Harvard<br/>\n&gt;University by the Sugar Research Foundation to find out how <br/>\n&gt;sugar causes cavities in teeth and how to prevent it. In <br/>\n&gt;1958, <br/>\n&gt;Time magazine reported the findings, which were reported in <br/>\n&gt;the Dental Association Journal. They discovered there was <br/>\n&gt;no <br/>\n&gt;way to prevent the problem and their funding immediately <br/>\n&gt;disappeared.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....&quot;The most significant human study was done in Sweden, <br/>\n&gt;reported in 1954, and known as the Vipeholm Dental Caries <br/>\n&gt;Study. More than 400 adult mental patients were placed on <br/>\n&gt;controlled diets and observed for five years. The subjects <br/>\n&gt;were divided into various groups. Some ate complex and <br/>\n&gt;simple<br/>\n&gt;carbohydrates at mealtimes only, while other supplemented <br/>\n&gt;mealtime food with between-meal-snacks, sweetened with <br/>\n&gt;sucrose, chocolate, caramel, or toffee. Among the <br/>\n&gt;conclusions <br/>\n&gt;drawn from the study, was that sucrose consumption<br/>\n&gt;could increase caries activity. The risk increased if <br/>\n&gt;the sucrose was consumed in a sticky form that adhered to <br/>\n&gt;the tooth&#39;s surfaces. The greatest damage was inflicted by <br/>\n&gt;foods with high concentrations of sucrose, in sticky form, <br/>\n&gt;eaten between meals, even if contact with the tooth&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;surfaces was brief. Caries, due to the intake of foods <br/>\n&gt;with high sucrose levels, could be decreased when such <br/>\n&gt;offending foods were eliminated from the diet. But <br/>\n&gt;individual <br/>\n&gt;differences existed, and in some cases, caries continued to<br/>\n&gt;appear despite avoidance of refined sugar or maximum <br/>\n&gt;restriction of natural sugars and total dietary <br/>\n&gt;carbohydrates.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;(2)<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Diabetes is another commonly known disease caused by <br/>\n&gt;sugar as well as a high fat diet. Diabetes is caused by the <br/>\n&gt;failure of the pancreas to produce adequate insulin when <br/>\n&gt;the blood sugar rises. A concentrated amount of sugar <br/>\n&gt;introduced <br/>\n&gt;into the system sends the body into shock from the rapid <br/>\n&gt;rise <br/>\n&gt;in the blood sugar level. The pancreas eventually wears out<br/>\n&gt;from overwork and diabetes then rears its ugly head.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas overreacts to the <br/>\n&gt;large<br/>\n&gt;amount of sugar in the blood and releases too much insulin <br/>\n&gt;leaving <br/>\n&gt;one with the &quot;tired&quot; feeling as the blood sugar level <br/>\n&gt;becomes <br/>\n&gt;lower than it should be.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....&quot;A recent article in the British Medical Journal, <br/>\n&gt;entitled <br/>\n&gt;The Sweet Road to Gallstones, reported that refined sugar <br/>\n&gt;may <br/>\n&gt;be one of the major dietary risk factors in gallstone <br/>\n&gt;disease. <br/>\n&gt;Gallstones are composed of fats and calcium. Sugar can <br/>\n&gt;upset <br/>\n&gt;all of the minerals, and one of the minerals, calcium, can <br/>\n&gt;become toxic or nonfunctioning, depositing itself anywhere <br/>\n&gt;in<br/>\n&gt;the body, including the gallbladder.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....&quot;One out of ten Americans has gallstones. This risk <br/>\n&gt;increases to<br/>\n&gt;one out of every five after age forty. Gallstones may go <br/>\n&gt;unnoticed <br/>\n&gt;or may cause pain-wrenching pain. Other symptoms might <br/>\n&gt;include <br/>\n&gt;bloating, belching, and intolerance to foods.&quot; (3) <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Another serious problem with sugar that is<br/>\n&gt;now coming to the forefront is the various levels of mental <br/>\n&gt;problems. Our brains are very sensitive and react to quick <br/>\n&gt;chemical changes within the body. As sugar is consumed, our <br/>\n&gt;cells are robbed of their B vitamin, which destroys them, <br/>\n&gt;and <br/>\n&gt;insulin production is inhibited. Low insulin production <br/>\n&gt;means a <br/>\n&gt;high sugar (glucose) level in the bloodstream, which can <br/>\n&gt;lead to a<br/>\n&gt;confused mental state or unsound mind, and has also been <br/>\n&gt;linked <br/>\n&gt;with juvenile criminal behavior. Dr. Alexander G. Schauss, <br/>\n&gt;brings <br/>\n&gt;this solemn fact out in his book, Diet, Crime and <br/>\n&gt;Delinquency. <br/>\n&gt;Many mental ward and prison inmates are &quot;sugarholics&quot; and <br/>\n&gt;erratic <br/>\n&gt;emotional outbreaks often follow a sugar binge.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;REFINED SUGAR-A DRUG?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Refined sugar, by some, is called a drug, because in the <br/>\n&gt;refining<br/>\n&gt;process everything of food value has been removed except <br/>\n&gt;the<br/>\n&gt;carbohydrates-pure calories, without vitamins, minerals, <br/>\n&gt;proteins, <br/>\n&gt;fats, enzymes or any of the other elements that make up <br/>\n&gt;food. Many <br/>\n&gt;nutrition experts say that white sugar is extremely <br/>\n&gt;harmful, possibly <br/>\n&gt;as harmful as a drug, especially in the quantities consumed <br/>\n&gt;by the <br/>\n&gt;present-day American.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Dr. David Reuben, author of Everything You Always Wanted <br/>\n&gt;to Know<br/>\n&gt;About Nutrition says, &quot;.white refined sugar-is not a food. <br/>\n&gt;It is a <br/>\n&gt;pure chemical extracted from plant sources, purer in fact <br/>\n&gt;than <br/>\n&gt;cocaine, which it resembles in many ways. Its true name is <br/>\n&gt;sucrose <br/>\n&gt;and its chemical formula is C12H22O11. It has 12 carbon <br/>\n&gt;atoms, <br/>\n&gt;22 hydrogen atoms, 11 oxygen atoms, and absolutely nothing <br/>\n&gt;else to <br/>\n&gt;offer.&quot; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....The chemical formula for cocaine is C17H21NO4. Sugar&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;formula <br/>\n&gt;again is C12H22O11. For all practical purposes, the <br/>\n&gt;difference is <br/>\n&gt;that sugar is missing the &quot;N&quot;, or nitrogen atom.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Refining means to make &quot;pure&quot; by a process of extraction <br/>\n&gt;or<br/>\n&gt;separation. Sugars are refined by taking a natural food, <br/>\n&gt;which <br/>\n&gt;contains a high percentage of sugar, and then removing all <br/>\n&gt;elements of that food until only the sugar remains. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....While sugar is commonly made from sugar cane or<br/>\n&gt;sugar beets. Through heating and mechanical and chemical <br/>\n&gt;processing, all vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, enzymes <br/>\n&gt;and indeed every nutrient is removed until only the sugar <br/>\n&gt;remains. Sugar cane and sugar beets are first harvested and <br/>\n&gt;then chopped into small pieces, squeezing out the juice, <br/>\n&gt;which<br/>\n&gt;is then mixed with water. This liquid is then heated, and <br/>\n&gt;lime <br/>\n&gt;is added. Moisture is boiled away, and the remaining fluid <br/>\n&gt;is <br/>\n&gt;pumped into vacuum pans to concentrate the juice. By this <br/>\n&gt;time, <br/>\n&gt;the liquid is starting to crystallize, and is ready to be <br/>\n&gt;placed <br/>\n&gt;into a centrifuge machine where any remaining residues <br/>\n&gt;(like <br/>\n&gt;molasses) are spun away. The crystals are then dissolved by <br/>\n&gt;heating to the boiling point and passed through charcoal <br/>\n&gt;filters. After the crystals condense, they are bleached <br/>\n&gt;snow-white usually by the use of pork or cattle bones.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....During the refining process, 64 food elements are <br/>\n&gt;destroyed. <br/>\n&gt;All the potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, manganese, <br/>\n&gt;phosphate, <br/>\n&gt;and sulfate are removed. The A, D, and B, vitamins are <br/>\n&gt;destroyed. <br/>\n&gt;Amino acids, vital enzymes, unsaturated fats, and all fiber <br/>\n&gt;are <br/>\n&gt;gone. To a lesser or greater degree, all refined sweeteners <br/>\n&gt;such as corn syrup, maple syrup, etc., undergo similar <br/>\n&gt;destructive <br/>\n&gt;processes. Molasses is the chemical and deranged nutrients <br/>\n&gt;that <br/>\n&gt;is a byproduct of sugar manufacture. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Sugar manufacturers are aggressive in defending their <br/>\n&gt;product <br/>\n&gt;and have a strong political lobby which allows them to <br/>\n&gt;continue <br/>\n&gt;selling a deadly food item that by all reason should not be <br/>\n&gt;allowed in the American diet. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....If you have any doubts as to the detriments of sugar <br/>\n&gt;(sucrose), <br/>\n&gt;try leaving it out of your diet for several weeks and see <br/>\n&gt;if it <br/>\n&gt;makes a difference! You may also notice you have acquired <br/>\n&gt;an <br/>\n&gt;addiction and experience some withdrawal symptoms. <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;....Studies show that &quot;sugar&quot; is just as habit-forming as <br/>\n&gt;any <br/>\n&gt;narcotic; and its use, misuse, and abuse is our nation&#39;s <br/>\n&gt;number <br/>\n&gt;one disaster. It is no wonder when we consider all the <br/>\n&gt;products <br/>\n&gt;we consume daily which are loaded with sugar! The average <br/>\n&gt;healthy <br/>\n&gt;digestive system can digest and eliminate from two to four <br/>\n&gt;teaspoons of sugar daily, usually without noticeable <br/>\n&gt;problems, <br/>\n&gt;(that is if damage is not already present). One 12 oz. Cola <br/>\n&gt;contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and that&#39;s aside from the <br/>\n&gt;caffeine. <br/>\n&gt;It&#39;s the sugar that gives you quick energy, but only for a <br/>\n&gt;brief <br/>\n&gt;time due to the rise of the blood sugar level. But the body <br/>\n&gt;quickly releases a rush of insulin, which rapidly lowers <br/>\n&gt;the blood <br/>\n&gt;sugar and causes a significant drop in energy and <br/>\n&gt;endurance. It is<br/>\n&gt;easy to see why America&#39;s health is in serious trouble.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;EFFECT OF SUGAR ON NEUROLOGICAL PROCESSES <br/>\n&gt;....One of the keys to orderly brain function is glutamic <br/>\n&gt;acid, and this compound is found in many vegetables. When <br/>\n&gt;sugar <br/>\n&gt;is consumed, the bacteria in the intestines, which <br/>\n&gt;manufacture <br/>\n&gt;B vitamin complexes, begin to die-these bacteria normally <br/>\n&gt;thrive<br/>\n&gt;in a symbiotic relationship with the human body. When the <br/>\n&gt;B vitamin complex level declines, the glutamic acid <br/>\n&gt;(normally <br/>\n&gt;transformed into &quot;go&quot; &quot;no-go&quot; directive neural enzymes by <br/>\n&gt;the <br/>\n&gt;B vitamins) is not processed and sleepiness occurs, as well <br/>\n&gt;as <br/>\n&gt;a decreased ability for short-term memory function and <br/>\n&gt;numerical<br/>\n&gt;calculative abilities. The removal of B vitamins when foods <br/>\n&gt;are<br/>\n&gt;&quot;processed&quot; makes the situation even more tenuous.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;WHAT ABOUT GUM CHEWING? <br/>\n&gt;....Besides the sugar in gum being damaging<br/>\n&gt;to the teeth there is another harmful problem to consider <br/>\n&gt;and that is: &quot;teeth and jaws weren&#39;t designed for more than <br/>\n&gt;a <br/>\n&gt;few minutes of solid chewing per day-far less than the two <br/>\n&gt;hours clocked in daily by hardcore gum chewers. All this <br/>\n&gt;chewing results in inordinate wear on the jawbone, gum <br/>\n&gt;tissue <br/>\n&gt;and lower molars, and can change the alignment of the jaws&quot; <br/>\n&gt;says<br/>\n&gt;Michael Elsohn, D.D.S., in the Medical Tribune.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.macrobiotics.co.uk/sugar.htm\">http://www.macrobiotics.co.uk/sugar.htm</a><br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;--- End forwarded message ---<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;Yahoo!

(1)<br/>\n<br/>\n...Consumption of processed foods (which are laced <br/>\nwith sugar) cost the American public more than $54 <br/>\nbillion in dental bills each year, so the dental <br/>\nindustry reaps huge profits from the programmed <br/>\naddiction of the public to sugar products. <br/>\n<br/>\n...Today we have a nation that is addicted to<br/>\nsugar. In 1915, the national average of sugar <br/>\nconsumption (per year) was around 15 to 20 pounds <br/>\nper person. Today the average person consumes his/her<br/>\nweight in sugar, plus over 20 pounds of corn syrup. To <br/>\nadd more horrors to these facts there are some people <br/>\nthat use no sweets and some who use much less than the <br/>\naverage figure, which means that there is a percentage <br/>\nof the population that consume a great deal more refined<br/>\nsugar than their body weight. The human body cannot <br/>\ntolerate this large amount of refined carbohydrates. <br/>\nThe vital organs in the body are actually damaged by this<br/>\ngross intake of sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\n...Refined sugar contains no fiber, no minerals, no <br/>\nproteins, no fats, no enzymes, only empty calories. What <br/>\nhappens when you eat a refined carbohydrate like sugar? <br/>\nYour body must borrow vital nutrients from healthy<br/>\ncells to metabolize the incomplete food. Calcium, <br/>\nsodium, potassium and magnesium are taken from various <br/>\nparts of the body to make use of the sugar.<br/>\n<br/>\n        Many times, so much calcium is used to neutralize <br/>\nthe effects of sugar that the bones become osteoporotic <br/>\ndue to the withdrawn calcium. Likewise, the teeth are <br/>\naffected and they lose their components until decay occurs <br/>\nand hastens their loss. ...Refined sugar is void of all <br/>\nnutrients, consequently it causes the body to deplete its <br/>\nown stores of various vitamins, minerals and enzymes. <br/>\nIf sugar consumption is continued, an over-acid condition <br/>\nresults, and more minerals are needed from deep in the<br/>\nbody to correct the imbalance. If the body is lacking the <br/>\nnutrients used to metabolize sugar, it will not be able <br/>\nto properly handle and rid itself of the poisonous <br/>\nresidues. <br/>\nThese wastes accumulate through the brain and nervous <br/>\nsystem, <br/>\nwhich speeds up cellular death. The bloodstream becomes<br/>\nover-loaded with waste products and symptoms of carbonic <br/>\npoisoning result.<br/>\n<br/>\n...Sugar also makes the blood very thick and sticky, <br/>\ninhibiting much of the blood flow into the minute <br/>\ncapillaries <br/>\nthat supply our gums and teeth with vital nutrients. <br/>\nTherefore, we wind up with diseased gums and starving <br/>\nteeth. <br/>\nAmerica and England, the two largest sugar consumers, have <br/>\nhorrendous dental problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n...In 1948, a $57,000 ten-year study was awarded to Harvard<br/>\nUniversity by the Sugar Research Foundation to find out how <br/>\nsugar causes cavities in teeth and how to prevent it. In <br/>\n1958, <br/>\nTime magazine reported the findings, which were reported in <br/>\nthe Dental Association Journal. They discovered there was <br/>\nno <br/>\nway to prevent the problem and their funding immediately <br/>\ndisappeared.<br/>\n<br/>\n...&quot;The most significant human study was done in Sweden, <br/>\nreported in 1954, and known as the Vipeholm Dental Caries <br/>\nStudy. More than 400 adult mental patients were placed on <br/>\ncontrolled diets and observed for five years. The subjects <br/>\nwere divided into various groups. Some ate complex and <br/>\nsimple<br/>\ncarbohydrates at mealtimes only, while other supplemented <br/>\nmealtime food with between-meal-snacks, sweetened with <br/>\nsucrose, chocolate, caramel, or toffee. Among the <br/>\nconclusions <br/>\ndrawn from the study, was that sucrose consumption<br/>\ncould increase caries activity. The risk increased if <br/>\nthe sucrose was consumed in a sticky form that adhered to <br/>\nthe tooth&#39;s surfaces. The greatest damage was inflicted by <br/>\nfoods with high concentrations of sucrose, in sticky form, <br/>\neaten between meals, even if contact with the tooth&#39;s <br/>\nsurfaces was brief. Caries, due to the intake of foods <br/>\nwith high sucrose levels, could be decreased when such <br/>\noffending foods were eliminated from the diet. But <br/>\nindividual <br/>\ndifferences existed, and in some cases, caries continued to<br/>\nappear despite avoidance of refined sugar or maximum <br/>\nrestriction of natural sugars and total dietary <br/>\ncarbohydrates.&quot; <br/>\n(2)<br/>\n<br/>\n...Diabetes is another commonly known disease caused by <br/>\nsugar as well as a high fat diet. Diabetes is caused by the <br/>\nfailure of the pancreas to produce adequate insulin when <br/>\nthe blood sugar rises. A concentrated amount of sugar <br/>\nintroduced <br/>\ninto the system sends the body into shock from the rapid <br/>\nrise <br/>\nin the blood sugar level. The pancreas eventually wears out<br/>\nfrom overwork and diabetes then rears its ugly head.<br/>\n<br/>\n...Hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas overreacts to the <br/>\nlarge<br/>\namount of sugar in the blood and releases too much insulin <br/>\nleaving <br/>\none with the &quot;tired&quot; feeling as the blood sugar level <br/>\nbecomes <br/>\nlower than it should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n...&quot;A recent article in the British Medical Journal, <br/>\nentitled <br/>\nThe Sweet Road to Gallstones, reported that refined sugar <br/>\nmay <br/>\nbe one of the major dietary risk factors in gallstone <br/>\ndisease. <br/>\nGallstones are composed of fats and calcium. Sugar can <br/>\nupset <br/>\nall of the minerals, and one of the minerals, calcium, can <br/>\nbecome toxic or nonfunctioning, depositing itself anywhere <br/>\nin<br/>\nthe body, including the gallbladder.<br/>\n<br/>\n...&quot;One out of ten Americans has gallstones. This risk <br/>\nincreases to<br/>\none out of every five after age forty. Gallstones may go <br/>\nunnoticed <br/>\nor may cause pain-wrenching pain. Other symptoms might <br/>\ninclude <br/>\nbloating, belching, and intolerance to foods.&quot; (3) <br/>\n<br/>\n...Another serious problem with sugar that is<br/>\nnow coming to the forefront is the various levels of mental <br/>\nproblems. Our brains are very sensitive and react to quick <br/>\nchemical changes within the body. As sugar is consumed, our <br/>\ncells are robbed of their B vitamin, which destroys them, <br/>\nand <br/>\ninsulin production is inhibited. Low insulin production <br/>\nmeans a <br/>\nhigh sugar (glucose) level in the bloodstream, which can <br/>\nlead to a<br/>\nconfused mental state or unsound mind, and has also been <br/>\nlinked <br/>\nwith juvenile criminal behavior. Dr. Alexander G. Schauss, <br/>\nbrings <br/>\nthis solemn fact out in his book, Diet, Crime and <br/>\nDelinquency. <br/>\nMany mental ward and prison inmates are &quot;sugarholics&quot; and <br/>\nerratic <br/>\nemotional outbreaks often follow a sugar binge.<br/>\n<br/>\nREFINED SUGAR-A DRUG?<br/>\n<br/>\n...Refined sugar, by some, is called a drug, because in the <br/>\nrefining<br/>\nprocess everything of food value has been removed except <br/>\nthe<br/>\ncarbohydrates-pure calories, without vitamins, minerals, <br/>\nproteins, <br/>\nfats, enzymes or any of the other elements that make up <br/>\nfood. Many <br/>\nnutrition experts say that white sugar is extremely <br/>\nharmful, possibly <br/>\nas harmful as a drug, especially in the quantities consumed <br/>\nby the <br/>\npresent-day American.<br/>\n<br/>\n...Dr. David Reuben, author of Everything You Always Wanted <br/>\nto Know<br/>\nAbout Nutrition says, &quot;.white refined sugar-is not a food. <br/>\nIt is a <br/>\npure chemical extracted from plant sources, purer in fact <br/>\nthan <br/>\ncocaine, which it resembles in many ways. Its true name is <br/>\nsucrose <br/>\nand its chemical formula is C12H22O11. It has 12 carbon <br/>\natoms, <br/>\n22 hydrogen atoms, 11 oxygen atoms, and absolutely nothing <br/>\nelse to <br/>\noffer.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n...The chemical formula for cocaine is C17H21NO4. Sugar&#39;s <br/>\nformula <br/>\nagain is C12H22O11. For all practical purposes, the <br/>\ndifference is <br/>\nthat sugar is missing the &quot;N&quot;, or nitrogen atom.<br/>\n<br/>\n...Refining means to make &quot;pure&quot; by a process of extraction <br/>\nor<br/>\nseparation. Sugars are refined by taking a natural food, <br/>\nwhich <br/>\ncontains a high percentage of sugar, and then removing all <br/>\nelements of that food until only the sugar remains. <br/>\n<br/>\n...While sugar is commonly made from sugar cane or<br/>\nsugar beets. Through heating and mechanical and chemical <br/>\nprocessing, all vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, enzymes <br/>\nand indeed every nutrient is removed until only the sugar <br/>\nremains. Sugar cane and sugar beets are first harvested and <br/>\nthen chopped into small pieces, squeezing out the juice, <br/>\nwhich<br/>\nis then mixed with water. This liquid is then heated, and <br/>\nlime <br/>\nis added. Moisture is boiled away, and the remaining fluid <br/>\nis <br/>\npumped into vacuum pans to concentrate the juice. By this <br/>\ntime, <br/>\nthe liquid is starting to crystallize, and is ready to be <br/>\nplaced <br/>\ninto a centrifuge machine where any remaining residues <br/>\n(like <br/>\nmolasses) are spun away. The crystals are then dissolved by <br/>\nheating to the boiling point and passed through charcoal <br/>\nfilters. After the crystals condense, they are bleached <br/>\nsnow-white usually by the use of pork or cattle bones.<br/>\n<br/>\n...During the refining process, 64 food elements are <br/>\ndestroyed. <br/>\nAll the potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, manganese, <br/>\nphosphate, <br/>\nand sulfate are removed. The A, D, and B, vitamins are <br/>\ndestroyed. <br/>\nAmino acids, vital enzymes, unsaturated fats, and all fiber <br/>\nare <br/>\ngone. To a lesser or greater degree, all refined sweeteners <br/>\nsuch as corn syrup, maple syrup, etc., undergo similar <br/>\ndestructive <br/>\nprocesses. Molasses is the chemical and deranged nutrients <br/>\nthat <br/>\nis a byproduct of sugar manufacture. <br/>\n<br/>\n...Sugar manufacturers are aggressive in defending their <br/>\nproduct <br/>\nand have a strong political lobby which allows them to <br/>\ncontinue <br/>\nselling a deadly food item that by all reason should not be <br/>\nallowed in the American diet. <br/>\n<br/>\n...If you have any doubts as to the detriments of sugar <br/>\n(sucrose), <br/>\ntry leaving it out of your diet for several weeks and see <br/>\nif it <br/>\nmakes a difference! You may also notice you have acquired <br/>\nan <br/>\naddiction and experience some withdrawal symptoms. <br/>\n<br/>\n...Studies show that &quot;sugar&quot; is just as habit-forming as <br/>\nany <br/>\nnarcotic; and its use, misuse, and abuse is our nation&#39;s <br/>\nnumber <br/>\none disaster. It is no wonder when we consider all the <br/>\nproducts <br/>\nwe consume daily which are loaded with sugar! The average <br/>\nhealthy <br/>\ndigestive system can digest and eliminate from two to four <br/>\nteaspoons of sugar daily, usually without noticeable <br/>\nproblems, <br/>\n(that is if damage is not already present). One 12 oz. Cola <br/>\ncontains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and that&#39;s aside from the <br/>\ncaffeine. <br/>\nIt&#39;s the sugar that gives you quick energy, but only for a <br/>\nbrief <br/>\ntime due to the rise of the blood sugar level. But the body <br/>\nquickly releases a rush of insulin, which rapidly lowers <br/>\nthe blood <br/>\nsugar and causes a significant drop in energy and <br/>\nendurance. It is<br/>\neasy to see why America&#39;s health is in serious trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nEFFECT OF SUGAR ON NEUROLOGICAL PROCESSES <br/>\n...One of the keys to orderly brain function is glutamic <br/>\nacid, and this compound is found in many vegetables. When <br/>\nsugar <br/>\nis consumed, the bacteria in the intestines, which <br/>\nmanufacture <br/>\nB vitamin complexes, begin to die-these bacteria normally <br/>\nthrive<br/>\nin a symbiotic relationship with the human body. When the <br/>\nB vitamin complex level declines, the glutamic acid <br/>\n(normally <br/>\ntransformed into &quot;go&quot; &quot;no-go&quot; directive neural enzymes by <br/>\nthe <br/>\nB vitamins) is not processed and sleepiness occurs, as well <br/>\nas <br/>\na decreased ability for short-term memory function and <br/>\nnumerical<br/>\ncalculative abilities. The removal of B vitamins when foods <br/>\nare<br/>\n&quot;processed&quot; makes the situation even more tenuous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWHAT ABOUT GUM CHEWING? <br/>\n...Besides the sugar in gum being damaging<br/>\nto the teeth there is another harmful problem to consider <br/>\nand that is: &quot;teeth and jaws weren&#39;t designed for more than <br/>\na <br/>\nfew minutes of solid chewing per day-far less than the two <br/>\nhours clocked in daily by hardcore gum chewers. All this <br/>\nchewing results in inordinate wear on the jawbone, gum <br/>\ntissue <br/>\nand lower molars, and can change the alignment of the jaws&quot; <br/>\nsays<br/>\nMichael Elsohn, D.D.S., in the Medical Tribune.<br/>\n<br/>\n        <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.macrobiotics.co.uk/sugar.htm\">http://www.macrobiotics.co.uk/sugar.htm</a><br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n--- End forwarded message ---</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17755,"nextTopicId":17552}}
