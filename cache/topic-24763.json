We did get 100 Easy Lessons <br/>\nbut barely use it.  She writes letters to her friends and extended family <br/>\nmembers.  She used to ask me how to spell every word, but can write a few <br/>\nsentences/words on her own now.   She wanted to be an Author so she put <br/>\npaper together and taped it (I would have prefered staples bc its a mess, <br/>\nbut its a book nonetheless).  Its called Harry Potter and the Fearful <br/>\nSnowman.  She has about 8 pages written so far, all her own words - she asks <br/>\nme how to spell the words and writes them.  She even asked our local <br/>\nLibrarian if she could write a copy of her book to put on the library shelf <br/>\nand they said they would!  &lt;grin&gt;  She has written her own address book with <br/>\nfriends and family names, addresses and phone numers.  She loves maps, like <br/>\nher daddy, and she points to a country, copies the name and draws a <br/>\npicucture of the country and the flag.  I&#39;ve never taught her geography, and <br/>\nshe knows many country flags and how to spell the country name.  My point is <br/>\nthat we haven&#39;t done any *traditional* or scheduled reading or writing <br/>\nlessons.  Everything we&#39;ve done has come from my dd and she does whatever <br/>\nshe can on her own and when she asks how to spell or do something then I do. <br/>\nShe is starting to pick up words here and there and can sound out some <br/>\nthings to spell on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nDawn<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: &quot;beautifulgoddessmommy&quot; &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:beautifulgoddessmommy@...\">beautifulgoddessmommy@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Monday, March 20, 2006 12:55 PM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Hello I am a new memmber<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Hello my name is Jennifer and I have 2 little boys 5 and 6 they are<br/>\n&gt; spirited boys and keep me on my toes.
