She has always discussed everything with me and most of the<br/>\nthings she tells me about her friends I just absorb.  There have been a<br/>\ncouple of times that I had to step in and they have gotten angry with<br/>\nher.  She just replies, &quot;I tell my mom everything.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe knows that I trust her to know a safe secret from an unsafe one but<br/>\nshe feels weird keeping it from me.  The funny thing is, when the<br/>\nneighborhood kids have a problem they come to her, maybe it&#39;s their<br/>\nroundabout way of telling me too.  Most of them have parents who are not<br/>\ninvolved, as long as their kids aren&#39;t bothering THEM they don&#39;t care<br/>\nmuch WHAT they are doing.
