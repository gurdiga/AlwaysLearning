It seems like you&#39;re asking for her understanding by doing that - and you don&#39;t need her understanding or empathy. It&#39;s an unfair comparison anyway; as an adult you have far more resources than a 7-year-old, in terms of managing your frustration and overwhelm.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou were asking her, by mentioning that, to NOT ask things of you when you&#39;re busy doing something else - something most 7-year-olds would have a very hard time remembering in the moment. And by putting her at bay, you could potentially miss a lot of the natural exuberance and excitement she has about things as they come up. Each moment is precious! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I&#39;m going through a tough time - worries, PMS, etc. - I remember to take a deep breath FIRST, and look at my sons in their eyes.

Her older sister has a way of &quot;pushing her buttons&quot; and will use words to get her going, and then she will end up hitting or doing something else physical out of her anger, and then she&#39;ll say &quot;it&#39;s her fault!!&quot;  In the past I would get angry myself (guess where she gets it from) or I would get stuck on telling her that what she does with her body is &quot;her fault&quot;, no matter what her sister does to her.  Well, today I really put that aside, I really was able to put myself in her shoes and realize how she felt and I was able to hold her and tell her I understood (not putting details here) but she melted and softened and I really was able to comfort her and help her deal with the feelings of anger and helplessness that she was feeling, and by her knowing that I &quot;got it&quot; she was able to &quot;feel&quot; that there truly was another option.  By empathizing<br/>\n with her it really helped ME too--  where in the past I would default into how I &quot;thought&quot; I should handle it, but when I was able to feel what she felt, and we really connected.   A potentially bad moment became a beautiful moment of relationship. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love what&#39;s happening in our family.  :-) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStephanie in Upstate NY<br/>\nMom to Lauren (10), Sophia (8) and Hallie (5) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSent: Mon, May 10, 2010 8:52:56 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] after the fact<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n-=-So, I&#39;m wondering how some of you handle things after you&#39;ve had <br/>\nyour less-than-ideal unschooling moments.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize, explain, and go out of my way to make amends.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut more important than that is to think carefully about what I could <br/>\nhave done better to prevent the bad moment.
