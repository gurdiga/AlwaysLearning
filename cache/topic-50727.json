At one point a couple years back I would occasionally present a craft to my kids and then would get upset (mostly internally) if they weren&#39;t interested in doing it.  I decided to seek out projects that I myself was interested in and if they wanted to participate fine, if not, no strings attached (on my part).  My 7 year old is highly creative and imaginative and when he does happen to be interested in participating in a project that I&#39;ve got going, he takes one look at the materials and immediately has an original idea for how he would like to use them:)  <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo examples.  <br/>\n<br/>\n#1-In december I gathered all of our craft items as well as items that I had collected from nature and set them all out on the floor with the intent to make &#39;Winter Scenes&#39;.  One of the items was styrofoam balls (I was thinking &quot;great to use to make snowmen&quot;).  My 7 year old took one look at the piles of stuff, noticed the styrofoam balls and immediately saw &quot;planets&quot;.  He proceeded to make 5 different galaxies by painting the styrofoam balls different colors and glueing them to different pieces of cardboard.  <br/>\n<br/>\n#2-Over the weekend I came across some fun projects in a book titled &#39;Big Ideas For Small Mathematicians&#39;.  We checked this book out because my 7 year old is fascinated with fractals right now and this book had 1 activity to do with fractals.  Anyway I came across a project to make in the book  called &#39;Divisional Circles&#39;.   You cut 8&quot; circles out of cardboard, and then proceed to make 12 notches evenly spaced around the outside, attached a long piece of yarn or string in the middle and then you can wrap the string around the circle by way of the notches to make different designs & shapes.  Well once again my 7 year old took one look at it and wanted a circle with many pieces of yarn attached to use as a frisbee.  Later he and his little brother were pretending they were &#39;Puffles&#39; from Club Penguin and they were playing with them and taking them for walks by using the yarn as leashes:)  I had fun making geometric shapes with the yarn and seeing what other designs I could make as well, and the kids had fun in a whole other way and I was more than o.k. with it.  They&#39;ve been having fun for 3 days with them, and even brought them over to my moms house last night and showed them to my great aunt who is 85 and she even played some frisbee with them while sitting in her chair:)  <br/>\n<br/>\nJulie van der Wekken</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430148316,"authorName":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","from":"&quot;whatismyusername@...&quot; &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt;","profile":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: How do you strew, research, learn and organize activities?","postDate":"1266836189","msgId":51014,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGhsdG5zdCtjMTNoQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGhsNXNkZSs3cmFtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":50825,"nextInTopic":51018,"prevInTime":51013,"nextInTime":51015,"topicId":50727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, All; Thank you very much for all the responses.

I learned to be spontaneous. All of a sudden, I look around and I see many things we can do. But in the past, my mind was fixed on &quot;projects&quot;. The other day, my DS4 was inside a playpen throwing out all the old balloons and I threw them back in. We had lots of fun and I had some workout!<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I was so worried about not doing enough and I was so tense. Now I am more relaxed and try to BE with the children. Lots of time, they just want me to BE there, watching TV, doing things or doing nothing! I have more success following their leads and not imposing the &quot;projects&quot; I had in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Yes, I still need to do &quot;research&quot;. My son and I got into a game called &quot;fireboy and watergirl&quot;. He was fascinated by the pulleys. So I went online and bought pulleys to install on his playhouse. Maybe I can give him a lecture on &quot;physics&quot;. LOL (I think we will play with the pulleys and see what they can do).<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Yes, I still need to find time to read more about unschooling and this list. But when I am confused or consumed, I could hear Sandra&#39;s voice,&quot;hey, go to be with you kids&quot;. I try to remind myself that I could overdo the research part and not do enough being with them (with all my attention and passion).<br/>\n<br/>\n5.

I used to and it made me feel so inadequate. One day I talked to one of these mums and she explained how everything was pre cut, the kids were told exactly how to put things together and only the paint colours they wanted the kids to use were available. It was a real aha moment for me. My children, at those ages really had nothing to show for all their &quot;work&quot;. It was then I realised the massive difference between process and product. While these children were being sent home with a finished product, they had nowhere near the rich experience with paint, glue or whatever that mine did simply because mine weren&#39;t expected to follow my ideas about what to do. I put things out and they sploshed and cut and balled paper etc. Once I realised that for my children process was more important than product I started taking pictures sometimes so I could reassure myself they were doing stuff even if the house was not festooned with finished crafts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow they are 7 and almost 5. The 7 year old is now more interested in the finished product, but of course totally on his terms. Neither of my children has ever been interested in the &quot;today we are going to do x craft for valentines day&quot; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs regards strewing my older DS barely notices strewn things unless it directly relates to his passions of the moment (currently wildlife). I can strew Chinese new year or valentines stuff all I like and it will be ignored. But show him some youtube footage of lions and he&#39;s hooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy younger DS does respond to strewing, but mostly I strew from things that are already in the house eg I&#39;ll leave a couple of books from our own bookshelves on the sofa and he&#39;ll coming running to ask me to read them, or I&#39;ll put playdough and a couple of bits eg a stick or plastic bottle caps or something on the kitchen table and he can be up at the table within seconds of spotting them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have also found that watching what my children respond too when we are out and about in the world helps me think of things to strew. I watched my older son always gravitate to construction toys when we were out so I invested in lego and kapla. My younger son loves destroying things so if I have a cardboard box to break up I&#39;ll ask him to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nAlison<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;whatismyusername@...&quot; &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I found it difficult to find time to &quot;strew&quot; (I am still trying to understand it), research, learn and organize activities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My DS4&#39;s awake time is about 13 hours a day while my DD1&#39;s awake time is about 11 hours a day.

She would do this for two hours at a time, with me<br/>\nsitting in the adjacent room watching and commenting when asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater she got very into vinegar and baking soda &quot;potions&quot; with food coloring<br/>\nor assorted spices - which was a great way to get rid of older spices. I<br/>\nwould lay out some cloth towels on the counter surface to catch the spills<br/>\nand they would go straight to the laundry so it was messy yet easy to clean<br/>\nup.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are crafty websites that will send projects to you via email. I get a<br/>\nweekly craft newsletter from Better Homes and Gardens - for me it&#39;s research<br/>\nand keeping abreast of what&#39;s popular for professional reasons.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bhg.com/crafts/\">http://www.bhg.com/crafts/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also read my green crafting column in Natural Life Magazine<br/>\nwww.naturallifemagazine.com which usually is free on the website.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the idea of creativity - well maybe you will feel called to buy my<br/>\nbook when it is finished and read not only my story (so part memoir), but<br/>\nthose of a bunch of other parents and families who are unschooling and<br/>\nmaking creative and artistic activities one of the foundations of their<br/>\nlives. It will be called &quot;Making, Mending and Mothering&quot; - and folks, your<br/>\nsurvey answers are due! You know who your are. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the crafty stuff, but also pretty much all the other stuff I strew,<br/>\njust arises from our daily life, and my intimate and comprehensive knowledge<br/>\nof the kinds of things Jayn loves. I learn of things that might be<br/>\ninteresting from tv, from other people&#39;s posts here, from walking around the<br/>\nneighborhood, from the internet, from my dh who continually forages for<br/>\ninformation and cool stuff. He is a mercurial man of expansive interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nI save my intentional researching for my writing activities - and this I do<br/>\nwhen Jayn is busy with other people, or sleeping. Right now she is out at a<br/>\nbirthday party - she chose Daddy to go with her instead of me. So I&#39;m about<br/>\nto sign off and get back to work on my next screenplay and the novelization<br/>\nwhich for some reason are coming about concurrently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt sounds like a lot of neediness right now, but as your kids grow there<br/>\nwill be a time when they are off doing other stuff. They will not<br/>\nindependent as young as conventional parenting theories would have you<br/>\nbelieve &quot;should&quot; be the case. But it will happen over time. Successful<br/>\nunschooling demands more of us as parents - more time, more attention, more<br/>\nfocus, more careful thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the rewards are wonderful. Jayn is 10. Last night, springing from a<br/>\ncrafty endeavour of mine, we have decided to create a paper doll/mixed media<br/>\nart calendar for 2011, that we will printing and distributing to our friends<br/>\nas next year&#39;s holiday gift. It was Jayn&#39;s idea and she really is<br/>\nspearheading the planning. It is going to be very cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; No, don&#39;t make the kind of turkey you want to make.<br/>\nDo exactly as we say. Trace your hand with pencil. Go over that<br/>\npencil line with brown. BROWN, not green. ...and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t try this at home.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nOMG no - I hate that.

I am hoping I will get better and better as time goes by.***<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was reading this, several things occurred to me.  The first thing was thinking that maybe you are feeling overly ambitious, then falling short of self expectations.  With really little kids, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of extra that needs doing to thrill and engage if they have toys at the ready and a parent willing to play with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes SEEing what they are doing and how they are learning and growing helps a parent know what to do next or what to add to the mix.  If a kid is gravitating towards legos, get more legos or more building things of a different nature.  If legos seem to be a tactile thing, get more things with interesting textures to work with.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t plan craft activities.  Something that really helped at our house was to have all the craft supplies, that could be used independently, at an easy reach and at the ready for a kid to do it when they felt like it.  As they got older, more things were added to that inventory.  At the very basic there should be access to paper, tape, markers, crayons, pencils, and scissors (depending on the child), or if not scissors some cool paper punch things, and glue if you have a suitable place where a kid can use it with easy clean up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOthers we&#39;ve known have had craft corners in their houses complete with a card table and chairs with craft items all right there, able to be left out and used later.  What we do, is try to keep as many flat surfaces as clean as possible, and then stashed next to our shelves of crafty stuff, we have large pieces of cardboard that can be laid out on the floor.  That is often where painting happened because our kids seemed not to care much about the picture, but more about painting with body parts such as feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot every mom is crafty.  Draw on your strengths and bring those things to your child&#39;s lives.  Chances are, your children may be just the same way you are!  When unschoolers say that unschooling looks different for everyone, this is big part of that!  Some people just aren&#39;t crafty and that&#39;s OK!  Maybe your game shelf will be much much larger than your craft shelf.  If you are somewhat crafty and you just don&#39;t know how to help your kids with it, visit a craft store and just explore all the cool stuff and pick up something that your kids might enjoy, it could be as simple as huge bags of puff balls and pipe cleaners.  That&#39;s VERY easy to set out and VERY easy to clean up after!  Those are the things I call &quot;cheap thrills&quot;, where $5 of fun can be had for literally weeks!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith little ones, maybe, start with small steps.  Bring in one new idea or thing each week.  Perhaps one week, when you go for a walk the next time, take a magnifying glass and look at stuff and collect things.  Maybe the next week, when you are at the a store grab new play dough or ingredients to make it.

For your four year old, it might just mean thinking a little ahead to some fun stuff he&#39;d like to do, or picking up something related to an interest while your out.  Free your mind about things and give them a little twist--like butcher paper on the kitchen table for drawing instead of little pieces of paper, and then everyone can draw together.  Or hanging big paper on the wall.  Cut the butcher paper into strips, tape them together, and make a super long roadway through the whole house, if he likes cars.  Or cut lengths and tape them into tubes big enough for them to crawl through and tape them together to make a tube maze, or just a tunnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my daughter was that age, I&#39;d bought a big tub at a feed store, and she&#39;d bathe outside on the back deck.  I&#39;d fill it with warm water and she loved to spend hours out there having a bubble bath in the litttle bitty tub.  And I raided the kitchen and her toys for fun stuff to play with.  We also did cornstarch and water in a little tub in equal amounts, and then add some food coloring--good for hours of fun even as they are older now!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course there&#39;s homemade playdough, which doesn&#39;t take long to make, but is fun fun fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sandradodd.com/playdough\">http://www.sandradodd.com/playdough</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a gazillion ideas here, in one packed page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren\">http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a whole container of the little gems in a bunch of colors that you would put in a vase with flowers--cheap at the local craft store.  They&#39;ve used those over the years for countless things.  One of the prettiest was when a friend was over, they built a block castle and lined every surface with them in patterns.  It was magical.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake flubber--it&#39;s glue and borax and so magical and easy to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave more fun--&#39;cause however fun way you tweak the world for your four year old, he&#39;ll be delighted!<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;whatismyusername@...&quot; &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I found it difficult to find time to &quot;strew&quot; (I am still trying to understand it), research, learn and organize activities.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My DS4&#39;s awake time is about 13 hours a day while my DD1&#39;s awake time is about 11 hours a day.

Putting a sheet over a table to  <br/>\nmake a tent doesn&#39;t take much organization or logistics.  The sheet  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t even need to be clean. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question was this:<br/>\n&quot; How do you strew, research, learn and organize activities?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStrewing becomes part of the day, and the other stuff does too, when  <br/>\nyou live with your children directly.  I learn things answering their  <br/>\nquestions, or looking things up I&#39;m curious about.  That IS the  <br/>\nresearch.  If other kids are coming over I might organize something  <br/>\nfor them to do--meaning plan something and make sure there&#39;s space and  <br/>\nthat the right toys or materials are available.  (I said &quot;are&quot; though  <br/>\nmy kids are grown now, but still, last night Holly was bringing a new  <br/>\nfriend over and I cleared off a table and straightened up and had  <br/>\nsnacks planned.  They ended up doing something else; she called and  <br/>\nlet me know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"Shira Rocklin","from":"Shira Rocklin &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re:How do you strew, research, learn and organize activities?","postDate":"1266075433","msgId":50733,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNzZDNzI5LjYwOTA5MDFAeWFob28uY2E+"},"prevInTopic":50727,"nextInTopic":50734,"prevInTime":50732,"nextInTime":50734,"topicId":50727,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think I would be considered a creative person, but I still struggle with finding fun things to do.
