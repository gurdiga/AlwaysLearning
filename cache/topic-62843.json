In","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1302542404\">Sounds like you read the string where I asked similar questions about my 10 year old son. Interestingly, since then my son has decreased this on his own.  In fact I can&#39;t remember the last time I said &quot;really??&quot; with a raised eyebrow (to him anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t really make it a point to talk to him other than when he would get mad at me for questioning the validity of a statement, I would talk to him about credibility (I think I tried the lemonade analogy but totally messed it up, we had a pretty good laugh over that one ;&gt;), and how telling one untruth could easily make people assume that he never tells the truth.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may depend on your relationship with your son how easy it is for you to have these kinds of discussions.  If he shuts down it&#39;s probably not worth harming your relationship with him right now.  Maybe you could find a way to casually bring up an example of someone else that made a false statement to you and now you&#39;re not sure if anything he tells you is true, and you could add, &quot;what do you think?  Do you think I should believe him?&quot;.  Of course this could turn in unexpected ways, but the seed will have been planted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do think knowing that others had a similar experience was enough to help me relax a little. I frankly think it&#39;s a 9/10 year old boy thing - they are just trying to establish their place in the big old world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my son does hang around with two kids that are &quot;schooled&quot;, one traditionally and the other homeschooled (school at home).  Both parented in a very &quot;traditional&quot; way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI overheard many a conversation where these boys were one upping my son at every turn.  It pained me and I usually talked about it to my son after the fact (and amazingly he never did the one upmanship thing).  But I&#39;m sure this may have influenced my son&#39;s need to appear to have all the answers. If your son was in school I bet this influence is even stronger with him, so you may need to give him a little slack - it make take a little while for him to realize he doesn&#39;t have to prove himself all the time.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck and try to talk to him about it without too much judgement.  My son will always let me know when I&#39;m crossing that line ;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n--Melissa<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;nalmeida12&quot; &lt;nalmeida12@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My 9 year old son has been bragging about accomplishments that aren&#39;t true.
