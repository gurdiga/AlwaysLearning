Inadvertantly.<br/>\n  &gt; I&#39;m glad there are a few other voices so I&#39;m not alone.

But like you I can not stomache the thought <br/>\n  &gt; of &quot;do whatever works for your family&quot;<br/>\n  &gt; Why even have Unschooling as a concept if we&#39;re just goint to tell <br/>\n  &gt; everyone that line of BS.<br/>\n  &gt; It&#39;s not right that they&#39;ve ousted the clearest voice on the planet <br/>\n  &gt; about unschooling (Yes, Sandra)<br/>\n  &gt; and the voices that have taken over are giving lousy advice to people.<br/>\n  &gt; Ren<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  Would any of you hardcore unschoolers who live in WA<br/>\n  want to join the WAUNSCHOOLERS list and tell me if<br/>\n  they are *really* unschoolers?  They are talking about <br/>\n  curriculum books and asking the kids to do a page or <br/>\n  two in a book every day and trying to figure out ways <br/>\n  to teach math,,,,&quot;so the kids don&#39;t fall behind&quot;, etc,,, <br/>\n<br/>\n  I joined that list since I live in WA and wanted to learn all<br/>\n  I can about unschooling,,,,but the list seems more of a <br/>\n  place to plan and do field trips with other homeschoolers <br/>\n  than a place to learn about unschooling.  They have set <br/>\n  times to go to the children&#39;s museum, set times to go to<br/>\n  a thing in Renton called FLIGHT (FLIGHT means Families <br/>\n  Learning In God&#39;s Honor Together. It is a very large <br/>\n  homeschooling co-op comprising some 180+ families <br/>\n  representing more than 30 churches/faiths etc.  They <br/>\n  go there, separate the kids by age and then send them <br/>\n  off to classrooms to do age appropriate activities),,,etc <br/>\n  It all seems very scheduled and not very *unschool* like<br/>\n  to me.  One newbie to the group got slammed on the <br/>\n  list for questioning FLIGHT and saying it didn&#39;t sound <br/>\n  like unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The owner of the list even said that she thinks society <br/>\n  would crumble to pieces without public school!  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\n  be questioning any of this if their name was <br/>\n  WAHomeschoolers or WAFieldTripsforHomeschoolers, <br/>\n  but their name is WAUNSCHOOLERS! (so it seems kind<br/>\n  of misleading).<br/>\n<br/>\n  On the other hand, I&#39;m still new to all this, so maybe<br/>\n  I&#39;m not informed enough about unschooling to make<br/>\n  comments about something not seeming very<br/>\n  unschooling-like.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Andrea Kim :-)<br/>\n  Mommy to two sweeties!<br/>\n  Laura (2/16/96) & Allison (8/31/99)<br/>\n  Kent, WA,,,,,,,,soon to be Seattle!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
