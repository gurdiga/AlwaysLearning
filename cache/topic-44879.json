I have tried talking with him<br/>\nafter the fact when we have both calmed down.  I have tried talking with him<br/>\nin general long after the fact to see if it being less fresh would help the<br/>\ncommunication process. It seems like nothing works.  He insists that the way<br/>\nhe acts is our fault as if he has no control over what he says or does.<br/>\nAlmost as if we are puppeteers.  <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~ Do you think he deschooled enough? Ten years of schooling takes time <br/>\nto overcome; it takes longer for some kids than others.~~~<br/>\nI am not sure that there is a point in which deschooling stopped.  I mean,<br/>\nto me deschooling is a period of time in which the family is getting past<br/>\nthe schooling time and more used to being a family that spends more time<br/>\ntogether (building the relationship back) before getting started in some<br/>\nother form of homeschooling.  Deschooling for us just gradually turned into<br/>\nunschooling and really looked much the same.if not exactly the same.<br/>\n <br/>\n~~~Is he intense?

This isn&#39;t a snide question. I&#39;m just <br/>\nwondering what your view of respect is and whether he might be <br/>\nmisinterpreting it.~~~<br/>\nWell, let&#39;s see.  I try to treat him as I would want to be treated - as I<br/>\ntreat my friends and family and strangers: speaking respectfully, gently<br/>\ninstead of yelling, demanding, demeaning. Asking his opinion, what he<br/>\nwants/needs and honoring differences of opinion and doing what I can to meet<br/>\nhis needs.  Asking for help in doing various things and being okay with an<br/>\nanswer of no.  I am not sure if he is misinterpreting or not.<br/>\n <br/>\n~~~ I wonder sometimes if <br/>\npeople think that unschooling will automatically create always <br/>\nrespectful, happy, peaceful children.~~~<br/>\nWow, this would be great!  if there could be a guaranteed way to have this<br/>\nresult.dreamy!  <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~ More BEing with, more <br/>\npresence, more understanding, more help.

This may be way off the mark--I don&#39;t know--but I&#39;m wondering if your son could be feeling a deep anger about having too much responsibility for his own life.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said that he seemed to change after his baby brother was about a year old.  I&#39;m wondering if, as he got a sense of his brother&#39;s emerging independence surrounded by nurturing support, if he became angry that he wasn&#39;t receiving that same level of connected support?  Everything you&#39;ve said about him was in terms of &quot;his&quot; choice.  Did you put too much choice on his 10 year old little shoulders?  I&#39;ve met families that have interpreted the radical unschooling message as everything being the child&#39;s choice, and I&#39;ve seen children who had a sort of anxiety (that I interpreted as being caused by too much responsibility) that made them treat parents very disrespectfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow was your transition to radical unschooling?  A conversation that happened not too long ago here about autonomy helped cause the biggest shift for me in seeing that things really need to happen in connected partnership.  Seeing children as an autonomous island is not helpful to them--it can cause them to feel fearful down deep and then react outwardly in some of the ways you&#39;ve described.  It seems to be pretty common, though, with families coming to radical unschooling with children older than babies.  Could your son be feeling some inner insecurity that is driving his behavior?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen children &quot;acting out&quot; to try to get their parents attention (including my own when we threw away the rules and declared ourselves unschoolers--LOL).  It&#39;s my theory that this is what some people observe when they think that children crave boundaries and limits.  I think there is some truth to this, but not in the usual authoritarian sense.  I think they are craving connection and guidance.  Not the kind of connection where you ask them what they want intellectually--I mean the deeper kind where you just know.  And the fact that you have no intuitive sense of what could be going on for him is what is making me wonder why he feels like an isolated island.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot; When we first started being more respectful parents then unschooling, I made<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; a point to apologize to Seth about how disrespectful I had been prior to and<br/>\n&gt; that I would work very hard at being respectful.  I don&#39;t know of anything I<br/>\n&gt; have said or done that would have put a wedge between us or made him feel<br/>\n&gt; like an outsider.  If I have inadvertently done so, I wish someone (he or<br/>\n&gt; anyone else) would point it out to me.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Do you still feel apologetic towards him?  Maybe you set up a dynamic where you feel like you are still &quot;making it up to him,&quot; or like you deserve his disrespectful treatment.  Are you meeting his disrespect genuinely in the moment, or are you trying to be some idea in your head of the perfect unschooling mom reacting in some perfect way?  Have you lost the part of yourself as a parent that sets the tone in your house by accommodating his anger?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if you are spending so much time trying to figure it out that you are not taking steps with him to create more actual peace?  He may be waiting for you to re-emerge as a leader in this area.  My son can tend toward emotional wallowing, and he depends on me to be the &quot;kick in the pants&quot; voice to help him get unstuck when it&#39;s really time to be thinking about moving on.

This isn&#39;t the Geneva conference.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCaren wrote something that applies beautiful to what you&#39;ve written with regards to &quot;agreements to be respectful&quot; and other mentions of agreements and discussions. I think it might help for you to reread her writing.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Before I knew of radical unschooling, I read &quot;Positive Discipline&quot;<br/>\nand tried the techniques from that book. I learned some through that,<br/>\nbut one thing we did over and over (and I didn&#39;t even see it at the<br/>\ntime) was hold &quot;Family Meetings&quot; where I went in with a specific<br/>\nagenda, and manipulated the discussion so it would go &quot;my way&quot;. My<br/>\nhusband would want a clean house when he came home from work, so there<br/>\nwere agreements to clean before he came home, which were rarely upheld.<br/>\nThere was no room for &quot;I don&#39;t want to clean, how can we address this?&quot;<br/>\nWe were all miserable. No one was being honest - we were trying to be<br/>\nkind to each other, but still get &quot;our way&quot;. (Man! I am SO grateful we<br/>\nfound radical unschooling!!) I pushed my family into giving up TV this<br/>\nway - but they all agreed, right? They agreed because it&#39;s what Mama<br/>\nwanted, and they knew they weren&#39;t free to disagree. (not proud of that)&quot;<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you ever agreed to something when you were calm and not been able to keep that agreement when things are stressful? An agreement to be respectful seems both vague and potential massive. How do you deal with anger and intensity if you have to uphold your agreement to be respectful? If you are in a heated moment is it truly helpful to you if someone says &quot;remember our agreement to be respectful&quot;? <br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of what you write seems like you have very formal discussions. That may not be the case, I recognize that this format lends itself to more formal writing. So what your writen about discussions about school may falsely sound as though you are sitting down to a family discussion when in practice the discussions were actually happening while you were driving somewhere or while you both were doing something else and the conversation just arose. If discussions here get too formal it becomes a bit like a principal talking to a student, I am the one with the power and Simon or Linnaea are squirming under my powerful gaze. They agree with me and my goals in part because I&#39;m really good at framing my words. It is much better if I mention something in passing, or talk about it when something else is going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote that he first wanted to unschool for only a year and then decided to take it on as a permanent thing. I ask Simon and Linnaea, every once in a while, if they want to go to school. I want them to make that choice. I want them to know that they are doing this staying out of school thing because they are choosing to. I would miss them and this life if they did choose to go to school, but I will adjust to give them what they want. And if they change their mind about school if they ever decide to go, I&#39;ll be happy to make that adjustment too. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are holding him accountable to agreements in a way that isn&#39;t going to help either of you to get along. I think you are trying to fix too many things with words. There is probably nothing you can say that will make him feel good about his brother or his sister. There is probably nothing that you can say that will make him feel better. But there are things you can do. You said when he felt like he wasn&#39;t getting enough time with friends you worked to make that less of an issue. Instead of talking about things with him, work to make things better. Give him more time when you can. Sit with him while he plays games, help him to feel more connected with you. Don&#39;t worry about his relationship with his brother, do what you can to not let them be alone together. If Aden wants to hang out with Seth, you be there too. If Seth doesn&#39;t want Aden around, then make sure that he has his space from Aden. See if you can get time to do stuff just you and<br/>\n Seth. Ask Chet to watch Aden and Emma and go out to a movie with Seth or do something else that he might enjoy. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t spend time looking for what made it all go wrong, look for ways to make it better now. Make sure that you are offering him food at regular intervals, and not verbally, bring him food he likes. Make sure you are offering him things to do that are interesting for him and aren&#39;t about tagging along on something more about entertaining a 4 year old. Have his friends over more. If he is more pleasant when he&#39;s out, go out with him more. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou wrote: <br/>\nYes, Seth has a stepdad whom has been his main/only father figure.  I think<br/>\nit is somewhat of a factor but I think the bigger factor is I think he feels<br/>\nlike we have started over with our own family even though we have done<br/>\neverything in our power to not distinguish/make it seem that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut you&#39;ve also written a couple of times that he isn&#39;t being a part of the<br/>\nfamily. It means that whatever you are doing to distinguish that isn&#39;t working. You are feeling like he isn&#39;t acting like a part of your family. I don&#39;t know that I understand how that works. Simon sometimes plays video games and listens to Harry Potter books on cd or ipod and is kind of out of the main family loop. So I make the loop bigger and go and hang out where he is. I make sure that I touch him and sit with him and chat with him and be with him. I find something that he wants to do with me, or I do with him what he is doing. And I bring him food and drink. I include him in my day. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are absolutely right - this is what I am desperately trying to<br/>\naccomplish.everybody having fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nand <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nothers rights to safety<br/>\nand happiness are being stomped on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that everybody having fun is outside of your ability. Everybody having fun is something that you can encourage and support, but it is their own choice and ability that makes it so. And while I think that people have a right to be safe in their own home, they don&#39;t have a right to happiness. In the U.S. you can argue they have the right to the pursuit of happiness, but not actually to attaining that happiness. Helping everybody to feel safe is a good thing. Helping to make the members of your family have things they enjoy doing and going to places they like to go and finding new things that might also be good to do, those things fall within your remit. But making sure that the outcome is happiness or fun, that is outside of what you can do. It might help to recognize your own limitations. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"katherand@gmail.com","from":"katherand@...","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Radical Unschooling Let Down","postDate":"1242155241","msgId":44945,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU0OTY4ZjBhMTRmMmUwNWFmYTVhNDJmZWEyMDYyYTViQGdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY0MTQwOThBNUMxNzRENDlBQjI2N0E2MDFENDhENTUwQExZTEFMQVAyPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwM2YwMWM5ZDMyMiQyMjk3YzNkMCQ2N2M3NGI3MCRAbmV0PiA8ODIwMTFDNEEtMTIxQi00MDQ1LTg4N0UtNTkyN0FCQThDRTBCQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NjQxNDA5OEE1QzE3NEQ0OUFCMjY3QTYwMUQ0OEQ1NTBATFlMQUxBUDI+"},"prevInTopic":44944,"nextInTopic":44946,"prevInTime":44944,"nextInTime":44946,"topicId":44879,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... nuclear family to whom they feel connected and by whom they feel loved and seen is very very valuable.

We talked<br/>\na lot about what unschooling is and how he would stay &quot;caught up&quot; in case he<br/>\nwanted to go back to school at some point.

He realized that he used math quite a bit in daily<br/>\nlife and his fears were absolved.  The end of the year we talked about him<br/>\nreturning to school and he was happy being at home.  A year later he talked<br/>\nabout wanting to go back to school and upon discussing why he wanted to, it<br/>\nwas to hang out with his friends more.  When we discussed it further he<br/>\ndecided against going to school because he wouldn&#39;t really be hanging out<br/>\nwith them.

The only<br/>\n&#39;riding&#39; I can think of that I *might* be doing or that he might consider<br/>\nbeing riding is trying to protect Aden and the rest of the family from his<br/>\nbullying (physical for Aden, mental/emotional with us).  As respectfully as<br/>\nI can talk with him and explain how it feels when he does things and remind<br/>\nhim of our agreements to be respectful.  He has had free reign since we<br/>\nstarted unschooling.  We went more radical soon after the first RE<br/>\nconference we attended the September after his 5th grade year (he was 11 by<br/>\nthen - July bday).  <br/>\n <br/>\n~~~ This also sounds like you made the decision and your son didn&#39;t.~~~<br/>\nIt was a joint decision with much discussion.  He knows he has the choice to<br/>\nreturn to school if he wants, he knows he has the choice to do what he<br/>\nwants.

If <br/>\nyou were forced to give an explanation, what would you say?

We had a pretty good relationship then, only really<br/>\nstrained when school/homework was brought into the picture.  I did parent<br/>\ndifferently - more mainstream and less respectful but it never felt right,<br/>\njust didn&#39;t know other options at the time.<br/>\nWhen his stepdad and I got together, Seth loved him and there was this<br/>\ninstant bond.  It didn&#39;t take as long as I thought it would for Seth to want<br/>\nto call Chet &quot;Dad&quot; and we never pushed it - it was his idea.  We had started<br/>\nchanging our parenting style to being more respectful of him and his<br/>\nneeds/wants.  It was a gradual process but it allowed for us to step out of<br/>\nour own way more when we discovered we discovered we were pregnant.  We<br/>\ninvolved Seth as much as he wanted to be involved - he even named his<br/>\nbrother.  I made a vow that Seth would never have to watch Aden like so many<br/>\nother families just automatically require of older siblings.  When Chet and<br/>\nI got married, it was really a family thing where we all took vows together<br/>\n(lots of talking and making sure Seth was okay with it prior to doing it).<br/>\nWe were not in a financial position for me to quit work and bring Seth home<br/>\nuntil very late in my pregnancy.  We had been talking with him about the<br/>\noption because he was miserable in school.  He was being bullied almost<br/>\ndaily, in trouble daily for talking in class (because he finished his work<br/>\nand was bored), homework was a battle every night and took forever to<br/>\ncomplete because of the struggle - not the difficulty.  Then I thought I<br/>\n*had* to leave him in school for the rest of the year (It was winter break<br/>\nwhen I was able to come home and in hind-sight could have brought him home<br/>\nthen, but again I didn&#39;t realize I could).  Anyway, things seemed to be<br/>\ngoing well after Aden was born until he was about a year old.  Then Seth<br/>\nstarted getting annoyed with him easily and progressively getting more and<br/>\nmore mean with him and us.<br/>\nWe have tried to have discussions with Seth over the years in which we were<br/>\ncompletely open to listen and try to figure out what could help us all be<br/>\nhappy and respect each other but Seth shuts down and won&#39;t talk with us or<br/>\nhe will seem to tell us what he thinks we want to hear, we all agree to work<br/>\ntogether and a week later its back to the same thing.  After a more recent<br/>\nblow-up I asked him why he thinks he is so unhappy in our family and he just<br/>\nshrugged his shoulders and mumbled, &quot;I dunno.&quot;  I shared my theory and he<br/>\nsaid, &quot;maybe subconsciously.&quot;  He wouldn&#39;t elaborate or say anything more.<br/>\nI am not sure what else to share about this regarding your questions.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Utmost Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nFunschooling Mom to Seth (14) , Aden (4) & Emma (born 8/13/08)<br/>\nFunloving Wife to Chet (7/4/04) <br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/\">http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; Abundant Curiosity<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/</a>&gt; Funschooling Young Individuals:<br/>\nFYI-OKC<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/</a>&gt; OKC Metro Teen Group - OAHAT<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What good is it for children to have their own particular parents<br/>\n if the parents are going to treat those individual children<br/>\n as generic pegs to be stuck into generic holes?&quot;<br/>\n  ~ Sandra Dodd from:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.weirdunsocializedhomeschoolers.com/2009/03/homeschooling-styles-\">http://www.weirdunsocializedhomeschoolers.com/2009/03/homeschooling-styles-</a><br/>\nunschooling.html&gt; Sandra&#39;s Guest Blog Post<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAFFIRMATION: I am whole, well and unlimited.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny C","from":"&quot;Jenny C&quot; &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Radical Unschooling Let Down","postDate":"1242146001","msgId":44927,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGd1YzhjaCt0cWVlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDE3NGRmOWRjMDkwNTEyMDgwNmgzMGZmYTliOHU0ZjI3NDQ5NmYwNjRlZTgxQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":44926,"nextInTopic":44932,"prevInTime":44926,"nextInTime":44928,"topicId":44879,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... respect his ... the ... than ... not ...

We had<br/>\nalready decided that I would stay home and had been talking about<br/>\nhomeschooling my oldest (then 10 years old).  One of my friends mentioned<br/>\nthat she unschooled so we talked about it and I did &#39;the research&#39; and<br/>\ndecided that unschooling was the path for us.  I was relieved that I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have to nag him about homework anymore, that there would be no more<br/>\ntrips to the principal&#39;s office, and especially the promise of a better<br/>\nrelationship with my son because it would be based on mutual respect and<br/>\nexploration.<br/>\nI pulled him out of school after 5th grade.  We started with the typical<br/>\ndeschooling while I kept wrapping my head around all that unschooling meant,<br/>\nespecially radical unschooling.  We attended the Rethinking Education<br/>\nconference that September and David Albert and many others were a huge help<br/>\nwith making our transition into the more radical unschooling.  We went the<br/>\nnext year as well and he went to the Not Back To School Camp last year.<br/>\nWe will have been unschooling 4 years the end of this month.  Most of the<br/>\ntime he is in his room to play video games, computer stuff, read, play<br/>\nguitar, write various short stories, sleeping most of the day, awake most of<br/>\nthe night.  When he is not doing that he is rehearsing for whatever<br/>\nproduction he is in (acting, musicals, improv), playing laser tag, or<br/>\nskateboarding.  Most of which one would think I am complaining about or<br/>\nseeking ways of how to change.  No, it&#39;s not.  He is a brilliant person and<br/>\nthe way he chooses to spend his time doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>\nWhat bothers me is that despite us doing everything we can to support him in<br/>\nwhat he wants to do, despite us inviting him to help plan and/or participate<br/>\nin family activities, despite us respecting his choices.there have not been<br/>\nvery many moments of *mutual* respect.  There have been countless moments of<br/>\nmy oldest son tormenting his younger brother - &quot;because he&#39;s f****ing<br/>\nannoying.&quot;  There have been countless times of him yelling at us and even<br/>\npunching holes in the walls because we are &quot;doing __________ to piss him<br/>\noff.&quot;  <br/>\nHe essentially refuses to be a part of the family and carries on with this<br/>\nair of entitlement that he should be able to do and say what he wants<br/>\nwhenever he wants regardless of what anyone else needs, already has planned,<br/>\nor money involved.  He refuses to take responsibility for his words or<br/>\nactions.  He refuses to do anything with or for the family.  All of this<br/>\ndespite the fact that since his birth I have modeled doing things for others<br/>\nand taking our own responsibility.  He will even comment when others don&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest part of this is that when he is out in the world with others, I<br/>\nhear about how great of a kid he is.  He REALLY IS a great person and I LOVE<br/>\nhearing about it.  But since starting this unschooling journey he has been<br/>\ntreating his family in a bully-like way instead of with mutual respect like<br/>\nhe treats others outside our family.  I am really feeling like radical<br/>\nunschooling has not been good for him/our family at all and I really don&#39;t<br/>\nlike that feeling.  I really want this to work but we can&#39;t be bullied any<br/>\nlonger.we can&#39;t live tip-toeing around what he thinks he is entitled to.<br/>\nThe only thing I see to do is pull in the reigns and it is paining me to<br/>\nfeel like I failed him and our family by making the choice to radically<br/>\nunschool.<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what I want or don&#39;t want to hear from you all.  I might just<br/>\nbe venting but I just can&#39;t take this life anymore.  I can&#39;t watch him be so<br/>\nmean to his brother, talk so hateful to me or my dh, essentially make our<br/>\nlives hell.  <br/>\nI don&#39;t expect or even want some fairy tale life, just a life in which we<br/>\ncan all be happy and peaceful more often than not. A life in which his<br/>\nlittle brother isn&#39;t afraid of him walking in the room, a life in which we<br/>\ncan all breathe easier and not worry about the next shoe dropping.  A life<br/>\nwhere the respect is mutual, not just one sided.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nWith Utmost Gratitude,<br/>\nChristy Putnam<br/>\nFunschooling Mom to Seth (14) , Aden (4) & Emma (born 8/13/08)<br/>\nFunloving Wife to Chet (7/4/04) <br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/\">http://abundantcuriosity.blogspot.com/</a>&gt; Abundant Curiosity<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FYI-OKC/</a>&gt; Funschooling Young Individuals:<br/>\nFYI-OKC<br/>\n &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OAHAT/</a>&gt; OKC Metro Teen Group - OAHAT<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;What good is it for children to have their own particular parents<br/>\n if the parents are going to treat those individual children<br/>\n as generic pegs to be stuck into generic holes?&quot;<br/>\n  ~ Sandra Dodd from:<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.weirdunsocializedhomeschoolers.com/2009/03/homeschooling-styles-\">http://www.weirdunsocializedhomeschoolers.com/2009/03/homeschooling-styles-</a><br/>\nunschooling.html&gt; Sandra&#39;s Guest Blog Post<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAFFIRMATION: I am whole, well and unlimited.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45117,"nextTopicId":44861}}
