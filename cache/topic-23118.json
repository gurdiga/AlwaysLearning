My <br/>\nname is Darlene Navarre, 33 (until Oct 21) I am totally (most of the <br/>\ntime) happily married to Blake, 45 and we have 5 children (first 3 from <br/>\nprevious marriage): Danyell, 17 Marc, 14 Breeana 10, Mitchel 5 and <br/>\nCarter 3. For the time we live in Las Vegas, NV. <br/>\n <br/>\nI started home school (the yucky blucky way) or what I like to call the <br/>\nnot-learning way 9 years ago. I was a control freak and my children <br/>\nwere rebelling.<br/>\n <br/>\nI knew instinctively that this way of teaching did NOT feel right or <br/>\nlogical and I am a very logical simplistic thinker. Yet what to do? Then <br/>\n3 years ago I got the &quot;Unschooling Handbook&quot; read 2 chapters and I was <br/>\nhooked. My husband was not. We fought and fought for now 3 years over <br/>\n&quot;schooling&quot;. My son that is 14 opted to go to high school and my 10 year <br/>\ndaughter wanted to go to elementary. I believe it was do to the fact <br/>\nthat they were confused and felt in the middle of a battle. (I don&#39;t <br/>\nblame them). <br/>\n <br/>\nIn March Mitchel, turned 5 and my husband convinced me to put him in a <br/>\ncharter home program through the district. I hated it right away and <br/>\nMitchel felt forced to do something he already knew. Mitchel is very very <br/>\nbright person, he loves to draw and play with numbers in his head , <br/>\ntell made-up stories, make books with drawings and story line etc.... I <br/>\nknew I had to be aggressive or else he could lose his creativity, just as <br/>\nmy 3 older ones seem to have. I read the whole unschooling handbook, <br/>\npleaded with my husband and unenrolled M from charter program.The more I read about unschooling, the more I learn, the more I talk about life <br/>\nlearning, the more my husband does well with it. (finally) <br/>\n <br/>\nHe should already know what a free thinker I am and if only I (who <br/>\nmissed so much school and eventually dropped out pregnant at 16) would have <br/>\nbeen given this freedom to learn I could have accomplished so much <br/>\nmore. (no regrets just lessons) <br/>\n <br/>\nYou know its amazing that people make a BIG issue out of just everyday <br/>\nstuff. I had my last baby at home just husband, kids and I, why go to a <br/>\nhospital? I still (and will remain until their ready  to stop) breast <br/>\nfeed my 5 and 3 year old and would not dream of it any other, why does <br/>\nanyone want to get up and make a bottle or all the other complicated <br/>\nstuff involved with bottle? Sleeping arrangements are sleep with mom and <br/>\ndad until your ready (I would be happy if they slept with me until they <br/>\nleft the house), why spend the time or money on extra rooms and cribs? <br/>\nI feed 2 little ones (by their up bring and choice) only raw fruits and <br/>\nveggies, why heat up a house or use the electricity when you don&#39;t need <br/>\nto? <br/>\n <br/>\nMy new discovery or pot of logical gold: Do we force a child to walk <br/>\nand talk or run? Is that not learning? Why I did not see the common and <br/>\nlogical sense of children learning on their own long ago? I could just <br/>\nkick myself but all I can do now is give them ALL the knowledge I have <br/>\nacquired and ask the older 3 to forgive me and hope that they learn from <br/>\nmom&#39;s mistakes. <br/>\n <br/>\nI Love myself more for learning the lessons once again. The ones that I <br/>\nknew so long ago when I begged my mom to let me stay at home and just <br/>\nlet me choose how, why and the wheres of learning. <br/>\n <br/>\nThank you all of your time and care,<br/>\nPeace and Love,<br/>\nDarlene<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nYahoo! for Good<br/>\n Click here to donate to the Hurricane Katrina relief effort. <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23113,"nextTopicId":23121}}
