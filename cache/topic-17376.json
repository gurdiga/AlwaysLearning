If that piece of <br/>\npaper called a diploma is important to you, then you will ultimately <br/>\nhave to pay someone to evaluate whatever credits you have <br/>\naccumulated, from all sources, for them to issue you that diploma.  <br/>\nColleges are in the diploma business.  They expect you to pay for <br/>\nthat piece of paper that they issue.  Hence I would sure do some <br/>\nshopping around to see who is willing to do this for the least amount <br/>\nof money.  But even if you had to spend $1500 + the $700 to earn the <br/>\ncredits from passing various tests, you would still be lightyears <br/>\nahead of any other 4-year accredited college expenses.  And you get <br/>\nto do it on your own time, on your own terms.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if the diploma isn&#39;t so important, like if you are going on to <br/>\ngrad school, for example, then you just submit your credits, <br/>\nespecially those GRE exams, and keep going until you have completed <br/>\nwhatever degree satisfies your personal goals.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if the job you want doesn&#39;t necessarily require the diploma, just <br/>\nthe college credits, a transcript, that you can put together <br/>\nyourself, just like the high school one I put together for my <br/>\ndaugther, listing what you have done to complete whatever you have <br/>\ncompleted that is college level work, could suffice.  Same goes for <br/>\nthe portfolio assessments, the internships, and the independent study <br/>\ncourses.  Then your employer might be willing to foot the bill to do <br/>\nwhatever is necessary to get you that diploma.  Especially if you do <br/>\nyour job well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more details and all the possible options do get Brad Voeller&#39;s <br/>\nbook, Accelerated Distance Learning.
