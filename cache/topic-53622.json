Not sure if it was someone from this list but thought I&#39;d put that out there.<br/>\nOne quote was:<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t mean lack of guidance by an adult, if fact quite the opposite. It means using everyday experience to educate--not using a classroom setting. So in effect going to the supermarket is a field trip--you can teach nutrition, math, pricing schemes, calorie and calorie intake, biology, pharmacology, baking (depends on the store), even the cycle of how food gets to market--fruit, vegetable and meat and packaged goods.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling uses the world as a classroom. It expects the child to be curious and interested in discovery. Parents actually use this methodology every day...they just don&#39;t recognize that they are doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother quote:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think &quot;unschoolers&quot; are actually the most disciplined of parents as they view everything they and their children do as a total learning experience and work in what others expect schools to do--they are, if they are any good, the ultimate educators. I do homeschool and use the technique (as all parents do) but it&#39;s actually very hard work LOL (for the parent, not the child :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that comment saying unschooler parents are the &quot;ultimate educators&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabi<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Simon and Linnaea like cheetos, and we have to get them imported. Fortunately we&#39;ve met a woman whose husband is in the USAF and she can get us cheetos from the base. But I bet they trade a good orange for cheetos every time. Oranges are hard though. When they are good, man, yumm, but if they aren&#39;t ripe enough or if they are too insipid tasting, well, they need punch and flavour and goodness. Cheetos are the same pretty much every time. Although the curly ones that look like pigs&#39; tails they aren&#39;t so flavourful, they&#39;re just novel. They wouldn&#39;t trade picking strawberries and eating them for cheetos, they wouldn&#39;t trade David&#39;s risotto for cheetos. But this woman would, right? So clearly her junk food versus good food outlook has worked a treat. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Last night at dance class one of the musicians brought little baklavas in. And one of the dancers talked about how she has an unhealthy obsession with sweet things. Linnaea and I had just been talking about loving food in the car on the way to class. She was talking about how much she enjoys eating good food. David had bought a couple of cheap chickens from the grocery store to cook up for the cats and the dog and Linnaea had tried some of the meat and said it was flavourless. We get free range chickens from the butcher normally. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what got her thinking about food and enjoying food. Both she and Simon are doing their own food explorations and discoveries and have their own relationships with what they eat. I got little mini chocolate covered doughnuts yesterday and Simon grabbed them and ran for the computer with them when we got home. With both David and I sneaking quite a few and Linnaea a few less the tub of 30 little doughnuts still has<br/>\n&gt;  9 in it, but of the 18 bagels I made 2 days ago, there are 2 left. No unhealthy obsession, just a healthy joy in the taste and the pleasure and the energy given.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Food is such a wonderful aspect of life. Sharing it, creating it, growing it, killing it, buying it, exploring it, just this huge wonderful experience. Labelling it as something fearful and worthy of huge rules and barriers and boundaries just screws it all up. Why would anyone want to torture themselves over something so fantastic as a honey and nut and filo pastry morsel? Or a cheeto?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Schuyler<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ________________________________<br/>\n&gt; From: Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt; Sent: Friday, 30 April, 2010 1:53:09<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Maybe those unschoolers are onto something, after all.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-***And even if they are, well, any<br/>\n&gt; kid worth his salt will figure out how to trade the orange for the<br/>\n&gt; Cheetos in a heartbeat.&quot;***-=-<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; What gets me about this is that she&#39;s basically saying any child who  <br/>\n&gt; did NOT want Cheetohs would be... what, a wimp?

It&#39;s one of the reasons I stopped  <br/>\nworking out with a particular trainer. I was going to the gym to feel  <br/>\nstronger and to boost my stamina (which I&#39;ve done). She wanted me to  <br/>\nfeel really guilty about the food I was eating. She&#39;s a triathlete  <br/>\nbesides being a trainer, so is completely obsessive about food. Not a  <br/>\nsession went by without her talking about it. It had the opposite  <br/>\neffect on me; I didn&#39;t eat better.

I had never liked pears because they were so gritty. Not to mention that when I was a kid my mom only bought a limited variety of fruits, the ones she liked, and told me I was being ridiculous for not liking it. I&#39;ll never get over missing out on honeydew melon until I was probably in my 30s because my mom wouldn&#39;t buy it. She only bought cantaloupe, which I can&#39;t stand, because she didn&#39;t like honeydew, which I have since discovered is one of my favorite fruits. I assumed they tasted the same since they were both melons. But I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce I started eating fruit only when it was in season, though, I discovered that almost every fruit does taste good. Well, I still can&#39;t swallow cantaloupe or bananas (my mother&#39;s other favorite fruit...hmmm, I see an unhealthy connection here). I love pears now and honeydew melons, like I said.

My other grandfather was 96 when he died and his wife is now 98.  They all cooked with butter, ate biscuits at every meal, ate butterbeans and other veggies cooked to death in butter, lots of fried chicken etc... I loved going to eat at their houses, the food had so much buttery flavor (which i like), I rarely ate the desserts, cause although they were good, the main dish was better.<br/>\n3 of my great aunts lived together most of their lives, they took care of their brother and only one learned to drive.  When he died and she had a stroke so she couldnt drive anymore they went to live with a health nut of a great aunt.  She wouldnt let them cook anymore, said they used too much butter and salt and cooked everything bland and tasteless.  They hated it but it was her house.  <br/>\nLater when one started having health problems the dr. said she wasnt getting enough fat and sodium. Their diet had practically no fat or salt in it anymore.<br/>\nMy sister and I would try to visit and when we did we brought them pizza, they loved it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279647515,"authorName":"Deb Lewis","from":"&quot;Deb Lewis&quot; &lt;d.lewis@...&gt;","profile":"deborahkmlewis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Maybe those unschoolers are onto something, after all.&quot;","postDate":"1272635905","msgId":53643,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlEOUJENEQ1Q0UwRTRENUE4QTJDODUxREU2NzAzODUyQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPg==","referencesHeader":"PEJDNUQxM0NELTZBRTgtNDlBOC1CQ0JFLUQ5NzNDNjFFRTUyOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDI1MjcyMC42Mjg2NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8QkI1RjYxRjktMDhBQi00NENFLUExN0QtOUIzMTc2MDAyMzEwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NzgzMTMuMjU1NTgucW1Ad2ViODYyMDMubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53639,"nextInTopic":53644,"prevInTime":53642,"nextInTime":53644,"topicId":53622,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I loved Cheetos when I was little.

Maybe they weren&#39;t available in our little town but probably it was a grocery budget thing.  But my great aunt loved them and when we would go see her I&#39;d get Cheetos.  She was blind and lived with my mom&#39;s sister.  She was old.  She sat all day and burped and made quilts or braided rugs.  I was fascinated by her, she had mysterious, milky eyes and she never got hollered at when she belched, even at the dinner table.   She kept a bag a Cheetos in her nightstand drawer and she&#39;d share them with me.  She&#39;d say, &quot;lets go work on my rug,&quot; which meant, &quot;Come eat Cheetos in my room.&quot;    <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen she died I was so sad because I knew it would be end of the Cheetos.  People thought I was grief stricken and they told me lots of stories about her and I&#39;m glad about that because I wouldn&#39;t have known much about her otherwise, but what I was really grief stricken about was the loss of my beloved Cheetos. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how long my old aunt had been eating Cheetos but she was ninety six when she died.    The aunt who took care of her is now ninety two.  She pours cream on everything, eats a big bowl of potato chips every day, has a little Irish cream in her coffee in the morning and a little wine in the evening, eats chocolate and cooks with butter.   My mom&#39;s eighty eight.  Those old girls just keep on living and it&#39;s hard to get worked up about Cheetos or anything else when you know longevity and health have to do with a lot more than food. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a really long time Dylan liked potato chips.  We&#39;d buy bags and bags of them and he&#39;d eat potato chips every day.  He especially loved the salt and vinegar kind.   He still likes chips but he has them once in awhile now.   He&#39;ll take a nice, tarty green apple anytime.    He was like that with Mountain Dew too, loved it and drank it every day.  He much prefers water these days, though he still sometimes drinks cola.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think kids are more likely to be made unhealthy by food guilt and shame and pressure and criticism than by Cheetos or chips. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Maybe those unschoolers are onto something, after all.&quot;","postDate":"1272617152","msgId":53639,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc4MzEzLjI1NTU4LnFtQHdlYjg2MjAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJCNUY2MUY5LTA4QUItNDRDRS1BMTdELTlCMzE3NjAwMjMxMEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEJDNUQxM0NELTZBRTgtNDlBOC1CQ0JFLUQ5NzNDNjFFRTUyOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDI1MjcyMC42Mjg2NS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDcubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPiA8QkI1RjYxRjktMDhBQi00NENFLUExN0QtOUIzMTc2MDAyMzEwQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53624,"nextInTopic":53643,"prevInTime":53638,"nextInTime":53640,"topicId":53622,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Simon and Linnaea like cheetos, and we have to get them imported.

Fortunately we&#39;ve met a woman whose husband is in the USAF and she can get us cheetos from the base. But I bet they trade a good orange for cheetos every time. Oranges are hard though. When they are good, man, yumm, but if they aren&#39;t ripe enough or if they are too insipid tasting, well, they need punch and flavour and goodness. Cheetos are the same pretty much every time. Although the curly ones that look like pigs&#39; tails they aren&#39;t so flavourful, they&#39;re just novel. They wouldn&#39;t trade picking strawberries and eating them for cheetos, they wouldn&#39;t trade David&#39;s risotto for cheetos. But this woman would, right? So clearly her junk food versus good food outlook has worked a treat. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night at dance class one of the musicians brought little baklavas in. And one of the dancers talked about how she has an unhealthy obsession with sweet things. Linnaea and I had just been talking about loving food in the car on the way to class. She was talking about how much she enjoys eating good food. David had bought a couple of cheap chickens from the grocery store to cook up for the cats and the dog and Linnaea had tried some of the meat and said it was flavourless. We get free range chickens from the butcher normally. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what got her thinking about food and enjoying food. Both she and Simon are doing their own food explorations and discoveries and have their own relationships with what they eat. I got little mini chocolate covered doughnuts yesterday and Simon grabbed them and ran for the computer with them when we got home. With both David and I sneaking quite a few and Linnaea a few less the tub of 30 little doughnuts still has<br/>\n 9 in it, but of the 18 bagels I made 2 days ago, there are 2 left. No unhealthy obsession, just a healthy joy in the taste and the pleasure and the energy given.<br/>\n<br/>\nFood is such a wonderful aspect of life. Sharing it, creating it, growing it, killing it, buying it, exploring it, just this huge wonderful experience. Labelling it as something fearful and worthy of huge rules and barriers and boundaries just screws it all up. Why would anyone want to torture themselves over something so fantastic as a honey and nut and filo pastry morsel? Or a cheeto?<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:Sandra@...\">Sandra@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 30 April, 2010 1:53:09<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Maybe those unschoolers are onto something, after all.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-***And even if they are, well, any<br/>\nkid worth his salt will figure out how to trade the orange for the<br/>\nCheetos in a heartbeat.&quot;***-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat gets me about this is that she&#39;s basically saying any child who  <br/>\ndid NOT want Cheetohs would be... what, a wimp?
