I won&#39;t post it here, but here is the link to my blogpost.  The top portion is what I sent to my friend, with the lovely post Claire wrote yesterday about finding calm (Claire, you said just what I wanted to so much better than I could, and shared at the perfect time!).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is dealing with criticism or resistance, or trying to find their way through letting go of expectations, you may find something useful in the post...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://memismommy.blogspot.com/2009/09/comment-on-another-moms-blogpost.html\">http://memismommy.blogspot.com/2009/09/comment-on-another-moms-blogpost.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d be interested in any swirls of thought that might arise....<br/>\n<br/>\nShan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":47656,"nextTopicId":47587}}
