The biggest single factor for healthy<br/>\nteeth is hereditary. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there&#39;s been talk for over ten years now, following a study in Toronto, I <br/>\nthink, that it&#39;s a disease, bacterial, passed on from mother to child when <br/>\nthe children are very young.  So if a mother has had lots of cavities they <br/>\nprobably have that bacterial infection, and so they should not share food <br/>\nwith kids.  But mothers DO share food with kids, and kiss them, and breathe <br/>\nin their faces.  And so you get genetics AND contagion.<br/>\n<br/>\nA family of my acquaintance has never even bought toothbrushes for their kids <br/>\nbecause the parents didn&#39;t have cavities (the mom didn&#39;t anyway) and the kids <br/>\ndon&#39;t either.  They don&#39;t have bad breath, their teeth are like perfect, and <br/>\nthey don&#39;t brush.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for sugar and tooth decay, if you have that condition, Jolly Ranchers <br/>\ndon&#39;t help a bit.  But there&#39;s sugar in all carbohydrates and so avoidance of <br/>\ncandy is another parental fib.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was little I was told these &quot;truths&quot; which I would probably have been <br/>\nsmacked for questioning aloud:<br/>\n<br/>\nfrench fries cause pimples<br/>\ndon&#39;t take a bath when you&#39;re on your period (and DO NOT swim)<br/>\ncoffee will stunt your growth<br/>\nchocolate is bad for kids--limit it  (it&#39;s not bad for adults, they can have <br/>\nall they want)<br/>\nif you brush your teeth you won&#39;t have cavities (therefor if you get a cavity <br/>\nit is plainly and simply because you didn&#39;t brush your teeth enough)<br/>\nif you stick your tongue out your face might stick like that<br/>\nif you cross your eyes they might stick like that<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s probably more that I&#39;ve gladly blocked out.<br/>\n<br/>\nOH!  My mom never served milk and fish at the same time because she said some <br/>\npeople are allergic to the combination and it would kill them and she wasn&#39;t <br/>\ngoing to risk it. <br/>\n<br/>\nA year after having my favorite Tastee Freez meal at least weekly I realized <br/>\nit was a milk shake and a fish sandwich, and realized I was not personally <br/>\nmyself going to die from fish and milk together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2922,"nextTopicId":3193}}
