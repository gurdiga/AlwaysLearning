Slight possibility... are you discussing these things with him in terms of what he&#39;s doing to YOUR (singular) children rather than &quot;our&quot; children?   If the situation is antagonistic between you and your husband, then one of you will lose.  If you say &quot;Do NOT pull their ears, because I said so,&quot; then he either does what you say (and loses) or he pulls their ears (and he wins, you lose).   Find a way to be partners as he (perhaps gradually) moves toward where you want him to be.

I asked her what they used to do together that was enjoyable. She reached for the memories, and with some effort described going out for spontaneous lunches, walks on the beach and making music together. She sounded as if those memories were pretty dusty. <br/>\n<br/>\nI invited her to try those things anew. She was reticent, reminding me that there were pressing issues that needed attention. I assured her that there was time for them too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a surprisingly short time, she called me and said that things were already shifting. It was much easier to feel good about being with her husband when they were talking about pleasant things, rather than always making a beeline for problems.

You might say something playful, like, <br/>\n&quot;If he pulled your ears as often as he says he will your ears would be so long they would drag on the floor!&quot;   Or whatever might be more suited to the moment and your family humor.

Or they might inherit another set if, while you&#39;re working to meet your emotional needs, you neglect theirs.   Be careful.   You have a small window of time with your children.

And in many cases it seems to be a validation of plain old narcissism.   If you&#39;re finding it helpful then that&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m cautioning against living so much in your own head, devoted to your own desires and problems, that you fail to see what your children really need.    <br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has issues.  Everyone.   You&#39;re not special because you had childhood hurts.  I don&#39;t mean to be harsh, just to help you get out of your head for a little while and think about what is going on in your life, today.   You are the mother of children.  You are not a child.   You&#39;re not weak and helpless and at the mercy of grown ups.  You are the grown up. <br/>\n<br/>\n***That sounds like &quot;shut up and be gratefull for what you have&quot;. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nNo.  I didn&#39;t write, &quot;shut up.&quot;   What could you do today to make life more fun or more interesting or more comfortable?    What could you do to help your family feel a little happier?    Do that.   Do that every day.  Don&#39;t start your day by thinking that you don&#39;t have enough of something... energy, money, time,  whatever.   Start by thinking that you have exactly enough to have a good day today.  Positive changes in your words, thinking and actions will make positive changes in your life. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing grateful for what you have is not a bad idea.   Maybe it was used to guilt you into certain kinds of behavior when you were a child so you&#39;re uncomfortable about it. You don&#39;t have to always consider it a tool for manipulation.  It can be a way to gain perspective when you seem to be stuck.          <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wrote, &quot;start looking at what you have instead of what you don&#39;t have.&quot;  <br/>\nEnjoy what you have.  Don&#39;t compare it with the glorious things you think others have.   Don&#39;t compare it to some perfect ideal in your head.  Make choices that make each day a good day for your family.  Maintain a realistic perspective.   That can help you feel better right now, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb Lewis<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Newbie questions","postDate":"1301321371","msgId":60442,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDlGNEMyNUZDLTgwQTctNDk2Ri1CQ0Q2LTA0NjNBODYzQzEwREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEJBTkxrVGk9dFFmMTJ1UUpXRDgtK3pMaUtvS0tqMmlibkRnQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUVNWak1NcUx6QmpWUU1MTHkxSEF1cDg3MTc5ZVRkbW5qZnE0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDk2NTc4MTZDNzUyMDQxQkRBOTY0RjhFNTQ3NzYzRTkxQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPiA8QkFOTGtUaT10UWYxMnVRSldEOC0rekxpS29LS2oyaWJuRGdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":60441,"nextInTopic":60443,"prevInTime":60441,"nextInTime":60443,"topicId":60346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=Well, I always wonder about that.

Because if the wife is trying to learn and model being a partner to each person in the family, she can&#39;t leave her husband until last, or she risks not having a husband at all, and in the case of divorce, unschooling is often the first thing to go.  And sometimes there come to be a stepmother, and a stepfather, in addition to school<br/>\n<br/>\nFrance is not &quot;unschooling friendly.&quot;  That will make it even worse if one parent tries to force the other parent&#39;s hand, and will make it more difficult to &quot;prove&quot; unschooling can work, if there are visits from the government and tests in their immediate future.  Unschooling needs a rich, supportive family life as a work base,  not strife and sorrow and fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the purpose of this list is not to solve individual people&#39;s problems, but it &quot;will focus on how people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or jurisdiction.&quot;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSo even the discussion of how to persuade a husband can be (or become, if it&#39;s stretched) off topic.

My husband/kids&#39; dad has been encountering <br/>\nsome serious fears of not being &quot;up to the task&quot; (his words) of <br/>\npeacefully/mindfully parenting 3 children (4.75yo and twin 16mos). The more he <br/>\ndoubts himself, the less patient he becomes and the more passive aggressive (how <br/>\nhe was parented by his dad) he becomes.  He is a naturally highly sensitive <br/>\nperson with a major desire to please others, so I could see how my recognition <br/>\nof his moments of sweetness, patience, kindness, and helpfulness would get him <br/>\nto where he&#39;d like to be as a father (more patient and kind) much faster and <br/>\nwith more good feelings for him (and in turn for the kids and me) than the times <br/>\nwhen I point out what he&#39;s not doing patiently and kindly, which usually results <br/>\nin him feeling badly about himself, less able to be patient and kind towards the <br/>\nkids, and reinforces parenting behaviors/styles similar to his parents. Now that <br/>\nI think about it, when I calmly discuss with him the areas that are and aren&#39;t <br/>\nworking for the kids, me, or him, I think he may feel like I am pointing out the <br/>\nnegatives more often than the positives, and this is why he often  feels <br/>\ndefeated (the last thing I want him to feel) coming away from those <br/>\nconversations. I feel like this is such a given; I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t see <br/>\nthis before. I will work on recognizing (in a more casual manner as opposed to <br/>\nthe &quot;let&#39;s sit down and have a discussion&quot; way that we usually do) when he is <br/>\nsweet, patient, helpful, etc rather than addressing when he is not.

It isn&#39;t even so much that he came to really believe in unschooling but that he came to not be afraid of how we were living and learning.    Even if your partner never becomes the poster parent for unschooling advocacy you can still have a comfortable and peaceful unschooling life. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you talk about unschooling, listen to your partner&#39;s concerns.  Don&#39;t dismiss them.  Answer them in reasonable and reassuring ways as much as possible.   Don&#39;t expect him to agree with your general feelings that things will somehow be ok.   Give him something real.

Share them with your husband.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, when David had worries I couldn&#39;t seem to calm, I would remind him that he trusted me.   That&#39;s not an ideal strategy but if you don&#39;t use it too often it can help.   I reminded him that he had trusted me with his tiny, helpless baby while he was away long hours at work and that he had this pile of evidence in his head that said I would not do anything to hurt Dylan.  <br/>\n<br/>\n***Yet I do feel he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrealise the kids are really scared of him...

My mom&#39;s perception of my dad influenced how we saw him when we were little.  Instead of letting us have our own relationship with him, she molded it.  *She* was intimidated by him and so was sure we ought to be.   My mother had very little humor and my dad had a biting sarcastic wit.  It scared  and hurt my mom and she seemed to not consider that her children shared some genes with their father.   Your children don&#39;t necessarily feel what you feel. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was your husband&#39;s relationship with his father?   He is probably parenting much like his father did.

Go for a walk or run at night when your husband is home with the kids or in the morning before he leaves.  Get to a yoga class or a gym.  Jump rope.  Do something physical every day.

My time with my children is a gift I give myself because it is only this little slice of time in my life that I will have this opportunity. Children grow up fast and I want to be able to enjoy being a mother of young children. I avoid stressors as much as possible because it impedes on my ability to parent well. This includes the mainstream philosophy of regularly scheduled &#39;me-time&#39; for the mom. I have little snippets of time here and there, when it does not inconvenience the children. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband sees his time with the children as a gift to himself for similar reasons. He made the decision to work 4 days a week and gave up promotions that would have meant more travel and stress during their childhood. His parents were constantly busy, stressed and quarreling. Although they worked from home, he often felt lonely and neglected while growing up. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur gift to the children is that they have parents who are mindful, engaging, and constantly working to improve on their craft of being good parents. <br/>\n<br/>\nRippy<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/59696\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/59696</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat whole topic might be of interest. <br/>\ntoo boring to unschool?<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/59648\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/59648</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":430148316,"authorName":"Joy","from":"Joy &lt;whatismyusername@...&gt;","profile":"whatismyusername@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Newbie questions","postDate":"1300787681","msgId":60363,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZBRkUwMDlBLTAxOUEtNDM4OS05NzZFLTk3RkFEOTk5NzkwMUB5bWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUVNWak1NcUx6QmpWUU1MTHkxSEF1cDg3MTc5ZVRkbW5qZnE0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUVNWak1NcUx6QmpWUU1MTHkxSEF1cDg3MTc5ZVRkbW5qZnE0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60360,"nextInTopic":60366,"prevInTime":60362,"nextInTime":60364,"topicId":60346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Too good to be true<br/>\nI thought it must be some traps waiting for me otherwise I couldn&#39;t understand why anyone would choose the conventional way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my personal experience, yes, it is true. Following unschooling principles helps us to create joyful living, like holiday everyday...of course we had challenging moments and issues too. But overall, both kids and adults are much happier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they are learning A LOT! It just doesn&#39;t follow school schedule. My ds5 is learning something that may be taught at fifth grade but maybe he hasn&#39;t touched upon some subjects that is supposed to be learned by 5-year-old (not many I can think of)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I see myself contribute to the economy a lot<br/>\nBy not taking on a job that may be needed by other people (lol). And raising children is a very important job<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t feel guilty any more. Instead, I feel very confident with my choice. And if I ever go back to work force, I will be much better worker or leader from the parenting training I received.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I was like you reading a lot but not spending time with my children. One reason was I didn&#39;t know how to play. Now I learned to be playful and continue to progress. The second reason, I learned to slow down to smell the rose and slow down to my children&#39;s universe of time and pace. It feels very good! The third reason, I &quot;allow&quot; myself to be &quot;non-productive&quot;, I allow myself to enjoy &quot;silly things&quot; like coloring a page myself, I allow myself to play like a 2-yo or 5-yo...I allow myself many things I was not allowed when I grew up. Unschooling is also a healing process for myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I listened to Sandra, read a little......I kind of stopped reading...just spend time with my children and learn to enjoy the time (not just doing my duty). When I encounter issues or doubts, I came back to read a little...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat helps me a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; And then there is the anxiety I tend to feel when I am around my kid, tring<br/>\n&gt; to give them my full attention.

Physically I am<br/>\n&gt; here allright (I&#39;ve been a stay at home mum since I got pregnant with dd),<br/>\n&gt; but most of the time I am just &quot;fleeing&quot; from them.

And yet, the time I spend online or reading books or<br/>\n&gt; desperately seeking adult company feels like trying to escape. When I try to<br/>\n&gt; fight the anxiety It builds up. I feel bored to death, I get grumpy and it<br/>\n&gt; escalates... untill I can escape and let some steam out. I don&#39;t know what<br/>\n&gt; it is.

An unhappy husband and a wife who feels guilt for not <br/>\nearning an income can both be easily resolved by the stay at home wife working <br/>\nvery hard to make the home life comfortable.  By staying home you may not be <br/>\nmaking money, but you can be saving money.  You can make meals instead of eating <br/>\nout, you have the luxury of time.  Time has value, so do valuable things with <br/>\nyour time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time and effort to create a peaceful home environment.  If your husband <br/>\nis willing and able to earn an income, then support him in that.  Do those nice <br/>\nthings for him, step it up a bit.  Tidy up the house before he gets home, make <br/>\nfood he enjoys, create an atmosphere in which he can easily be with the kids in <br/>\na non stressful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile you are home with the kids, engage them in interesting things, so much so, <br/>\nthat they are full and happy and pleasant to be around, as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWasted food is wasted food.  That is a hard issue for a lot of people, <br/>\nespecially if the person has ever been poor or experienced lack of food.  My <br/>\nfather grew up in poverty and that is one issue that he still struggles with, <br/>\nmostly internally, but sometimes he does verbalize it.  When we visit my parents <br/>\nhome, I dish out all food servings to my kids.  I give them tiny portions, <br/>\nalmost ridiculously small portions, and then they can finish everything on their <br/>\nplates and get seconds if they want to.  It&#39;s not ideal, but it&#39;s so much better <br/>\nthan feeling badly for wasting food.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up with that.  I was able to get over it by visualizing that my child had <br/>\nfinished it rather than the garbage eating it.  It helped me to think in terms <br/>\nof pretending that my child had finished it all.  The food was gone, either way. <br/>\n Some kids eat enormous amounts of food.  I knew a 4 yr old that ate over twice <br/>\nthe amount of food that I did.  Knowing that helped too.  The amount a person <br/>\neats is so relative.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could help your husband see how lucky he is that his children don&#39;t eat so <br/>\nmuch, that there is milk left to be wasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout drinking cola... why is it just cola?  There are so many soft drinks on <br/>\nthe market, experiment and enjoy.  My family really likes ginger ale.  I love <br/>\ngrapefruit soda.  You could make Italian sodas with bubbly water and flavors and <br/>\nwhipped cream.  Some kids really like soda.  With free access to soda, I have <br/>\none kid who still prefers water to most anything else and one who would choose <br/>\nsoda over almost anything, although sometimes she chooses milk or juice or <br/>\nwater.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Newbie questions","postDate":"1300752765","msgId":60357,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGltOHBodCs3NGptQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUVNWak1NcUx6QmpWUU1MTHkxSEF1cDg3MTc5ZVRkbW5qZnE0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60354,"nextInTopic":60360,"prevInTime":60356,"nextInTime":60358,"topicId":60346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Dad is worried about wasting milk. Your son wants his cereal nice and moist. Can you get some differently shaped bowls that let the milk rise up over the cereal better? Alternately, can you use that milk for something else - baking, perhaps?

It helps to let your husband know that he is appreciated in as many ways as you can - as a provider, as a person who cares about his children, a friend and a lover. Extend to him the same principles of kindness and thoughtfulness you would like for you kids. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake home a place he wants to be - his soft place to fall, the place where he&#39;s loved and respected. If he can feel that at home, it&#39;s much easier to go to work, knowing he&#39;s helping to create that warm, soft place. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Newbie questions","postDate":"1300752506","msgId":60354,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDNkUxNDFBLUNENzQtNDIxQi1BRUFDLTZBOUYyQjYyMDBBOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUVNWak1NcUx6QmpWUU1MTHkxSEF1cDg3MTc5ZVRkbW5qZnE0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluUVNWak1NcUx6QmpWUU1MTHkxSEF1cDg3MTc5ZVRkbW5qZnE0UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":60346,"nextInTopic":60357,"prevInTime":60353,"nextInTime":60355,"topicId":60346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-When I read you it almost feels like unschooling can only work for selfless saints like you guys.

It&#39;s such an amazing source of<br/>\ninspiration. I&#39;ve been reading and reading and reading and it feels like<br/>\nthings are profoundly changing in the way I see life. It almost feels like<br/>\nmy brain is being re-wired, which is a little painfull and a little scary.<br/>\nBut it feels soooo right!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am Claire, in France, I live near Geneva with my husband and our 2<br/>\nchildren, ds is 7 and dd is 5. We started homeschooling a couple of months<br/>\nago and it is dawning on me that using a curriculum will just not work in<br/>\nour house. I totally, absolutely hate to be the person who is boring my kids<br/>\nwith trying to force-teach them anything... So we&#39;re moving into<br/>\nunschooling. I&#39;m reading a lot, experimenting a bit, sleeping on it...<br/>\n(repeat). I have dropped the curriculum and we&#39;re mostly just enjoying the<br/>\n&quot;vacation&quot;. I have started to say yes more... yes you can watch another<br/>\nmovie, yes you can have only breakfast cereals for dinner, yes you can eat<br/>\ncandy just before dinner, yes you can skip dinner altogether, yes you can<br/>\nplay some more video games... Go ahead darling, with a smile :-) It feels<br/>\ngood to do so and the kids are loving it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have some questions though, it feels like 3 or 4 sort of separate<br/>\nquestions. I wonder if I should make a separate post with each questions...<br/>\nexcuse my inexperience with posting to this list (and feel free to slice my<br/>\npost into several if that&#39;s better)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest one is... I find it hard to create a nice working, respectful<br/>\npartnering relationship with my husband. He sort of agreed to let me<br/>\nhomeschool the kids, It was not his first choice. Dropping the curriculum is<br/>\nnot what we had kind of agreed on. I really need to talk about it with him,<br/>\nbut I so don&#39;t know where to start... he mostly speaks french and malagasy<br/>\nand there is very little material available... Moreover, I seem to<br/>\nconstantly find myself in a power struggle. The &quot;standard&quot; scenario is<br/>\nsomething like what happened last night: ds wants more milk in his cereal.<br/>\nDh says that he is concerned ds will spoil the extra milk because there is<br/>\nalready a lot, ds looks at me... I tell him something like &quot;daddy would like<br/>\nyou to take small chunks of milk and he&#39;s happy to give you more if you want<br/>\nmore, He&#39;s worried if you take more then you can drink it will be<br/>\nspoiled&quot;. Dh gives ds the milk along with menaces like &quot;if you don&#39;t drink<br/>\nit all I&#39;ll pull your ears&quot;, I try not to say anything, my son is watching<br/>\nme with &quot;please mom, rescue me&quot; look. I feel nervous and don&#39;t know what to<br/>\ndo. Ds eats most of his cereals and then starts to fidget on his chair. He<br/>\nlooks worried, maybe scared. He&#39;s looking at me for help. My anxiety level<br/>\nrises (not to mention ds is recovering from meazles and he&#39;s been throwing<br/>\nup a lot lately, I really feel concerned his stomac won&#39;t take the extra<br/>\nmilk if he forces it in because he&#39;s scared of dad). In a little voice, ds<br/>\nsays &quot;my tummy aches&quot;, I can&#39;t help but tell him &quot;don&#39;t make yourself sick<br/>\nwith drinking the milk if you&#39;re full&quot;. Ds leaves the milk, gets up and<br/>\naround the table and comes to me with bowed head, asking for a hug. I give<br/>\nhim one. Dh gives me a dark look... I can tell he feels I&#39;ve sided with my<br/>\nson against him. AGAIN. That&#39;s so not what I wanted, I so don&#39;t know how to<br/>\nhandle situations like this. Yet it happens rather often. My husband is a<br/>\nlittle rough with the kids, they rush to me asking for help, I feel helpless<br/>\nand frustrated, stuck between a rock and a hard place. I tried &quot;siding&quot; with<br/>\nmy husband a few times, but it feels so totally not me inside, I think the<br/>\nkids can tell I don&#39;t mean it... Dh says he has no problem with the kids<br/>\nwhen I am not around. I totally believe him... Yet I do feel he doesn&#39;t<br/>\nrealise the kids are really scared of him... They tell me they are, and I<br/>\ntry to tell him as gently as I can, but he says I am making it up, and it&#39;s<br/>\nall my fault because I always say yes to everything... I feel confused...<br/>\nAny hints? Experiences? Books?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat brings me to... guilt. Something in me feels this way of life is just<br/>\nway to good to be true.... and must be at somebody&#39;s expense. Namely my<br/>\nhusband. Intellectually I totally believe that guiding children though their<br/>\nchildhood is the most important job there is (or do I?). Yet I can&#39;t help<br/>\nbut feel like I am not contributing to the economy (but is that a bad<br/>\nthing?) and that somebody has to pay for my fun life... It almost feels<br/>\nartificial. Life as a lifelong holiday. And yet, could it be the rest of the<br/>\nworld, the &quot;schoolers&quot; who have it upside down? But then our lifestyle has a<br/>\ncost and someone has to pick up the bills... I feel very<br/>\npuzzled/confused/lost around that one. Have some of you been there? Is it<br/>\npart of the regular deschooling brain rewiring? Dos the guilt go eventually?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there is the anxiety I tend to feel when I am around my kid, tring<br/>\nto give them my full attention. As much as I hate to admit it, I must say I<br/>\nhave not spent much time with my kids since they were born. Physically I am<br/>\nhere allright (I&#39;ve been a stay at home mum since I got pregnant with dd),<br/>\nbut most of the time I am just &quot;fleeing&quot; from them. Mostly reading books or<br/>\nsurfing the internet or seeking for adult company anywhere I can find it.<br/>\nPart of it has been amazing, transformative and all. If not for books and<br/>\nthe internet, I wouldn&#39;t have found out about attachement parenting,<br/>\nunschooling and tons of other amazingly good stuff that has transformed our<br/>\nlife for the better. And yet, the time I spend online or reading books or<br/>\ndesperately seeking adult company feels like trying to escape. When I try to<br/>\nfight the anxiety It builds up. I feel bored to death, I get grumpy and it<br/>\nescalates... untill I can escape and let some steam out. I don&#39;t know what<br/>\nit is. I suspect part of it has to do with the previous 2 questions.... Part<br/>\nof it probably has to do with how I was raised. I know there is something<br/>\nelse there. I tried focusing on that (as in &quot;inner relationship focusing&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.focusingresources.com/)\">http://www.focusingresources.com/)</a> but with little success to this day. Any<br/>\nidea? I read all your posts and feel like I am such a selfish mum... When I<br/>\nread you it almost feels like unschooling can only work for selfless saints<br/>\nlike you guys. And yet you don&#39;t really sound like selfless saint either...<br/>\nWhat am I missing?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finaly the easy one: cola. I&#39;ve stopped limiting how much cola ds<br/>\ndrinks. He had 3 litres in 2 days. That feels like a LOT. My niece (who is<br/>\nnow 25) is a total coca cola addict. She will not go anywhere without a 1.5<br/>\nliter coca cola bottle, or at the very least a couple of cans in her<br/>\nhandbag. I can&#39;t help but feel it&#39;s not good for her health and feel<br/>\nconcerned. My sister restricted how much cola she could have when she was a<br/>\nchild by hardly buying any. I did that too until last week. I hardly bought<br/>\nany, but when there was coke around, I would let him drink some. Most of my<br/>\nfriends believe coca cola is addictive like a drug. If they&#39;re right,<br/>\nletting my son drink as much as he wants will not help... How long should I<br/>\nexpect the coke frenzy to last (I appreciate 2 days is not enough for him to<br/>\nfeel relax that he can have some whenever he wants)? How do your kids handle<br/>\nsoda in general and coke in particular?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis post is getting way too long, sorry...<br/>\n<br/>\nWarmly<br/>\nClaire<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60574,"nextTopicId":60563}}
