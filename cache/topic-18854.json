I was still anxious but, I decided it was <br/>\nmy problem.  I stopped discussing what we were doing with all nay <br/>\nsayers and I stood in the gap for my son so he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nquestioned or pressured by them either. <br/>\n<br/>\nI made a list of local activities and sat it on his desk.  Kameron <br/>\ncame to me and asked about the ones that he was interested in.  When <br/>\nwe did the first few we had a great time.  At least I was feeling <br/>\nlike we were doing something.  Then he just started talking about <br/>\nthings related to what we saw.  He was independantly reading about <br/>\nthem, watching shows and choosing books to learn more on those and <br/>\nrelated topics.  I would be willing to bet he&#39;s read more, with more <br/>\ncomprehension in the last month than he has in the last year! And <br/>\nhe&#39;s reading for longer periods of time and having fun to boot!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI started believing that everything really is learning.  This moring <br/>\nover breakfast he turned to me and said, &quot;I&#39;m accomplishing my <br/>\ndreams, I feel like my life is going to be like I always dreamed.&quot; <br/>\nHe explained about how he&#39;s learning so much about what he wants to <br/>\nbe when he grows up and how he was going to do it.  At first it was <br/>\njust the joy of knowing my child was happy and so positive. (He had <br/>\nvery negative feelings about himself and learning before.) Then the <br/>\nreality and depth of what he said hit me.
