I would like to reply to a couple of issues that have been discussed recently.  In regards to &quot;swinging to the opposite extreme,&quot;  I discovered some time ago that this has happened to me.  Because I was brought up under excessive control and was subjected to humiliating beatings and punishments (for example, when I began menstruating I put soiled underwear to soak in the sink in my own personal bathroom and my dad held my head and rubbed my face in them), I was determined that I would raise my children differently.  I thought I was using &quot;positive parenting,&quot; but actually I was being permissive.  This is a struggle for me, but I am trying to learn firmness.<br/>\n <br/>\nAnd the other thing is this issue w allowing children time w grandparents who were questionable in their parenting.  We are very isolated, and there are few people in our lives who love my son.  I have struggled since my son&#39;s birth on allowing him much time w my parents.  Will&#39;s other grandma recently died and I just cannot bear to totally deprive him of grandparents.  However, he will not be left w them...I tried it once; told them I would return in under two hours and they were gone when I returned.  Neither my mom or dad would answer their cell phones.  For four hours I could not get in touch w them.  My son was exclusively breastfed at the time and they did not have any of my milk.  I was a mess and when they brought him back to me they acted like I was totally irrational and ridiculous to be so upset.  It took me a long time to get over this, and like I say, I will NEVER leave him w them again...but I do bring him by to visit.  However, last week at lunch w my mom she made a<br/>\n statement in front of my son which I just cannot get over.  She has a huge problem w the fact that my 2 year old still nurses.  And she is entitled to her opinion and I will debate w her privately.  But in front of Will she stated to me &quot;You know they will take him away from you for that.&quot;  I think that this is unacceptable...I imagine that statement would be terribly frightening to him (he showed no reaction) and I am seriously considering cutting relations w my mom over this.  I don&#39;t want to be petty or ridiculous and am trying to be forgiving but it really pissed me off and I have not gotten over it yet!  But anyway, I was trying to say that I can certainly understand someone having trouble in denying their children access to their grandparents, even when these same grandparents have made (highly) questionable decisions in the past.     <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, thanks Tuck, for the excellent suggestion regarding teaching time.  I did just what you suggested and Will is so grateful to now be able to read the clocks.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m really enjoying this list.  Thanks!<br/>\nMillie<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nFriends.  Fun. Try the all-new Yahoo!
