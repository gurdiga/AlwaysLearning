(There are also <br/>\n&quot;middens&quot; so archeologists can figure out what people ate, and there are graves <br/>\nand bones and sometimes evidence of dwellings.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout myths or religous clues, and without linguistic evidence, I think it <br/>\nmust be impossible to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Pedophilia&quot; is a greek word, and they&#39;re famous/infamous/stereotyped as <br/>\nbeing (or having once been) a society in which men had sex with boys and sheep.  <br/>\n(Scotland gets that later accusation/jab too.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn British English they have the term &quot;buggery&quot; for butt-fucking.  American <br/>\nEnglish has no such term (just the mondo-gross term I used just before this).  <br/>\n[A young American friend who attended English schools for a few years got in <br/>\ntrouble for telling a boy who was picking on her to &quot;bug off.&quot;  What was a <br/>\nbenign American-English term was a nasty Brit phrase.]<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sodomy&quot; is a non-Greek legal term, but there&#39;s no real evidence that Sodom <br/>\n(the Biblical city from which that term comes) was guilty of that particular <br/>\nsin.
