His book is about the differences in <br/>\neducation opportunities between rich suburbs (where mostly white people live) <br/>\nand innercity (where mostly brow people live) schools. He described being at a <br/>\nparty in a rich suburb and having conversations with wealthy people who either <br/>\nsend their children to expensive private schools or ensure that they live in <br/>\nsuburbs that offer their children excellent opportunities with plenty of <br/>\nlearning materials, well-paid teachers, etc. And heard them ask, over and over, &quot;Do <br/>\nyou really think more money would make a difference?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHis response: &quot;You certainly seem to think so.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would happen if the best, proven, and best paid teachers in a given <br/>\nstate were sent, along with other funding and materials, to the poorest districts <br/>\nwith the children who had the least home support? Of course it&#39;s not a <br/>\nshoe-in...but it couldn&#39;t hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16852,"nextTopicId":16817}}
