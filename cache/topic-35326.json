I have learned a lot so far and look forward<br/>\nto learning even more.  I have not called it babysitting except for in my<br/>\ninitial email and I wouldn&#39;t call it that when describing it to Seth (he<br/>\nwould make that determination on his own).  I have also heard many stories<br/>\nof people saying the kid(s) are 15 and either getting away with it OR the<br/>\nmost extreme was that the child was connecting flights and they asked for<br/>\nher ID, when she couldn&#39;t produce proof of being 15 they held her at the<br/>\nairport until her father flew to get her and escort her to her final<br/>\ndestination.  It ended up costing the family much more than the fee they<br/>\nwere trying to avoid.  <br/>\nMy biggest beef with the escort is the cost.  I understand the protection<br/>\nand peace of mind it might provide and that it is kind of a CYA thing for<br/>\nthe airlines but Seth is fully capable of flying alone and overcoming any<br/>\nhiccups that might happen along the way.  Since I know he will do just fine<br/>\non his own, I find it irritating that we would have to pay a fee just<br/>\nbecause they think we need it - let us make that determination.

There has been mention of a<br/>\npossible waiver and I will look into that as well.  <br/>\nI have looked online at several of the airlines and there are at least 3<br/>\nthat do require the &#39;escort&#39; and the fees have been the same ($100 each<br/>\nway).

(xposted)<br/>\n <br/>\nSeth is going to NBTSC this year (in Oregon) and we are discovering that for<br/>\na minor under 15 to travel alone (unaccompanied minor) the airlines require<br/>\nan additional fee of $100 both ways and will escort the kids from gate to<br/>\ngate and basically babysit them.  All that would be great if Seth weren&#39;t a<br/>\npretty independent and competent kid who will be 14 at the time of travel<br/>\nand would find having a babysitter appalling.  My first inclination is to<br/>\njust say he is 15 and hope for the best but I worry that they will ask for<br/>\nbirth certificate for proof.
