(I&#39;m still working on it.)  It <br/>\n*is* important to move, but it&#39;s also important to listen to your <br/>\nbody.  For your daughter, it might start out as simple exercises done in <br/>\nbed, *very* gently and gradually.  It might start, as I think you said, <br/>\nwith just getting out of bed and spending some time in the family room each <br/>\nday.  It might mean walking up and down the hall once before settling on <br/>\nthe couch.  Then after a week or so, it might mean twice up and down the <br/>\nhall.<br/>\nWhen I was first diagnosed, I started using the rebounder.  I didn&#39;t <br/>\nactually jump.  I still don&#39;t.  I just genly bounced on it for several <br/>\nminutes.  I gradually increased the time until I could do 15 or 20 <br/>\nminutes.  Then I hit the wall.  That&#39;s all I can do.  The distance I can <br/>\nwalk doesn&#39;t change either, even when I walk every day.  She&#39;ll have to <br/>\nfind her personal wall.<br/>\nI&#39;ve found for myself that I can accomplish quite a bit if I vary my <br/>\nactivities and space the physical work throughout the day.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>\nget a feel for that at first.  This spring I was trying to beat the weeds <br/>\nto the strawberries.  (Actually I was trying to find them among the weeds <br/>\nbefore they finished blooming.)  I would work till I was tired and then <br/>\npush it a little longer.  Then I was completely wiped and in pain for the <br/>\nday.  That would take maybe 30 minutes.  Lately I&#39;ve been quitting <br/>\ngardening or housework sooner, at the first sign of tiredness.  I&#39;m finding <br/>\nthat doing it that way lets me put in 3 or 4 sessions in a day.  I also am <br/>\nunable to think clearly for more than a couple of hours at a time.  So I <br/>\nalternate short (15-20 minutes) of activity with an hour or two at the <br/>\ncomputer and/or practising my instruments.  It seems to be working, and I&#39;m <br/>\ngetting more accomplished than I have in years.<br/>\nYou have to be especially careful of exercise if the diagnosis is or could <br/>\nbe chronic fatigue syndrome as well as fibro.  Many people with CFS are <br/>\nexercise-intolerant, and even a little too much can send them into a major <br/>\nflare.  Your daughter really needs to learn how to listen to her own <br/>\nbody.  You can help by gently nudging her to try the gentlest forms of <br/>\nexercise and find her own limits, then keep gently pushing them.<br/>\nTia, who also feels like a truck ran over her in the morning, and when she <br/>\ngets up out of a chair<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make you feel inferior without your consent.<br/>\nEleanor Roosevelt<br/>\n*********************************************<br/>\nTia Leschke<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:leschke@...\">leschke@...</a><br/>\nOn Vancouver Island</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":69247285,"authorName":"Sharon Rudd","from":"Sharon Rudd &lt;bearspawprint@...&gt;","profile":"bearspawprint","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Living with Fibromyalgia","postDate":"1023609507","msgId":7520,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDIwNjA5MDc1ODI3LjgzOTMucW1haWxAd2ViMTQzMDUubWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGFkc2s0OSt1ZDF0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":7518,"nextInTopic":7521,"prevInTime":7519,"nextInTime":7521,"topicId":7483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

My son was eight and I also<br/>\nhad my three nieces here, nine, ten and thirteen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was rarely time, money or chance to go anywhere, but when we got an<br/>\nhour, go we did.  Walking, bike riding,  just out for a soda.  The oldest<br/>\ngirl didn&#39;t mind looking out for the younger kids, for short periods, and<br/>\nwould take them swimming, or over to the creek.  We found a trampoline at<br/>\na garage sale and what a wonderful diversion that turned out to be.  We<br/>\nset up the tent in the back yard so anyone who couldn&#39;t stand to listen<br/>\nto a sick person anymore could escape.  <br/>\nWe took the small TV / VCR out there and a portable stereo.   The kids<br/>\noften ate their dinner out there.  The girls are my husbands sister&#39;s<br/>\nchildren, so they were not comfortable around my father.  But Dylan would<br/>\nread to him, tell stories, draw new pictures for him every few days.  He<br/>\npainted a garden on an old bed sheet and hung it on the wall, since my<br/>\ndad couldn&#39;t get outside.   My father was a gardener and Dylan would tell<br/>\nhim what was growing, which bugs were out, what was blooming.   <br/>\nWe really tried to pay attention to what the kids needed and my husband<br/>\nwould take them to movies on the weekend, or out kite flying.   We<br/>\nworried that they were having a lousy time, but they came back the next<br/>\nsummer with fond memories and they&#39;ll be here again in four days.  ( Oh<br/>\ndear! )  <br/>\nKids are so adaptable.  If you don&#39;t despair and if you meet their needs<br/>\nthe best you can, they won&#39;t remember a horrible summer when their sister<br/>\nwas sick, they&#39;ll remember how cool it was to picnic in the back yard, or<br/>\nstay up late with you watching video&#39;s.

I love that<br/>\nquote, but am terrible at remembering where I picked<br/>\nup all the trinkets of wisdom that swirl in my mind.<br/>\n(Maybe, John Lennon.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat pretty much sums it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn&#39;t underestimate the level of compassion their<br/>\nsister&#39;s illness gives the rest of the family an<br/>\nopportunity to develop.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I can&#39;t think of a greater trait to<br/>\nnurture.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of us deal with some type of &quot;issue&quot; that impedes<br/>\nus from living out our &quot;perfect unschooler&quot; vision. <br/>\n<br/>\nMoney is a big one.  Wouldn&#39;t we all like to travel<br/>\n&#39;round the world with our children?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have 4. It is not fiscally possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime.  Many unschool parents must work.  Laundry and<br/>\ndishes and cleaning all take time. Especially for<br/>\nunschoolers who extrapolate not requiring chores as a<br/>\nfeature of the freedom they grant their children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s dandy if you have 1 or 2 children. <br/>\nMore than that and it becomes a physical<br/>\nimpossibility.  Family chores must be shared among<br/>\nable family members.  I think that assuming<br/>\nresponsibility is a Good Thing.  How else do we learn?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea of parent/tutor is a lovely and romantic one.<br/>\n I guess there are some households that are actually<br/>\nable to pull this off.  If mom gets up at 5 am to do<br/>\nall the cruddy housework and chores and can still<br/>\nmanage to put on a happy face when she serves the hot<br/>\nbreakfast at 8:30, followed by a day devoted to the<br/>\nindividual pursuits of an only child ...   Well, what<br/>\nchild wouldn&#39;t feel they&#39;d hit the jackpot?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they&#39;d end up completely egocentric and<br/>\nunappreciative of what was made to appear so<br/>\neffortless.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, &quot;unschooler&quot; is simply a word that I apply to<br/>\ndenote those in my household who must be legally<br/>\ndocumented- those 7-16 years old who are not attending<br/>\nschool.  We are all just Living.  Living our lives to<br/>\nthe fullest each and every day.  Some days are<br/>\nbetter-more enjoyable- than others.  Some days you&#39;d<br/>\nlike to get a re-do on.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOur outside activities used to be severely compromised<br/>\nby my youngest son.  He had Severe ADHD. (I have no<br/>\ninterest in going into that debate.)  Suffice it to<br/>\nsay, he is my 3rd son and he was not &quot;normal&quot; in<br/>\ncomparison to the other 2 ...  or any other child you<br/>\ncould comfortably take out in public.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, he is part of the family and so we all had to<br/>\nmake adjustments.  We did things at home.  We did as<br/>\nmuch as we could at home.  I arranged for the other 2<br/>\nto do things with friends and family.  I took them<br/>\nplaces when their dad was home.  Or, he took them<br/>\nplaces. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we HAD to go somewhere, Dr&#39;s, etc...   I would try<br/>\nto time it right and hold my breath that we didn&#39;t<br/>\npick a &quot;bad&quot; day.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was our life from the time he was 2-9.  He&#39;ll be<br/>\n10 next month and the severity of the behaviors has<br/>\nlessened dramatically.  Thank Goodness.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI assume since you are posting here that you have<br/>\ninternet access.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole world is right here.  No library in the<br/>\nworld has better research capabilities than the web.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s also a great place for kids to connect with<br/>\nothers who share their interests.  (Supervised of<br/>\ncourse)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo what you can and forget about what you can&#39;t.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo positive results will come from your torturing<br/>\nyourself over  the idyllic unschool family you&#39;d like<br/>\nto be.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd take comfort; they don&#39;t exist anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you give yourself permission to do the best<br/>\nthat you can each day,  plan activities/outings that<br/>\nare doable within your present life situation, and<br/>\nRELAX, you&#39;ll be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would try checking out local homeschool support<br/>\ngroups.  You might be able to find another family with<br/>\nvarious ages/interests  that you can trade off with. <br/>\nAn older sibling might enjoy the company of your<br/>\ndaughter while the mom could take your younger ones<br/>\nfor awhile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are endless opportunities, options and<br/>\npossibilities- once you let go of the one- that isn&#39;t<br/>\navailable to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat letting go is the hard part.  I know that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially as unschoolers, (that weird little minority<br/>\nof the already weird-enough  ; b  homeschooler<br/>\npopulation), we pressure ourselves to make it all<br/>\n&quot;work&quot;.  To be daily examples of &quot;the wonder of<br/>\nlearning&quot;, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the better you are at forgetting about<br/>\nthe label, &quot;unschooler&quot; ...  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd remembering that this is your life   ...  Every<br/>\nday is a new opportunity to be what you came to this<br/>\nplanet to be- Which is Completely up to you to decide<br/>\nand act on-<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more the Joyful and Abundant Opportunities will<br/>\npresent themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are there.

I feel some of the same frustrations<br/>\nwith 4 perfectly healthy kids.  Some of mine is due to my being less<br/>\norganized than I should be, and much of it is due to the vast number of<br/>\nactivities my kids participate in.  Some days are great, some days I<br/>\nfeel like I don&#39;t do near enough with my kids and that the months are<br/>\nslipping away from us way too fast.  But my kids still get so many great<br/>\nthings out of the life that we lead that I try not to guilt trip too<br/>\nmuch that it isn&#39;t as perfect as I&#39;d like.  And I think that if things<br/>\nare really going in a direction that makes you feel entirely<br/>\nuncomfortable, something that you can&#39;t predict right now will happen to<br/>\nchange your routines and take you in a different direction.  This is<br/>\nwhat I figure with our activity schedule.  Sometimes it makes me<br/>\nuncomfortable, but if it&#39;s not meant to be, it will change.  A kid will<br/>\nlose interest in something, or we&#39;ll run out of money, or a better<br/>\nopportunity will come along, or a conflict will intervene, or one of my<br/>\nlittle gymnasts will sprain something.  Not that I&#39;m wishing for<br/>\ninjuries, but I think that things end up taking the turns they need to<br/>\ntake.  I&#39;m not a religious person at all, but do think that life happens<br/>\nthe way it&#39;s supposed to.  You sound like you and your kids will be fine<br/>\nin the end.  Enjoy what you can, and don&#39;t feel guilty about the rest.<br/>\nAnd I have to take a kid to the gym now!<br/>\n <br/>\nLaurel in Burke, VA <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: Lisa Breger [mailto:lisa@...] <br/>\nSent: Thursday, June 06, 2002 11:51 AM<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] advice on life with an ill child<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\nAlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYour use of Yahoo!

I wanted to enjoy life TODAY, as you never really know how much time you have together as a family.  Ironically, as soon as I made this decision, my oldest daughter, then 13, came down with a virus.  The symptoms never went away, and after various guesses and many tests, we finally have a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia.  I won&#39;t go into the details, but it is a chronic illness, and my daughter has been bedridden for three months now.  I have three other children, ages 10, 7, and 2.  I have been focusing much of my time and energy trying to make sure their life is as normal as possible.  Fortunately, my 14 year old daughter can be left home alone for a few hours at a time, and my husband works close to home.  So as long as we take our cell phones, I can still get out of the house sometimes with the other kids.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I stand outside the situation, and look at it objectively, I can see that everything will work out in the end, and that unschooling will still be successful.  But I can&#39;t always look at it that way, and I am very worried.  I am not free to be with my kids in the way I would want to be.  My first challenge is having a two year old!  Although she won&#39;t be two forever, for now, it hinders many activities.  Next challenge is having to spend some time on the computer each day doing research on Fibromyalgia.  It is a fairly newly recognized illness, with no known cause or cure.  There is laundry, and general clean up. Then of course I do need to spend time with my oldest daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like I am not really providing the type of environment I would want for my kids.  Some days I don&#39;t even get a chance to read to them.  Since we are still new to unschooling, and the other freedoms I have given as an extension of the unschooling way of life, such as TV and Gameboy, etc.., they do spend much of their day watching TV.  My 7 year old son loves TV so much, and is sure that at any moment I will take away his freedom.  He can hardly be distracted, even to see a snake in our yard or tadpoles growing legs and becoming frogs!  I have read all the posts on TV, and I do trust that this is ok.  What I don&#39;t like is that I cannot watch it with him.  Maybe for a few minutes a day, but mostly he is on his own if he chooses to watch TV.  This does not feel good to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are not complaining about how their day plays out.  Maybe it would have been the same, even if my oldest wasn&#39;t sick. Maybe this is deschooling in action.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know my kids are learning things, such as compassion for the ill, and all about Fibromyalgia.  But I envisioned being able to offer them the world, and I can&#39;t.  We are very limited now in what we can do.  I spend about one hour a day with them. (When we are home)  I&#39;m with them more than that, but REALLY there and paying attention - about an hour.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan this still work?  Do others have days where your kids are pretty much unattended for most of the day?  Maybe I just need to make sure we get out of the house more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice or comments on unschooling life with a chronically ill child would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\nLisa Breger<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:lisa@...\">lisa@...</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7568,"nextTopicId":7565}}
