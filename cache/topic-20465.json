It&#39;s similar to them locking the school buildings only the <br/>\none entrance right in front of the office is left unlocked during <br/>\nschool time - to many problems with a student deciding to leave or a <br/>\nparent getting in and observing without having an &quot;escort&quot; from the <br/>\noffice, it happened once about 2 years ago in this district, a <br/>\nfather came in during school and didn&#39;t sign in with the office upon <br/>\narrival and quietly observed his child&#39;s classroom for a few minutes <br/>\nbefore he was &quot;found out&quot;, apparently he &quot;found out&quot; enough also <br/>\nbecause he immediately withdrew his child from that school and <br/>\nenrolled them in a local private school.<br/>\n    They say the locks are for the child&#39;s protection - I personally <br/>\nthink the children need more protection from the school. Even fire <br/>\ndoors are locked from the inside so a teacher has to unlock them <br/>\nbefore the children can leave the building for a fire drill. An <br/>\nolder child might be able to pull the lock but what if a small kindy <br/>\nor 1st grader was trying to get out in case of a fire? Their <br/>\nreasonings are beyond me! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso :<br/>\nIf SCHOOL did not exist:<br/>\n<br/>\n-the minimum work age would be lower -<br/>\n that and the amount of children competing for &quot;adult&quot; jobs were the <br/>\nmain reasons that the compulsory school laws were created in the <br/>\nfirst place around 100 years ago. Sure a few hopefuls thought they <br/>\nwere doing it to better the children but the work issue was the <br/>\nmajor reason it passed. <br/>\n   Now, not that I think 10 year olds should be working all day in a <br/>\nfactory but perhaps they could have cound a better solution than <br/>\nforcing all 10 year olds to be in a &quot;public school factory&quot; all day <br/>\ninstead. If you think about it 100 years isn&#39;t that much time sure <br/>\nuniversities and schools have been around for longer than that but <br/>\nthey&#39;re not compulsory - they were for those who chose to go! (And <br/>\nprobably had the $ too, nothing is simple.) How has the country <br/>\nbecome so addicted to something that is really such a young <br/>\nidea?      <br/>\n   Already most believe that it is the way it HAS to be, that you&#39;re <br/>\nclearly a law breaker if your child does anything other than public <br/>\nschool! But I suppose since the USA is only over 200 years old <br/>\nitself then half of that time has been spent compulsory schooling, <br/>\nit definately seems like another American fundamental thang. But I <br/>\nhaven&#39;t had much time to research many other countries either, that <br/>\ngives me someting interesting to research when I get the time.

The schedule could obviously affect <br/>\nsleepyness and this is just the beginning of the school year so I do <br/>\nagree with what you mentioned about waiting for awhile if their <br/>\nwords eventually match their mood. I&#39;m alo obviously not trusting <br/>\nthe parents enough to think that they will do the right thing by the <br/>\nchild, I know that is something I need to work on, I just see so <br/>\nmany parents who don&#39;t &quot;do right&quot; by their children sometimes I <br/>\napparently go on the child&#39;s defensive too quickly, obviously there <br/>\nis a parent who is trying to do the correct thing by the children in <br/>\nthis case. Sorry I jumped too quickly on that - I am trying to <br/>\nbalance my emotions which are definately running wild these days <br/>\nwith the &quot;back to school&quot; thang. It&#39;s just when a young child&#39;s <br/>\nwords don&#39;t match their actions it does make me suspicous. As a mom <br/>\nwho let her child try kindy because he wanted to and we have now <br/>\nsince delt with many of the side effects of the experience, I <br/>\nsuppose now I am so &quot;school&quot; scared that I just want to save any <br/>\nchild from the negative effects of school and from parents who put <br/>\ntheir children there with no chance of them ever getting them out <br/>\n(like a jail). But if my child had not have tried school then he may <br/>\nperhaps feel like he is &quot;missing out&quot; on something, he wouldn&#39;t have <br/>\nhis own experiences and reasonings to rely on as to why he doesn&#39;t <br/>\nwant to be in that situation. Perhaps we wouldn&#39;t have had the many <br/>\nconversations about what my son wanted to do to solve certain <br/>\nsituations, for going to &quot;school&quot; so little last year my son <br/>\ncertainly has &quot;learned&quot; a lot and I&#39;m not talking only the 3 Rs!  <br/>\nWhile my son was in kindy I made some extra money by substituting - <br/>\nI do have 3 college degrees one of which is a bachelors of <br/>\neducation -  frankly subbing was a pretty big eye opener for me as <br/>\nwell! Another way in which I would have probably not have known what <br/>\nwas going on. Sure I could think that schools are child friendly <br/>\nplaces and all teachers are caring helpful people, but I got to jump <br/>\ninto schools as one of them, in place of an absent one of them, <br/>\nalmost an equal - I did several &quot;class within classes&quot; which were <br/>\ncontinual shockers to me that the children are truely treated that <br/>\npoorly by the teachers. I saw many examples of children being yelled <br/>\nat and verbally abused (physical abuse was rarer but not <br/>\nnonexistant), as well as just frankly being treated with NO respect <br/>\nor that their opinions or interests mattered in the least. I <br/>\nwitnessed second graders being ordered to line up on the second <br/>\nblock and &quot;at attention&quot; - OOPs too late - No recess for you today <br/>\nyou better stop behaving like babies, you know better than playing <br/>\nlike that, if your regular music teacher was here she would make <br/>\nsure you weren&#39;t having fun like that! Or a high school student who <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have his planner had asked to go to the bathroom the teacher <br/>\nwas going to simply make him &quot;hold it&quot; all period - &quot;It will make <br/>\nhim learn to be more responsibe&quot; the teacher said - I said &quot;It will <br/>\nmake him learn not to share his problems with adults&quot; and wrote him <br/>\na pass anyway - Of course that particular school didn&#39;t call me back <br/>\nfor anothe day as a sub. but I could have cared less! I had a math <br/>\nteacher who was screaming at &quot;LD&quot; 9th grader because he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t &quot;getting&quot; a particular concept she was trying to teach - the <br/>\nchild kept raising his hand and she kept yelling at him that he <br/>\ndidn&#39;t need to ask any questions that he should be writing down his <br/>\nlessons. After watching the interaction for a few minutes I realized <br/>\nthe student was trying to ask for a piece of paper to try and <br/>\nsatisfy his raging teacher - I walked over and gave him one and he <br/>\nstarted working after he mouthed me a quick &quot;thank you&quot; the teacher <br/>\nglared at me for awhile before picking another student to torture. I <br/>\nhad this particular teacher&#39;s class one day when she was at a <br/>\nconference and converted the problems to $ instead of the way she <br/>\nhad them written and they made a lot of progress, you could actually <br/>\nsee them understanding the problems because $ was something that <br/>\nthey wanted to know how to deal with, I&#39;m not saying it would work <br/>\nwith all students, etc. but they were making progress, when I <br/>\ndropped my suggestion to the teacher in the teacher&#39;s lunchroom the <br/>\nnext day she said something to me along the lines of &quot;that&#39;s not <br/>\nreal math - that won&#39;t help them in the real world!&quot; I only <br/>\nsubstituted for the half a year my son went to kindy - only <br/>\noccasional days and when my son wanted to go to school which became <br/>\nless and less as time went on because he simply didn&#39;t like being <br/>\ntreated as though his feelings an opinions didn&#39;t matter. But what I <br/>\nsaw in the schools when I substituted was enough for me to realize <br/>\nthat schools really arn&#39;t places where kids learn - they&#39;re places <br/>\nwhere kids are housed while their parents work or somewhere they&#39;re <br/>\nsent because someone thinks &quot;it&#39;s for their own good&quot;, they&#39;re <br/>\ncomparable to a factory that turns out &quot;compliant workers&quot; or <br/>\nthey&#39;re a kindof jail to keep them off of the streets and out of <br/>\ngrown ups way but they are NOT places where children learn anything <br/>\nother than to not think for themselves. If I hadn&#39;t have substituted <br/>\nthen I wouldn&#39;t have known that things really are THAT BAD, I would <br/>\nhave possibly thought they weren&#39;t good but now I KNOW.   <br/>\nI&#39;m sorry that I have written a book  - obviously I have a problem <br/>\nwith schools and I will have as long as it is obvious teachers feel <br/>\nthat it is okey for them to behave in this manner or it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>\nso universal in all the schools. <br/>\n<br/>\n--- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;J.
