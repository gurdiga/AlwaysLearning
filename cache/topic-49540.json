In most places in the world there isn&#39;t enough<br/>\nfood, even what we consider &quot;junk food&quot; or unhealthy food.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you are in this dilemma and are looking for permission to stop your<br/>\nson from drinking soda, I don&#39;t think that will happen.  Essentially, you<br/>\nhold the winning hand and you can either trust you son to figure it out or<br/>\nnot.  We aren&#39;t your conscience, and you need to play the hand as its<br/>\ndealt.  I don&#39;t want to tell you what to do.  You are obviously torn by who<br/>\nyou want to be and all the doubts.  It is better for your son if you figure<br/>\nthis out before you deliver ultimatums.  The idea that this week mom is<br/>\ngiving me all I can drink, but next week its nothing but water will drive<br/>\nhim to drink more than he may want in preparation for the coming dry spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou cannot get people on this list to agree to stopping your son from<br/>\ndrinking pop.  That&#39;s okay though.  All they give is their experience or<br/>\nopinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want to call yourself an unschooler.  We all get that, but if its<br/>\ncausing you a lot of grief step back and figure out what about this doesn&#39;t<br/>\nsit well with soda pop drinking.  You need to ask yourself what is behind<br/>\nyour fears.  Can you get your son tested to see if he is at risk for<br/>\ndiabetes?  If we guaranteed he couldn&#39;t get sick how would you change your<br/>\nbehavior?  Maybe that&#39;s the thing you need to know.  Are you sure this is<br/>\nnot about something other than health?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

It may not happen <br/>\nif he drinks soda, especially if he is active. It may still happen in the <br/>\nabsence of soda because it runs in your family. If he is hearing your <br/>\ncertainty, it might be in his natural temperment to want to prove things for <br/>\nhimself. That means that you are setting up a situation where one or the <br/>\nother of you will have to be proven wrong. That&#39;s not a good thing for your <br/>\nrelationship or his long term health.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; In particular I remember you saying that you asked Holly to wait until <br/>\nafter dinner to have a sweet snack she was about to eat.  You must have <br/>\nthought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice.  I was also suggesting to my son <br/>\nthat he drink other things in addition to soda, and he got really upset. <br/>\nThen I tried to explain why.  He didn&#39;t care.  I was under the impression <br/>\nthat Holly acquiesced because in general she was not given food <br/>\nrestrictions, so she was willing to do what you wanted in that case.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra has many beautiful stories of Holly, Marty and Kirby acquiescing <br/>\ngraciously to her few requests, because of the long build up of trust <br/>\nbetween her and her kids. She didn&#39;t have years of control to undo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes kids have different temperaments from Holly. Jayn (10) is very <br/>\ndifferent. She reacts vigorously to many requests that she change some piece <br/>\nof behavior, because she sees them as an attempt at control, even though <br/>\nthey are just requests and based on something real (like the time of day or <br/>\nmy headache). This is even though we don&#39;t have years of control to undo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes Jayn apparently needs to go through the process of proving to <br/>\nherself that she is free to say no (and she is), and come around slowly to <br/>\nsaying yes. She almost always does acquiese after this transitional <br/>\n&quot;defiant&quot; moment. (I don&#39;t think of it as &quot;defiance&quot;, my mother would have! <br/>\nProbably conventional parents witnessing it would.))<br/>\n<br/>\nThis happens more when she has been out and about in contact with kids and <br/>\nhomes where there are fewer real choices given to the kids, rules, odd <br/>\narbritrary restrictions. It&#39;s as if she has to reassure herself that her <br/>\nlife is still free. Or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Jayn will usually acquiese, but not always graciously at first. She will <br/>\nacquiese because once she has understood that she doesn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;, then <br/>\nshe can see the sense in the request. Or she can make a reasoned and sane <br/>\narguement based on her prior experience why she won&#39;t agree or comply. Or <br/>\nshe comes up with a nice compromise that I hadn&#39;t considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t ask a lot of her. I almost never make any remarks about her food <br/>\nchoices. If she has a tummy upset at any time, we will talk about the <br/>\ntimeline, and what she ate and make connections. We recently came to the <br/>\nstill fuzzy conclusion that the sugar free kool-aid is probably making her <br/>\npoops liquid (a known effect of some artificial sweetners fo some people. I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t mean to buy the sugar free for that reason.) It was her realization, <br/>\nafter we were talking over all that she had consumed over several days. I <br/>\nwon&#39;t have to then restrict her kool aid consumption. She will happily do <br/>\nthat for herself - unless she feels constipated. Then she might see it <br/>\nmedicinally.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe would not be happy if I were directing her not to have kool aid. She <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t like being told much more than she wouldn&#39;t like tummyache. That is <br/>\nsomething that is inside her, Who She Is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been moments in my earlier life here on these lists with a <br/>\nschool-age unschooler for now 5 years (counting Kindergarten) when I have <br/>\nhad a certain amount of frustration because it seemed like I was doing all <br/>\nthe same things, broadly, as Sandra, but my little girl wasn&#39;t becoming as <br/>\nsweet and easy going as Holly. Jayn almost never in her life just says yes. <br/>\nComparing one kid to another isn&#39;t a path to inner peace.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t magically change your child&#39;s temperament. It doesn&#39;t <br/>\nmagically make a strong willed child into an easy going child. It can <br/>\nsupport your child&#39;s strong will, so that they get to be as happy and feel <br/>\nas easy going inside themselves as an easy going kid.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling allows me to look with wonder and joy at my real child, who will <br/>\nnever be Holly but I think is just as cool in her own way. She will grow up <br/>\nknowing herself, what she needs to be happy and what she needs to do when <br/>\nshe feels frustrated and unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, a battle over soda, or any food, is just not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt; His reaction was extreme for a 12-year-old &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n12 is often the start of puberty.

You must have thought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice. I was also suggesting to my son that he drink other things in addition to soda, and he got really upset.***<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big big difference here is that Holly grew up without anyone controlling what she ate.  I imagine she was hungry and came into the kitchen to find some food, the easiest and most available may have been cookies.  Sandra, probably, in an informative way said, &quot;hey wait, because food is almost ready.&quot;, then Holly waited because she probably prefered filling up on food other than cookies.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour son hasn&#39;t had that.  He&#39;s upset and reacting to control which is a way different place to be in than Holly was.  If my husband told me that he felt it best that I only drink one cup of coffee a day  and then proceeded to make sure I followed these orders, it wouldn&#39;t be very relationship building and I might tell him to &quot;f**k off and mind your own business&quot;.  A mom can do the same thing to a kid and the kid may react in a similar fashion, maybe not yet as balsy to say something so direct, but they&#39;d certainly FEEL that sentiment and get really upset and cry about it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve seen over the years, is that kids who grow up like this, will often go one of 2 ways.. they either quietly accept what the parents tell them to do and then be sneaky about it or die a little inside, OR they outrightly rebel.  Neither of those seem like acceptable relationship building things.  I have a great relationship with my teenager, largely because I never did that &quot;do what I say&quot; controlling thing.  I took into account what SHE wanted and trusted her that she knew enough about herself to know that she knew what she was talking about.  When she makes mistakes, that&#39;s all they are, and I&#39;m here as a soft landing.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Every parent, including you, who has advocated freedom for their kids to eat what they feel they need, has also tried to gently steer them in healthy directions by putting out fruits, for example, or asking them to eat something substantial (like dinner) before eating sweets. That&#39;s the path I&#39;m trying to take, but it&#39;s hard right now. ***<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t gently steer my kids.  They aren&#39;t horses or cows.  They are thinking individuals with individual likes and dislikes and varying needs and wants.  If I think they might like some fruit, I&#39;ll put it out there for them.  The latest on our grocery list requests has been exactly that, in the middle of winter, but hey, we do what we can even if they want strawberries.  I have never told my kids to eat something substantial before they eat anything else.  They eat when they are hungry and generally what sounds good to them at any given time which may or may not be what I&#39;ve prepared as a meal.  My youngest daughter will often eat cookies with or before she eats a more regular meal.  Sometimes she&#39;ll eat chocolate all day one day and very little else and the next day eat zero chocolate or other sweet delights and eat sandwhiches and fruit and yogurt and fish tacos and salad and carrot sticks raw without dip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way it will cease being hard is if you stop fretting about it and trying to control things.  That actually makes living way more difficult than it needs to be.  You CAN be more relaxed and happily allow your kids and yourself to eat what you and they want.  If you are concerned about diabetes, even better to release the control and really allow your children to listen to what their bodies are telling them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Unschooling principles and special circumstances (long)","postDate":"1263408341","msgId":49564,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCNEUxNEQ1LjkwODA2MDhAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhpa3M5Zis3NGlqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhpa3M5Zis3NGlqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":49561,"nextInTopic":49566,"prevInTime":49563,"nextInTime":49565,"topicId":49540,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

If I make a big salmon salad, am I trying to  <br/>\ngently steer my husband in a healthy direction?  I&#39;m probably taking  <br/>\nnote of the fact that we&#39;ve  had meat and potatoes one night, and then  <br/>\npizza the next, and it&#39;s about time for greens and fish.  That&#39;s not  <br/>\nme being manipulative. That&#39;s me being a good partner, a better  <br/>\nprovider, and thoughtful mate.  If I give him salad every night and  <br/>\ntell him he has no business eating pizza, or that salmon is better for  <br/>\nhim than beef, then I&#39;m being an adversary.  He will go and have a  <br/>\npizza with sausage and ground beef somewhere else, where I&#39;m not  <br/>\nlooking.

I have let him make his choices, and now I&#39;m way past my comfort zone, I&#39;m worried, and I don&#39;t know what to do.  You have said before that you have made food suggestions to your kids.  In particular I remember you saying that you asked Holly to wait until after dinner to have a sweet snack she was about to eat.  You must have thought she wasn&#39;t making a good choice.  I was also suggesting to my son that he drink other things in addition to soda, and he got really upset.  Then I tried to explain why.  He didn&#39;t care.  I was under the impression that Holly acquiesced because in general she was not given food restrictions, so she was willing to do what you wanted in that case.  My son wasn&#39;t willing to do that.

Linnaea really likes soda, has for a long time. We have a seltzer bottle thing and syrups so we can make our own soda, too, but those never seem to be as appealling to her as a Dr. Pepper or a Sprite. She doesn&#39;t like water and isn&#39;t that keen on juice, although she really likes the pink, Discovery apple juice a local apple juicer bottles in the autumn. Because of her preference for soda we keep bottles of soda in. We go through, at a guess--I&#39;m not keeping score, up to three 2-liter bottles a week unless there is a sleepover and then it goes up a bit. It&#39;s been a little less lately as there has been a focus on koolaid and apple juice. Because of her preference for soda we&#39;ve tried brewing ginger ale, it didn&#39;t work, and I really want to get a hold of root beer extract and brew root beer. I can&#39;t get it in the UK and the last time we were in the US I didn&#39;t get over to a brew shop as I got distracted by the conference we were<br/>\n attending. It&#39;ll happen, sometime. Oh, and Simon loves Mountain Dew and was really excited when we found it at an asian grocery in the &quot;big city&quot; near us, bottled in the Phillipines, with thicker plastic than the stuff we buy that&#39;s bottled in the UK. <br/>\n<br/>\nLinnaea likes other drinks as well. She likes lassi and she likes chai tea and she likes thai ice tea and a nice cuppa regular tea with milk and sugar. She likes to go into the tea shop and pick out different teas to brew up at home. Her world of fluids isn&#39;t just soda, but she does like soda. I&#39;m guessing she always will. It doesn&#39;t make her unhealthy, it doesn&#39;t make her less able to recover from illness, it doesn&#39;t make her more prone to highs and lows. She likes soda and she likes to have it regularly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know a woman who gets upset about drinking coke. She really likes an ice cold coke, but she punishes herself everytime she has one. Coke tastes of guilt and calories that she doesn&#39;t want and obesity and diabetes to her. It isn&#39;t just the pleasure of carbonated syrupy water, it&#39;s all this baggage. Linnaea gets to have coke that is guilt-free. And so do I. I really prefer that. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: Jenny Cyphers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jenstarc4@...\">jenstarc4@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Wednesday, 13 January, 2010 8:06:47<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Unschooling principles and special circumstances (long)<br/>\n<br/>\n***Eventually we agreed that we would do a week-long experiment: He could have all the soda he wants, but he agrees to drink an equal amount of water.

Here&#39;s my story:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I don&#39;t drink soda, so we never had it in the house.  The kiddos like it, so they would order it when we ate out at restaurants or at fast food joints.  I was OK with that.  Then my son (now 12) asked if we could buy it at the supermarket and have it in the house.  So we started buying a 2-liter bottle each week, the kiddos would have it when they wanted it (usually with dinner), and when we ran out they would have something else until we went shopping again.  Then ds asked if we could buy more soda so that we wouldn&#39;t run out during the week.  So we did.  Then kiddos started asking to drink soda during lunch, too.  OK.  Then it was several glasses of soda during meals for ds, plus more whenever he felt thirsty.  Nowadays soda is all he drinks (really), and that was too much for me.  Today he wanted a third glass during lunch, and I told him he might want to slow down because we were almost out.  He said we could go to the store and get more, and I said I didn&#39;t want to do that because I bought plenty of soda to get us through the week, and if we&#39;re running out, it means we&#39;re drinking too much soda.....<br/>\n<br/>\nMeltdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that if I didn&#39;t put restrictions on soda (or other food), ds would find some kind of balance with it.  It&#39;s working out that way with my neuro-typical daughter, but my son says he doesn&#39;t like water any more, and he&#39;s bored with orange juice.  I tried to talk to him about other drinks that would still be fun to drink, but have a little less sugar, or about drinking soda PLUS other things like water, milk, and juice.  He said he&#39;d rather die than have any limits put on him.  He says he doen&#39;t care about disease or obesity or health in general, and it&#39;s his body, and if he&#39;s OK with the consequences of drinking lots of soda, nobody else should worry about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually we agreed that we would do a week-long experiment:  He could have all the soda he wants, but he agrees to drink an equal amount of water.  I feel good that we came to this agreement and I didn&#39;t make any ultimatums or anything, but when you get right down to it, I&#39;m putting restrictions on him.  It made me wonder whether trusting our kids to know what&#39;s right for them is really applicable in all cases where the kid has Asperger Syndrome or depression or something like that.  My own conclusion is that parents can trust their kiddos to know what they need and make choices for themselves, but in SOME cases, for SOME issues, other mental or emotional issues get in the way of a kid knowing what&#39;s best for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wondering what you all thought about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeth C.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":49630,"nextTopicId":49307}}
