It helps, it really, really helps to find joy in the things your children do. <br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, in front of the television, there are a slew of oragami papers and markers and paper dolls and other bits and bobs from Linnaea crafting one or another thing. As I peer closer I can see a bird she made and drawings she&#39;s drawn and planes she designed as toys for the kittens. I will probably go over and tidy it up in a little bit, to keep the pieces safer from folks walking around and to make sure that there isn&#39;t food for the ants. It takes only a moment to turn what you describe as rubble into a series of activities, of joyous moments. They are still lifes waiting to be interpreted. I can see the shadow of her sitting there and doing and making and talking and turning to Simon to show him or running to fly the plane she made in the hallway to see if it would fly well enough to engage whichever kitten it was designed to amuse, or calling to me to come and interpret whichever fold the origami book was describing onto the paper she was folding.<br/>\n It isn&#39;t rubble, it is her life. <br/>\n<br/>\n----------------------<br/>\nI honestly will have a hard time keeping him in <br/>\nclean socks if I don&#39;t have some cooperation from him.<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does that mean? It&#39;s summer, right? It isn&#39;t much of a season for socks, clean or otherwise. Go buy tons of socks, find them on sale, don&#39;t worry about quality, get quantity. Put them near the washing machine and bring him pairs every time you wash his clothes. Fill his drawers with socks. Make him feel rich in socks. It won&#39;t cost a lot. It seems a very strange moan needing cooperation to keep him in socks. They are just socks. Just minutia. Just a small thing to make his life better and more comfortable. Not something to need cooperation to obtain. <br/>\n<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n (His cousin was <br/>\nthe worst, though, 6 months after he was no longer even living at our <br/>\nhouse I&#39;d still find one of his socks every time a moved something in a <br/>\ncorner or under a chair! The boy must have actively thrown his socks in <br/>\nrandom directions every time he took them off.)<br/>\n-------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nMove all the furniture and see if there are still some socks around and wash them and offer them to this boy who lacks clean socks. What a wonderful way to remember this house guest, to picture him winging his socks around as he felt his toes freed. Maybe he hated his socks and it was such joy to get them off that he couldn&#39;t help but make them fly!<br/>\n <br/>\n------------------<br/>\nMaybe we&#39;ll just budget <br/>\na pack of socks for the boy every week or two until we&#39;re more balanced? <br/>\n------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, good idea. I don&#39;t know what your balance has to do with it, but definitely if he needs more socks buy him more socks. <br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------<br/>\nOtherwise he&#39;ll just have to tolerate wearing dirty socks (which I can&#39;t <br/>\nstand myself, I hate dirty socks the most, I think).<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he is different than you, right? So maybe it isn&#39;t that which he hates the most. Maybe dirty socks are kind of comfortable. Maybe finding two that match is exciting, or being cool and indifferent and wearing whatever was on the floor appeals. Maybe going barefoot is better. Maybe he likes shoes without socks sometimes. Maybe there is more between buying and tolerating. Maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler <br/>\nwww.waynforth.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":286713246,"authorName":"Melissa Dietrick","from":"&quot;Melissa Dietrick&quot; &lt;melissa.dietrick@...&gt;","profile":"melidi7","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Telling our kids the answers vs. having them figure it out themselves","postDate":"1215754144","msgId":36390,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGc1NnIzMCtuamZrQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDM3OUQ1NzBDLUM1RjctNDI5QS05NUIzLUY0NUY2N0QzOUFCM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":36378,"nextInTopic":36392,"prevInTime":36389,"nextInTime":36391,"topicId":36253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... this is beautiful. ... this one takes me to a dead end. ... another excellent page from an excellent site :o) When I move thru your site, I feel like a","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1676619104\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/morning\">http://sandradodd.com/morning</a><br/>\n </span></blockquote>this is beautiful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/play\">http://sandradodd.com/play</a><br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>this one takes me to a dead end.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/checklists\">http://sandradodd.com/checklists</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n </span></blockquote>another excellent page from an excellent site :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I move thru your site, I feel like a child in a candy store, or<br/>\nlike Im in a fantastic meandering castle with hidden secret rooms and<br/>\nmagic doors to new realities...<br/>\n<br/>\nmelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;What was I thinking&quot; was Telling our kids the answers vs. having them figure it out themselves","postDate":"1215731892","msgId":36378,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMUMxMkYyLTE5OEEtNDQ1Qy1BODZGLUNCQzdGNDUyMzJDMUB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ4NzY2N0E4LjIwNzAxMDdAZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNhOS4yYmM1ZWUxMS4zNWEzOWY0MkBhb2wuY29tPiA8NDg3M0VCNEIuOTA3MDgwMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+IDwwRkQyQjMwMi00NDUyLTQxN0EtODdDNC01RkJFMzc0QTBERjZAbWFjLmNvbT4gPDg3ZTkxOWI2MDgwNzA5MTExMHhlZGY5Yzk1b2JmMTNkMTcwYWY3YzVhMWVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDw0ODc1NkEwNy42MDcwMTA2QGdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPDQ4NzY2N0E4LjIwNzAxMDdAZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":36373,"nextInTopic":36390,"prevInTime":36377,"nextInTime":36379,"topicId":36253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

But you guys aren&#39;t my mother <br/>\nand I truly appreciate suggestions for how I can be better and better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does help to have somewhere to talk about the process we&#39;re going <br/>\nthrough, though. Just writing things out helps me see stuff I wouldn&#39;t <br/>\nhave seen otherwise. Yesterday, I was with the youngest most of the <br/>\nday--her siblings were overnighting at friends (today is the opposite). <br/>\nWe both felt a little down and bluesy (probably because we&#39;re both short <br/>\non sleep from the new &quot;no bedtime&quot; &lt;g&gt;). But there&#39;s also emotionally <br/>\nupsetting stuff going on right now (or the ongoing upsetting situation <br/>\nis in a &quot;flare up&quot;). I helped her find stuff to do but I just didn&#39;t <br/>\nfeel very fun to be around. We did the newspaper logs thing but my <br/>\nattitude was more like it was a chore than a fun project.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my new level of understanding is that I first need to find stuff that <br/>\n*I* enjoy doing and is fun for me that I can do with the kids. Not that <br/>\nnewspaper logs wouldn&#39;t be fun for me if I let them be fun but I wanted <br/>\nto take it over and do what I wanted. And we were short on tape and <br/>\nnewspaper. So today I think I&#39;ll try to buy enough newspaper and tape so <br/>\nthat there&#39;s enough for me to play and enjoy the way I want and whatever <br/>\nkid wants to join in can join in with mine or make their own or <br/>\nsomething like. Making it all &quot;I&#39;ll help you with your project&quot; sapped <br/>\nall the fun out of it for me yesterday and left her frustrated when what <br/>\nshe wanted to do didn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; (her word). The structure she chose to <br/>\nbuild was wobbly and unstable and some of the joins tore apart from lack <br/>\nof tape but my suggestions that she add tape, etc had been met with <br/>\nresistance, so I kept them to a minimum--she wanted to &quot;do her own <br/>\nthing&quot; so I just tried to be supportive (literally by holding up pieces <br/>\nshe was joining, etc.).

He would leave<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his teacup sitting next to his chair almost every evening and, in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; past, I&#39;d picked it up in the morning and rinsed it and put it into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the dishwasher. For years. He also often left a little bowl of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sunflower seed shells and I&#39;d put those in the compost bucket and<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rinse the dish and put it into the dishwasher.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When he bugged me a lot not to pick up after the kids - I stopped<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; picking up after HIM! &lt;G&gt; There would sometimes be four or five<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teacups sitting there by his chair. Sometimes the dog would get into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his sunflower seed shells and make a mess and I&#39;d leave that too. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t doing this out of spite - but just somehow, without realizing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, I wasn&#39;t getting around to taking care of it. It hit me like a ton<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of bricks, one day, that I was doing this. So, I started cleaning up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beside his chair again and, next time he said something about cleaning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up after the kids I just said, &quot;You know - we all clean up after each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other and I think that&#39;s nice. I clean up your stuff from beside your<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chair every morning and I&#39;m happy to do it. You empty the bathroom<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trash even though most of the trash in it isn&#39;t even yours, and I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really appreciate that. I think we&#39;re fine - the kids are learning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that we all help each other out, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He grumbled a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little more - using the usual expressions - &quot;They need to learn we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not their servants,&quot; and stuff like that. But I let it slide because I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know that he does that - he grumbles a little, but then he goes off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks about what I said and often it sinks in. He&#39;s logical, if<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it makes sense, he&#39;ll get it - I don&#39;t try to argue him into things<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (anymore).<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, the more we bug the kids to pick up their own stuff, the more<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused they get on what&#39;s &quot;theirs&quot; and what isn&#39;t. Yesterday I asked<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Roxana if she&#39;d mind sweeping the bathroom floor - something had<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spilled. She said she&#39;d do it (I was leaving, she was staying home.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later, I thanked her and she said something about not having even been<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in that bathroom for months and I suddenly realized - she doesn&#39;t even<br/>\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use that bathroom. But still she swept up for me, just to be nice.

My <br/>\nrecollection is hazy, but her wisdom was to do it with a smile.  Pick up <br/>\nthe stuff the kids don&#39;t and just do it with a smile.  Frankly, I found <br/>\nit easier to just pick the stuff up than to get into an argument about <br/>\nit where no one feels good afterward.  Our son is older now, and he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t quite get one of the main reasons we&#39;ve always given (we like it <br/>\nclean because it make us feel better about our home), and that&#39;s because <br/>\nit&#39;s not something he can relate to.  otoh, our house is on the market <br/>\nand he does understand why the house needs to be clean - mainly because <br/>\nhe cares about the outcome (moving to Costa Rica).  Doesn&#39;t mean he <br/>\nreally helps keep it clean 24/7, but he has been helping now from time <br/>\nto time.<br/>\n<br/>\nArp<br/>\n<br/>\nwww.unschoold.com | www.tinygrass.com<br/>\nArp: the Unschooled Vagabond <br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/unschooledvagabond/%7E6/1\">http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/unschooledvagabond/%7E6/1</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nbarbara emrich wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; Great post!

Sometimes the dog would get into<br/>\n&gt; &gt; his sunflower seed shells and make a mess and I&#39;d leave that too. I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t doing this out of spite - but just somehow, without realizing<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it, I wasn&#39;t getting around to taking care of it. It hit me like a ton<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of bricks, one day, that I was doing this. So, I started cleaning up<br/>\n&gt; &gt; beside his chair again and, next time he said something about cleaning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; up after the kids I just said, &quot;You know - we all clean up after each<br/>\n&gt; &gt; other and I think that&#39;s nice.

I think we&#39;re fine - the kids are learning<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that we all help each other out, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He grumbled a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; little more - using the usual expressions - &quot;They need to learn we&#39;re<br/>\n&gt; &gt; not their servants,&quot; and stuff like that. But I let it slide because I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; know that he does that - he grumbles a little, but then he goes off<br/>\n&gt; &gt; and thinks about what I said and often it sinks in.

Then I had 3 kids ....one of them happens to be autistic, nonverbal and Oh does he love to make messes &lt;g&gt;. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I spent the longest time felling so overwhelmed and felt I had to make my kids pitch in. They could at least get *their* stuff cleaned up ...I was having to clean so much. <br/>\n  One day I realized that while I dont enjoy other people having negative opinions when they come to my trashy house my kids emotional well being was far more important. I also realized that to me having kids who remember a mom that ( insert fun activity here ) was far more important than letting myself get spazed out about a messy house. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  So I gave myself permission to let go , stopped demanding, and for a while didnt even ask my kids to do anything. I did things around my house that made life easier for me ..like the dishes cause Im not a friend of bugs :) but I took lots of deep breathed and learned to stop stressing about everything. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Time went by where I was the only one doing any housework and I had to work hard to choose hapiness and not feel resentful. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Then my kids did start doing things without being asked. Nate made a big mess in his room smearing stuff on the walls and in the carpet. I got in there and started shampooing the carpet and Alyssa came and asked if she could clean the walls. I got her a spray bottle then Courtney went and found another a few minutes later and started helping. She got tired of the walls and offered to run the shampooer so we switched for a while. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Grandma is coming down tomorrow and yesterday Courtney asked if Id help her clean their room up. Their bikes , scooters and wagons have been out in the yard for a few days now. No one reminded them or asked them to but a few minutes ago when it started to rain they ran outside and pulled them all up under the porch real quick. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Now their shoes? They still get left wherever and it was a pain when we had to take dad to work and didnt have time to search the house for shoes. I took on old pair for each kid and tossed them in the back of the van so if we needed them we&#39;d have shoes. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Nicole <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n<br/>\n       <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":321346721,"authorName":"barbara emrich","from":"&quot;barbara emrich&quot; &lt;barbaraemrich@...&gt;","profile":"barbaraemrich","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;What was I thinking&quot; was Telling our kids the answers vs. having them figure it out themselves","postDate":"1215627038","msgId":36329,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg3ZTkxOWI2MDgwNzA5MTExMHhlZGY5Yzk1b2JmMTNkMTcwYWY3YzVhMWVAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDBGRDJCMzAyLTQ0NTItNDE3QS04N0M0LTVGQkUzNzRBMERGNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGNhOS4yYmM1ZWUxMS4zNWEzOWY0MkBhb2wuY29tPiA8NDg3M0VCNEIuOTA3MDgwMEBnbWFpbC5jb20+CSA8MEZEMkIzMDItNDQ1Mi00MTdBLTg3QzQtNUZCRTM3NEEwREY2QG1hYy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36324,"nextInTopic":36335,"prevInTime":36328,"nextInTime":36330,"topicId":36253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Great post!

Not what you want them to learn, but they&#39;ll learn from  <br/>\nyour behavior. My husband had a hard time with this. He&#39;d see me  <br/>\npicking up the kids&#39; shoes or other &quot;droppings&quot; and he&#39;d say, &quot;They  <br/>\nshould pick that up for themselves, you should be doing it for them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, you know what that made ME want to do? He would leave  <br/>\nhis teacup sitting next to his chair almost every evening and, in the  <br/>\npast, I&#39;d picked it up in the morning and rinsed it and put it into  <br/>\nthe dishwasher. For years. He also often left a little bowl of  <br/>\nsunflower seed shells and I&#39;d put those in the compost bucket and  <br/>\nrinse the dish and put it into the dishwasher.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he bugged me a lot not to pick up after the kids - I stopped  <br/>\npicking up after HIM! &lt;G&gt; There would sometimes be four or five  <br/>\nteacups sitting there by his chair. Sometimes the dog would get into  <br/>\nhis sunflower seed shells and make a mess and I&#39;d leave that too. I  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t doing this out of spite - but just somehow, without realizing  <br/>\nit, I wasn&#39;t getting around to taking care of it. It hit me like a ton  <br/>\nof bricks, one day, that I was doing this. So, I started cleaning up  <br/>\nbeside his chair again and, next time he said something about cleaning  <br/>\nup after the kids I just said, &quot;You know - we all clean up after each  <br/>\nother and I think that&#39;s nice. I clean up your stuff from beside your  <br/>\nchair every morning and I&#39;m happy to do it. You empty the bathroom  <br/>\ntrash even though most of the trash in it isn&#39;t even yours, and I  <br/>\nreally appreciate that. I think we&#39;re fine - the kids are learning  <br/>\nthat we all help each other out, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He grumbled a  <br/>\nlittle more - using the usual expressions - &quot;They need to learn we&#39;re  <br/>\nnot their servants,&quot; and stuff like that. But I let it slide because I  <br/>\nknow that he does that - he grumbles a little, but then he goes off  <br/>\nand thinks about what I said and often it sinks in. He&#39;s logical, if  <br/>\nit makes sense, he&#39;ll get it - I don&#39;t try to argue him into things  <br/>\n(anymore).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the more we bug the kids to pick up their own stuff, the more  <br/>\nfocused they get on what&#39;s &quot;theirs&quot; and what isn&#39;t. Yesterday I asked  <br/>\nRoxana if she&#39;d mind sweeping the bathroom floor - something had  <br/>\nspilled. She said she&#39;d do it (I was leaving, she was staying home.)  <br/>\nLater, I thanked her and she said something about not having even been  <br/>\nin that bathroom for months and I suddenly realized - she doesn&#39;t even  <br/>\nuse that bathroom. But still she swept up for me, just to be nice. If  <br/>\nI&#39;d been saying, &quot;Pick up your own shoes, I&#39;m not doing it for you,  <br/>\nthey&#39;re YOURS,&quot; to her, she&#39;d have said, &quot;Sweep your own bathroom, it  <br/>\nis YOURS not MINE.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do the kids learn when you force them to pick up their own stuff  <br/>\nand refuse to do it for them? They learn to be ungenerous with their  <br/>\ntime, and unhelpful (with other people&#39;s stuff). They learn to be more  <br/>\nselfish, not more responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;What was I thinking&quot; was Telling our kids the answers vs. having them figure it out themselves","postDate":"1215621544","msgId":36320,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEIzRjZCQ0VDLTJFOTEtNEMxNC05MTczLTNBODdFQkU3QUU3NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM4ZTFkMyQxMmZhNmQxMCQwMzAwMDAwYUBTUEFNPg==","referencesHeader":"PDAwMDYwMWM4ZTFkMyQxMmZhNmQxMCQwMzAwMDAwYUBTUEFNPg=="},"prevInTopic":36314,"nextInTopic":36322,"prevInTime":36319,"nextInTime":36321,"topicId":36253,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1826829058\">-=-&lt;&lt;&lt;You&#39;d think I&#39;d have &quot;learned&quot;.

Yuck.<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes, my dad would say something to the effect of, &quot;Let&#39;s go get the  <br/>\nencyclopedia and see.&quot; When that happened, we often spent at least 20 minutes,  <br/>\nsometimes an entire afternoon looking at things in the set, one thing leading <br/>\nto  another, Dad&#39;s experiences being shared and filling the &quot;search&quot; periods. <br/>\nIt was  truly &quot;connections&quot; as one thing led to another which led to another <br/>\nand yet  another.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;First reason: they are less likely to seek out the <br/>\nanswers  for themselves. What will they do when I am no longer around? <br/>\nAsk another  person???&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nI always gladly spell whatever my son asks me to-even using a dictionary or  <br/>\nspellcheck to make certain that I&#39;m correct. It hasn&#39;t yet hampered his desire <br/>\n to look things up, learn or his desire to acquire knowledge. It definitely <br/>\nhelps  him keep the flow in his projects. It also solidifies our relationship <br/>\nso that  he knows if he needs help with anything, I am always willing to <br/>\nhelp-even if I  need to get help myself to help *him*. And I *love* looking things <br/>\nup together  with him! I&#39;m sure I will with his younger brother as well, when <br/>\nthat time  comes.<br/>\n <br/>\nI don&#39;t plan on not being around for my son to ask for a mighty long time,  <br/>\nyet. By the time I&#39;m no longer around, he should have a full understanding of  <br/>\nthe many, varied ways he can find the answers he seeks. And asking for help  <br/>\nwon&#39;t be something taboo or to be avoided because it was required. I feel <br/>\ngiving  my son answers or looking them up with him is a joy and another way to not <br/>\nonly  spend time with him, but to show him that learning need never stop and <br/>\nthat it  is fun as well as something people can do together-not a lonely chore <br/>\none has  had foisted upon them. If I were gone, I would heartily hope that he <br/>\nwould ask  someone else! If he had a need, I would want him to ask, not keep <br/>\nsilent and  feel that he should know or be able to figure something out on his <br/>\nown. Or  heaven forbid-that it was shameful to ask.<br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Second reason: I want them to RELY on their <br/>\nability to find  the &quot;right&quot; answer for them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nOnce I knew how to look something up, I knew how. I didn&#39;t need years of  <br/>\nrepeating the process to &quot;ingrain&quot; it in my brain. A handful of tries and I was  <br/>\nconfident in my ability to use that source and find the answer(s) I was  <br/>\nseeking. It&#39;s fairly simple-well, it was in those days. There is a vast  wellspring <br/>\nof resources now, and the difficulty may be in choosing one or two! <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Third reason: Seeking <br/>\nanswers aids in development of  critical thinking skills.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nOkay, I can buy that &quot;seeking answers leads to critical thinking skills&quot;,  <br/>\nbut honestly, I haven&#39;t found anything yet, in our unschooling lives, that  <br/>\n*hasn&#39;t* lead to critical thinking skills or just plain old &quot;thinking skills&quot;.  <br/>\nToo many negatives there... maybe like this: So far, everything in our  <br/>\nunschooling lives has lead to critical thinking skills or just plain old  &quot;thinking <br/>\nskills&quot;. My providing answers for my son or looking things up together  has not <br/>\nstunted his ability to question or evaluate anything he hears that  doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&quot;jive&quot; with him. Really, like those rare times with my dad, it tends to  lead to <br/>\ndeeper conversations, more connections... more learning and more  trust.... <br/>\nand better relationships.<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**************Gas prices getting you down?
