Is there a way to search using keywords?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is how one might handle a situation between two friends who, more often than not, rub each other the wrong way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 5. My closest friend in town has a son who is 5, also. Our sons have really different personalities and approaches to conflict. After about twenty minutes, the fun they were have together turns to something else entirely, and my boy usually shuts down and her boy usually wants us to leave (or wants us to leave). He has the same kind of problems with his cousin who is 6, though they&#39;re happy together for a couple of hours before the conflicts arise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have observed plenty of times when my son really &quot;clicked&quot; with another child, when they could play hours and hours together happily, each feeding off of the other&#39;s energy, not only getting along, but really enjoying each other&#39;s contributions to the play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it&#39;s not like that with the son of my closest friend or the cousin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you do? Do you approach the playtime knowing that it might only be 20 minutes, and that&#39;s fine? If so, how do you help the kids to &quot;call it quits&quot; without having it seem like not being able to work through the conflict was a social failure and they&#39;re being punished? (It&#39;s not always the case that both kids are ready for the break, or that they can really articulate that a break is what they want.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Have lots of distracting toys/games/activities for when things get rough (this one I&#39;ve tried, but it feels like I&#39;m putting on a song and dance to postpone the inevitable, and I wonder if that&#39;s really useful)? <br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid playing together at all, until they&#39;re in a different developmental place, more able to work with each other&#39;s differences? (Not my favorite option, and not always possible, but I can see how this might give everybody a little ease for a while.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know. Part of me really, really *gets* it--not everybody gets along. I know that, especially with the cousin (family), that most often being friends is a mixed bag, and that if he really, really didn&#39;t want to hang out with certain kids at all, he&#39;d tell me. I&#39;m looking at the signpost--is my child happy--and I can say with honesty that for X number of minutes, yes, yes he is. But I&#39;m wondering how to maximize the good in a relationship that tends toward conflict while helping him to establish his own boundaries with kindness and respect the boundaries of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what are your thoughts on this?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeresa<br/>\nMama to Woody (5) and Fox (2)</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61063,"nextTopicId":61062}}
