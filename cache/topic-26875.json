We don&#39;t  <br/>\nbadmouth anybody who does - lots of our family members and close  <br/>\nfriends drink occasionally and that&#39;s fine with us - but we choose to  <br/>\nnot have it in our lives at all. Our reason is that we feel that our  <br/>\npurpose in life is to be MORE aware, more conscious, more mindful -  <br/>\nand alcohol has a known negative impact on the brain -  even in low  <br/>\namounts it causes a reduced ability to concentrate, reduced  <br/>\ncoordination, slower reflexes, poorer reaction time. We just don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant to do that to ourselves - not on purpose, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two daughters in college who go to lots of parties - they pick  <br/>\nand choose which parties to go to based on how much alcohol they  <br/>\nthink will be involved. ALL parties have alcohol - but some parties  <br/>\nseem to be just for the purpose of everybody getting drunk, while  <br/>\nother parties will have much less drinking and at least a small group  <br/>\nof nondrinkers. My daughters find the &quot;everybody is getting drunk&quot;  <br/>\nparties to be very distressing - they don&#39;t like seeing the people  <br/>\nthey know acting like idiots, doing stupid things, talking with  <br/>\nslurred speech, being boorish and obnoxious. So, if they think the  <br/>\ndrinking is getting people to that point, they leave. Roxana left  <br/>\nearly from a party just this last Saturday night - she stayed until  <br/>\nabout 11 and then the drinking had gotten started in earnest and she  <br/>\nwasn&#39;t having fun anymore. My kids will not get in the car with a  <br/>\ndriver who had been drinking - not even after one drink (which is  <br/>\nenough to impair driving ability - and this includes just one beer or  <br/>\none glass of wine). So - I&#39;m always on call - and have often picked  <br/>\nthem up from parties and even picked up their friends who had been  <br/>\ndrinking and needed rides home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI always assumed my kids would try drinking and try smoking pot - and  <br/>\nRoya has tried them. She drank a couple of big cups full of some kind  <br/>\nof whiskey, got sick and threw up. She was VERY embarrassed and that  <br/>\nwas enough for her. She didn&#39;t like marijuana because she didn&#39;t like  <br/>\nfeeling out of control. Roxana has tasted some alcohol, but not drunk  <br/>\nenough to feel the effects. She may still try it - but she won&#39;t ever  <br/>\ndo it on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a few years we hung out with a group of homeschoolers with  <br/>\nparents who engaged in lots of social drinking, not sure if they were  <br/>\ndrinking otherwise. Recently my daughters went to a &quot;reunion&quot; of a  <br/>\nbunch of the now-young adults who used to be part of that group - and  <br/>\nmy girls were suprized to discover that these kids were all into  <br/>\ndrinking as &quot;what you do&quot; at a party.

But that&#39;s  <br/>\nokay with me - I have plenty of friends and a happy and joyful life  <br/>\nwithout alcohol. And it has NOT, in fact, turned my kids into idiots  <br/>\nwho would act like the person described in the paragraph I quoted  <br/>\nabove. For parents who do drink, I think there is an issue of  <br/>\nrestricting kids from something that the adults in their families are  <br/>\ndoing. If my kids wanted to drink alcohol, they&#39;d say so and they  <br/>\ncould do it - we would support that interest. But they&#39;re not in an  <br/>\nenvironment where alcohol looks enticing to them - they don&#39;t see  <br/>\ntheir parents drinking and having fun with it, while they&#39;re deprived  <br/>\nand told they have to wait. And they&#39;ve seen how drinking adults get  <br/>\noverly loud and kind of obnoxious in various ways - so they don&#39;t  <br/>\nwant that for themselves. They know why people drink - that it is fun  <br/>\nand loosens up inhibitions and so on. But they&#39;re also pretty clear  <br/>\nthat it doesn&#39;t seem worth it, to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling shirts, cups, bumper stickers, bags...<br/>\nLive Love Learn<br/>\nUNSCHOOL!<br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn\">http://www.cafepress.com/livelovelearn</a>&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Perspective on Kids and Alcohol","postDate":"1156787902","msgId":26888,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhDODk4RTJBRkY1QjNBQi0xMkMtRDlCQG1ibGstZDEwLnN5c29wcy5hb2wuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzkxMEVCLTQ1N0UtNEE2OS05NTQ0LTNBOUUzNjMwODNBQkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGVjdTRncys4cjdlQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTMzOTEwRUItNDU3RS00QTY5LTk1NDQtM0E5RTM2MzA4M0FCQHNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":26887,"nextInTopic":26889,"prevInTime":26887,"nextInTime":26889,"topicId":26875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

In my late teens and early 20&#39;s I drank a lot, and it did get in the way of my living a healthy life. It did lower my inhibitions in dangerous ways.  And for about 15 yrs I didn&#39;t drink at all -- stopped cold turkey on New year&#39;s 88 (after two years of occasional drinking).  I only started social drinking again in &#39;02.  Now, I usually have a bottle of wine in the fridge and will have a glass or two a week.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I enjoy it because it does help me relax.  I tend to carry all the stress in my muscles and it becomes a cycle of stress causing pain, pain causing more stress.  Often a glass of wine will relax me just enough to take the edge off the intensity.  It lets me stop the obsession that&#39;s always part of stress for me.  It lets me let go of the need to control things I really can&#39;t fix or solve, which is a good thing, so sometimes giving up a bit of control is a good thing.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  As to how to deal with it with kids, I think that sometimes it varies from kid to kid.  My oldest son gets high more often than I&#39;d like, but his life at 21 is so much less a mess than mine was at that age, that I&#39;m just relieved.  My worries for him are that he comes from addiction issues on all 4 sides of his family, so I know his risk is greater. One comfort to me is that his solution to the topic of driving high or drunk is that he doesn&#39;t own a car, or have a license, tho he did in the past.  This way, he&#39;s removed for himself the temptation to drive high.  If he gets an urge to go out while high, he has no choice but to walk.  Gotta say, that&#39;s more responsible than most folks I knew at 21. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  My brother is a life-long alcoholic -- started drinking at 8yo -- he&#39;ll never change.  He drives drunk, screws up his life (and his kids&#39; lives too) but that doesn&#39;t have to be my kids&#39; fate, just because they share some genetic material.  It&#39;s hard to watch, even harder to feel powerless to help him or his kids, but it&#39;s his choice.  It is a choice, because even tho alcholism is a disease, one choses to drink.  I also know the pain that led my brother to start drinking, so I can understand how he got there.  It&#39;s something I&#39;m committed to avoid for my kids - the pain. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I do think the genetic risk is a valid concern, but I don&#39;t think anyone becomes an addict/alcoholic without some real dysfunction in his/her life.  Addiction and alcholism are forms of self-medication, efforts to treat pain in a person&#39;s life.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Dh doesn&#39;t drink at all, because he&#39;s allergic to liquor (along with a host of other things, I think it&#39;s really about mold).  Andy has asked to have a drink of wine, but at one sniff he has no desire to drink at all -- not a surprise knowing Andy. Dan loves wine, but only sweet wine, and has no interest in beer. He enjoys sweet drinks -- coolers and the like.  I share with him when he asks, but keep it to a sip or two because he&#39;s little.  <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think it&#39;s a mistake to restrict alcohol under age 21 across the board. If my kid are going to get drunk and/or do something stupid, I&#39;d much rather it be while they&#39;re young enough that I can help them with the legal end of things.  Once a person is 21, s/he&#39;s on their own legally and the stakes are getting higher all the time. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  I think the single best thing dh and I can do to prevent drinking/drug problems for our kids is  to give them as joyous a life as we can, filled with love and beauty.  Kids who know they are loved and can always turn to us when life hurts, are less likely to need to self-medicate.<br/>\n   <br/>\n  Sylvia<br/>\n<br/>\n \t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\n All-new Yahoo!

And while a pub cannot serve your child alcohol, you, the parent, can order a drink for them after they are a certain age (the thought at the minute with David and his brother in the house is that its 12 or 14).  In the U.S., I&#39;m certain, you can serve alcohol to your children when they are underage. And trying to find the laws on-line I found this article:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jointogether.org/news/research/summaries/2006/teaching-responsible-drinking.html\">http://www.jointogether.org/news/research/summaries/2006/teaching-responsible-drinking.html</a> which has this end paragraph:<br/>\n <br/>\n--College student Jen Sherwin, a child of California winemakers, said she found that kids at school who had grown up in the most restrictive environments tended to get into the most trouble with alcohol. &quot;It was absolutely insane. There was a lot of alcohol poisoning, a lot of kids had to get their stomachs pumped. People would drink 24/7,&quot; she said. &quot;I had other friends up there from Napa Valley who didn&#39;t go overboard either, because we are used to being around wine, and the freedom of being able to drink wasn&#39;t overwhelming to us.&quot;--<br/>\n <br/>\nWhile alcoholism is something to be wary of, it seems that choice still has an important role to play in drinking.<br/>\n <br/>\nFrom a personal perspective, both Simon and Linnaea have had wine and mead and beer and hardish cider in sips usually. Simon likes cider that isn&#39;t very alcoholic (I think 2%) and Linnaea used to like really hoppy beer, but she doesn&#39;t anymore. They like to pretend to be drunk for a laugh. Last night Linnaea and Simon and their cousins were dancing and air guitaring to Black Sabbath and Linnaea was a backup singer who drank alot and turned into a zombie drunk by the third song (Iron Man). There is no history of alcoholism on either David&#39;s or my side of the family, but my family has a fairly Methodist relationship with drink, as little as possible to keep the Lord loving us. Both David and I drink most evenings. He&#39;ll have a beer or a glass of wine and I usually have a glass of wine while I cook, or watch David cooking. We&#39;ve discovered that Norfolk has a tradition of micro-breweries (and have discovered that the Waynforths of olde were brewers in the region) so David will<br/>\n probably start doing a little beer making soon since the supplies are readily available. It is not among the things that keeps me up nights. I am fairly confident that they have no tendency towards alcoholism and that they won&#39;t feel alcohol is something more than a nice accompaniment to dinner.<br/>\n <br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\nFrom: Jennifer Long <br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> <br/>\nSent: Monday, August 28, 2006 3:01 AM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Perspective on Kids and Alcohol<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think you were wrong at all for telling your son that he needs to wait til he&#39;s 21.

I grew up in a home <br/>\nwithout any alcohol (not even beer)as my father was a recovering <br/>\nalcoholic. A couple of my brothers are alcoholic (one can go months <br/>\nor years without slipping, the other is a drink-every-day-until-you-<br/>\ndie alcoholic.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i did was share my experiences with alcohol with my son, <br/>\nopenly. My sister also did that, just told him stories, mostly about <br/>\ntimes of getting too drunk and making bad choices. I make sure he <br/>\nknows that drinking in moderation is ok, drinking then driving never <br/>\nok, and that since he has genes that are more prone to alcoholism <br/>\n(one grandparent out of four, neither parents, not too bad but ya <br/>\nnever know)he needs to be careful. My son is very into experiences, <br/>\nin learning everything he can about life, and sometimes he thinks he <br/>\nis more grown up than he is. So i think alcohol is something he <br/>\nthinks he can handle. I&#39;m uncomfortable letting him drink the <br/>\nalcohol we have in the house (most of it is sweet stuff, like arbor <br/>\nmist or mike&#39;s hard lemonade)although i did let him try a sip of the <br/>\nremnants of my margarita after the ice had melted in the bottom. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he went to his dad&#39;s he had some guinness, i wasnt too happy <br/>\nabout his father making a decision to give him alcohol without <br/>\nconsulting me, and although i don&#39;t think he truly liked the taste <br/>\nhe said he did. I really think he does equate drinking with a grown <br/>\nup thing to do, which i guess it is given the restrictions in our <br/>\nculture. If we were a family that regularly drank wine with dinner <br/>\nor something, i think i would let him try it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly i try to give him factual info about how alcohol lowers <br/>\ninhibitions, which can sometimes be a good thing, and is often not <br/>\nsuch a good thing. That it makes you less in control of yourself if <br/>\nyou drink enough of it, that different types of alcohol have <br/>\ndifferent effects (wine vs liquor for example)and that how much you <br/>\nweigh, or how well you tolerate it can effect how much you can drink <br/>\nbefore getting drunk. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe went through a period where we were talking about drugs and <br/>\nalcohol alot, he was very curious. He hasnt brought it up in quite <br/>\nawhile, but he knows that the lines of communication are open. If i <br/>\nfound out he was drinking as a teenager, i wouldnt freak out or <br/>\nanything, and he knows that. My big thing would be to call if you <br/>\nneed a ride, *thats* the one main thing i would stress. Seems to me <br/>\nthat the kids who aren&#39;t afraid of their parents flipping out are <br/>\nthe ones more likely to call for a ride, which is the most important <br/>\nthing i think. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Perspective on Kids and Alcohol","postDate":"1156738248","msgId":26877,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHS0VLS0RQQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDYwODI4MDIwMTIzLjk5ODAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU1OTE0Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26876,"nextInTopic":26880,"prevInTime":26876,"nextInTime":26878,"topicId":26875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hey Sunday!

Not all at once, but over time when it fits.

Even if there<br/>\nis such a thing with your guy, the best thing he could get is information<br/>\nwithin a rich unschooling life. I imagine the incidence of addiction is<br/>\nmuch, much lower for people who had free and respected childhoods with<br/>\nhealthy family relationships.

They usually didn&#39;t like the taste and didn&#39;t<br/>\nseek it out again. Now as teenagers, they may be a little more interested,<br/>\nbut they don&#39;t seem to have an interest in &quot;getting drunk&quot;, though they&#39;ve<br/>\nseen it many times on tv or movies, and have been in a couple of different<br/>\nsituations where other kids were drinking. Of course seeing someone wasted<br/>\nis pretty good incentive to NOT want to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":273016258,"authorName":"Jennifer Long","from":"Jennifer Long &lt;jenjen71379@...&gt;","profile":"jenjen71379","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Perspective on Kids and Alcohol","postDate":"1156730483","msgId":26876,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwODI4MDIwMTIzLjk5ODAzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjU1OTE0Lm1haWwucmUzLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEYwQUNEOERBLUQzMTgtNERDQS04NkE4LTk5RkJDMTgyNjJDNUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26875,"nextInTopic":26877,"prevInTime":26875,"nextInTime":26877,"topicId":26875,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I dont think you were wrong at all for telling your son that he needs to wait til he s 21.

He accepts that it&#39;s an &quot;adult&quot; drink and doesn&#39;t really want to<br/>\ndrink it now. But he has said a couple of times that when he grows up<br/>\nhe will be able to drink beer.
