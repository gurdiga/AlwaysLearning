It&#39;s not really acceptable or <br/>\ncommon to be blatantly racist (or homophobic or whatever) these days, but we <br/>\nhave this stuff institutionalized. It makes a difference if we&#39;re aware, <br/>\nnotice our discomforts, and make a point to &quot;walk our talk.&quot; You KNOW you <br/>\nhave some racist hangups and wish you didn&#39;t? Wow, that&#39;s WONDERFUL!  You&#39;re <br/>\nmost of the way there already!<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned an interesting parenting thing from a good friend of mine about the <br/>\nassumptions we make.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a straight married woman who was talking about her kids. She <br/>\nmentioned she was gently teasing her then 15 year old daughter about a couple <br/>\nof kids she had met over a weekend, a boy and a girl. She asked about the <br/>\nboy, &quot;So do you LIKE him?&quot; THEN she asked if she LIKED the girl. <br/>\n<br/>\nI was flabbergasted! ( I just love that word). She had an awareness that her <br/>\ndaughter just might not be straight, and without even really trying, <br/>\ncommunicated to her that it was okay and natural, in the light teasing way <br/>\nthat parents do with their kids sometimes. (This kid is one who was fine with <br/>\nher mom asking about this kind of thing.) Now, most of our kids are likely to <br/>\nbe straight. BUT even very enlightened parents often talk to their kids in <br/>\nways that would make it hard for a questioning kid to think it was okay. <br/>\nKathleen gracefully, in a normal situation, did that (and does consistently.) <br/>\n Until she told me that story (and, even more amazingly, it was not to show <br/>\nme how enlightenened she was. She was genuinely startled when I complimented <br/>\nher on that aspect of it.), it hadn&#39;t occurred to me how much &gt;I&lt; took for <br/>\ngranted that Julian would probably be straight. I think about the messages I <br/>\ngive much more now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this as clear as mud? I&#39;m still a little addled.<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11011,"nextTopicId":11012}}
