I&#39;ve tried different choices of words, and physically  <br/>\ninterfering. Words get ignored and stopping the play myself (hug, stepping in,  <br/>\njoining in and redirecting) bring major protests that are too constant and loud  <br/>\nfor anyone to hear anything I have to say. My boys are very rough and tumble, <br/>\n high energy and I&#39;m fine with most physical play, but there&#39;s sometimes when <br/>\n they get so energized and in-the-moment that I *do* get concerned. They are <br/>\n5  1/2 years apart and Wyl is *very* good most of the time about checking his  <br/>\npower, but sometimes he forgets. Storm (3) gets caught up in the &quot;free for <br/>\nall&quot;  attitude and jumps full weight (40+ pounds) onto belly, back, legs with <br/>\nhis full  weight on his knees-if Wyl isn&#39;t complaining about that, I bite my <br/>\ntongue, but  there are times when Wyl wants it to stop. I&#39;ve tried, &quot;Ow means <br/>\nstop&quot; (and  similar) reminders, but they mostly get ignored. We&#39;re able to work <br/>\nthrough to  win-win in other situations fairly easily and smoothly, such as: <br/>\nconcern over  how an important toy is being used/hurt, private time, both <br/>\nwanting the same  thing, etc., but for some reason, it just doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>\ntranslate in the  physical play. Then my lack of &quot;being heard&quot; gets stirred in with my <br/>\nconcerns  for safety/health and then old tapes start running through my head <br/>\nand sometimes  it gets to the point where I feel like its several &quot;either-or&quot; <br/>\nchoices-none of  which are win-win... <br/>\n <br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Another thing Joyce mentioned was that strong people need to  learn to <br/>\ncontrol their power.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\nControl it as in stopping it or control it as in redirecting?<br/>\n <br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nDe<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s new at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":76178688,"authorName":"jenbgosh","from":"&quot;jenbgosh&quot; &lt;pcjen@...&gt;","profile":"jenbgosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]Powerlessness-was: a different gun question","postDate":"1194621328","msgId":31368,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZoMXRpZytnbGRiQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDVBMkI3ODZGLTlBNDYtNDBEMC04QTdGLUZCNDQxNjBFNTlFM0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":31364,"nextInTopic":31370,"prevInTime":31367,"nextInTime":31369,"topicId":31362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

You might become powerfully  <br/>\ngood at unschooling. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nYou have the power to screw your kids up (we all do).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing Joyce mentioned was that strong people need to learn to  <br/>\ncontrol their power.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning]Powerlessness-was: a different gun question","postDate":"1194591774","msgId":31362,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJjMS4xZTYzMzQxNC4zNDY1NjAxZUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31364,"prevInTime":31361,"nextInTime":31363,"topicId":31362,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/2/2007 6:08:12 PM Eastern Standard Time, jfetteroll@verizon.net writes: I  think the biggest problem is that people see children as","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2054880327\">In a message dated 11/2/2007 6:08:12 PM Eastern Standard Time,  <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jfetteroll@...\">jfetteroll@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\nI  think the biggest problem is that people see children as broken and <br/>\nevil.
