Actually, at this point she still does appreciated it.<br/>\nIt&#39;s sure been interesting exchanging roles with her.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI talked yesterday with a woman who runs an adult family home.  I was<br/>\nintrigued when she asked if my mother had been a good mama to me.  She had<br/>\nlots of neat things to say about how she relates to older people.  I don&#39;t<br/>\nknow if we&#39;ll choose that one though.  She started dropping little hints<br/>\nthat she&#39;s a heavy duty Christian.  I&#39;m actually hoping that she did it<br/>\nbecause she thought somehow that I was.  If that&#39;s the case, she might be<br/>\nable to refrain from preaching or doing the Christian dance around my<br/>\nmother, a lifelong atheist.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t move her in there.<br/>\nTia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109856460,"authorName":"nellebelle","from":"&quot;nellebelle&quot; &lt;nellebelle@...&gt;","profile":"lamaribelle","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"dementia, was Re: [AlwaysLearning] This List","postDate":"1046190098","msgId":12536,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNjgwMWMyZGNlYSQ2ZmE1ZjNjMCQ2NTAxYThjMEBvZW1jb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDE5MC4xNjI5YTI0OS4yYjhjMTEwZkBhb2wuY29tPiA8MDM5MTAxYzJkYzgwJGMzNmUzNzIwJDA5MDBhOGMwQHdlc3Q+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":12538,"prevInTime":12535,"nextInTime":12537,"topicId":12536,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Tia, This must be so hard for you.
