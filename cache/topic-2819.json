Welcome Tara!<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This morning I wanted to take Isaiah (4 d.s.) to the planetarium. He<br/>\n&gt; kept telling me he wanted to go to the Children&#39;s Museum. I said we&#39;ll<br/>\n&gt; go to the planetarium today and the Children&#39;s Museum tomorrow, which he<br/>\n&gt; was still not too happy about. My brother-in-law called and asked if he<br/>\n&gt; wanted to go hiking. I said sure. Isaiah started saying, rather loudly,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t want to go hiking. I want to go to the Children&#39;s Museum.&quot; I<br/>\n&gt; promptly told BIL I&#39;d call him back. I told Isaiah we&#39;d go to the<br/>\n&gt; planetarium and then hiking and TOMORROW we&#39;d go to the Children&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; Museum. (The reason I&#39;m so insistent on going today is that they have a<br/>\n&gt; program geared just toward his age group today.) He looked at me and<br/>\n&gt; said, &quot;Mom, you are not respecting my wishes. I want to go to the<br/>\n&gt; Children&#39;s Museum.&quot; I was getting a bit upset, so I gave myself a quiet<br/>\n&gt; time-out in the bathroom. I was looking in the mirror when I thought,<br/>\n&gt; &quot;He&#39;s right. I&#39;m not respecting his wishes. I&#39;m pushing this planetarium<br/>\n&gt; thing on him, because I want him to see it, when all he really wants is<br/>\n&gt; to go to the Children&#39;s Museum. If I take him to the museum today,<br/>\n&gt; there&#39;s many other Saturdays I can take him to the planetarium. It&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; much more important to tell him and show him that I *do* respect his<br/>\n&gt; wishes than to expose him to the planetarium.&quot; So, I came out of the<br/>\n&gt; bathroom and told him that he was right, I wasn&#39;t respecting him. He<br/>\n&gt; looked me square in the eyes, smiled and said, &quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>He really is incredible. His eyes are so deep and thoughtful, it really<br/>\nis hard to believe he is only four. I like your idea of a time out to<br/>\nthink things through rather than reacting impulsively.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think the best thing I&#39;ve taught Isaiah is to speak his truth.<br/>\n&gt; Sometimes that can seem disrespectful. That&#39;s only because I was taught<br/>\n&gt; to mind my elders and not talk back. I&#39;ve also spent 30 years not living<br/>\n&gt; for myself, but doing what everyone else wanted. I don&#39;t want that for<br/>\n&gt; Isaiah.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Absolutely. And there is a time for learning and coming to terms with<br/>\nthe inner self and a time for working through and learning how to think<br/>\nabout what others are feeling and thinking. I think a too early emphasis<br/>\nfor toddlers and preschoolers on the outer view can be very harmful.<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sometimes it takes a time-out to make you come to your senses. I&#39;d<br/>\n&gt; rather take one than hurt his feelings.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; After all, he&#39;s just like a tiny shoot coming out of the ground in<br/>\n&gt; Spring, aiming his tiny leaves at the sun.
