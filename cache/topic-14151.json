Beside the cost, What is the down side to a modern<br/>\ndental X-ray? <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it is like anything, you weigh the costs and the benefits. Life is a<br/>\nrisky endeavor and it seems to me, the dentist helps make it a more<br/>\ncomfortable, enjoyable journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I understand,<br/>\nBenefits:<br/>\nDental X-rays are an important diagnostic tool for assessing your (or your<br/>\nchild&#39;s) oral health. They give your dentist detailed information about<br/>\npossible gum, bone and tooth diseases, as well as seeing those hidden<br/>\ncavities between the teeth. This seems like a wealth of information for a<br/>\nsmall amount of radiation. And I mean small.<br/>\n<br/>\nRadiation:<br/>\nA full set of dental X-rays, from 12 to 18 images from any machine made<br/>\nafter about 1966, (doses could have been massively higher before this time)<br/>\ngives a radiation dose equal to environmental exposure of about a typical<br/>\nday outdoors. These are the full set used for baseline comparisons,<br/>\ntypically given every 3-5 years. The four bitewing images that are<br/>\nrecommended every year or two are a fraction of that. The statistics say<br/>\nthat a set of bitewings will trigger a cancer or other abnormality every one<br/>\nto ten million. You can&#39;t beat these odds getting up from your computer<br/>\nchair.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear of concerns about Hypothyroidism. These claims seem to stem from<br/>\nradiation doses magnitudes higher than the present day machines. I can&#39;t<br/>\nfind any solid evidence or tested studies of these claims.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this supercedes finding a dentist (or any healthcare professional)<br/>\nthat you can talk to openly and honestly who will listen to your concerns<br/>\nand develop a long term relationship with. If you can&#39;t talk honestly to<br/>\nsomeone who will listen, keep looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seen pictures of my ancestors and their teeth. It would be very<br/>\ndifficult to convince me that regular check ups and cleanings are not a<br/>\nbeneficial thing, helping me reach an enjoyable and comfortable old age.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Dan Vilter</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":39764976,"authorName":"Alan & Brenda Leonard","from":"Alan & Brenda Leonard &lt;abtleo@...&gt;","profile":"abtleo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Dental X-rays","postDate":"1052249784","msgId":14151,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBREREQjMxLjI1MUYlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNTIyMTgzODMuNTA4Ljc1MjAzLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":14163,"prevInTime":14150,"nextInTime":14152,"topicId":14151,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
