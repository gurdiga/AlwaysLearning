That&#39;s very tacky, but part of the brag too is that she uses an e-mail on this list that will never be discovered.  So that&#39;s the hobby of someone who should definitely pay more attention to her children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAncient &quot;netiquette&quot; says if people want to disagree, they should take it off to e-mail.  I think that&#39;s horrible advice.  (Much of early &quot;netiquette&quot; was fairly tacky and rude.)    I see this as a meeting.  People come to a meeting and ask questions and there is cross talk, and the moderators and organizers get to ask someone to sit down and be quieter.  Typical meeting tradition (older than the net).<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing in meeting tradition makes it okay for someone to follow someone else home and accost them on the porch.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for me personally, I don&#39;t like side e-mail at all, and have said so, but it&#39;s not &quot;a group policy.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone wants to report unwanted side mail to me or another moderator, please do that.  Moderators can throw people off the list for being troublesome.  If it&#39;s something you don&#39;t want a particular moderator to see, send it to one of the other ones.  Active moderators are Deb Lewis, Joyce Fetteroll, &quot;wtexans,&quot; Jill Parmer and me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if you want to just out the person right here, right now, that&#39;s fine too.  People aren&#39;t allowed to be rude on the side and expect people to protect them.  If someone follows me home when I don&#39;t want them to, I&#39;m not going to let THEM decide whether I can call the police about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we&#39;re taking a procedural/philosophical break, if there&#39;s anyone here who thinks this is unreasonable or doesn&#39;t really care about radical unschooling, please do leave the list.
