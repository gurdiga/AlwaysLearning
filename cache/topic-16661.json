I am having that <br/>\nsame <br/>\nexperience with Moly right now. Example, she was painting and came and asked <br/>\nabout a brush I have that she has never used. She wanted to know if she could <br/>\nuse it and how to use it. I explained it similar to another she has used and <br/>\nstarted to show her how to hold it to get the desired effect. Then came the <br/>\n&quot;I <br/>\nkNOw Mom.&quot; Complete with rolled eyes and a huff as she walked off.<br/>\nWhat has worked for us is conversations about how it hurts our feelings when <br/>\nJ isn&#39;t nice to us. We try to be nice to him as much as possible, and it <br/>\nmatters that he treat us well too. We can always follow up in the heat of the <br/>\nmoment with just a quiet &quot;I would really like you to speak to me in a kinder way.&quot; <br/>\nA lot of the time he isn&#39;t even aware of it, and it&#39;s generally followed by a <br/>\nvery quick apology.  You do get to be treated kindly, too. If she NEEDS to say <br/>\n&quot;I KNOW!&quot; and not listen to your suggestion, then at least you don&#39;t get <br/>\ndumped on. (And being kind to you includes not blaming you if the projects don&#39;t <br/>\nwork out.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far her ignoring your suggestions -- Well...I guess that&#39;s those logical <br/>\nconsequences we&#39;ve all heard so much about!<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose if she keeps blaming you, you could have her sign a contract that <br/>\nacknowledges that she KNOWS, and that results, positive and negative are her <br/>\nown responsibility. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I would mostly stress that she has to be nice to you.
