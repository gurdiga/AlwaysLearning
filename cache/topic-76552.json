There are four or five not as great as the rest, and then some that are so sparkly you’ll rise up as if by magic from the uplift! :-)  I’m almost serious.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who have heard all of Amy’s podcasts, which are your favorites?  If you can respond with a link straight to that favorite (or several) that would be really great.<br/>\nOr if you have a favorite of my pages or Joyce’s or Pam Sorooshian’s or Pam Laricchia’s with introductory ideas for new unschoolers, please link those, if you have one, if you’re in the mood to share.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"New members","postDate":"1453228924","msgId":76552,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEY3MkQ0RkU3LTBGNzctNDQ2NC1CMjJFLUM3Njg4QzA4NkVDOEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":76553,"prevInTime":76551,"nextInTime":76553,"topicId":76552,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Resources!

What kind of parents and parenting<br/>\ndoes it take? What will help, and what will hinder?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling<br/>\nand attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based<br/>\non the principles underlying unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways Learning will focus on how people learn no matter<br/>\nwhere in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any<br/>\nparticular country or jurisdiction.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way. New members&#39; posts are moderated, and it&#39;s good to read several dozen posts before jumping in.) <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;ve never read any John Holt, his thoughts and writing are behind unschooling. There is a link on that page, too. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I can honestly say that I&#39;ve grown more as a person, parent and unschooler due to the discussions on this list than on any other list I&#39;ve been on.” <br/>\n________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning\">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you’re considering unschooling ideas from a very basic point of view, these two pages will help.<br/>\nLook into, look at, the information iinked from Pam Laricchia and Amy Childs, there, too.
