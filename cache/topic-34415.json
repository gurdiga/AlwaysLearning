The goal is harmony though, and I think the kids get a whole lot<br/>\nmore by seeing me being gracious with my mother than seeing me respond<br/>\nspitefully to her. And mostly, she&#39;s pretty cool. But there are times when<br/>\ngiving guidelines, information, a nudge, light-hearted responses, etc. have<br/>\nbeen useful. And we have lots of conversations processing stuff about her<br/>\nand her views when we are alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacki<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n[mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>]On Behalf Of blue_mountain34<br/>\nSent: Sunday, April 20, 2008 11:08 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] hair colour comments<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi All<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned SO much from this list in the past year or so that I&#39;ve<br/>\nbeen reading it....I&#39;ve appreciated being able to do so quietly, in<br/>\nthe background... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nToday, dh&#39;s parents came to supper.

I think<br/>\nyour daughter&#39;s thank you was beautiful and wise: She focused on the<br/>\npositive (however superficial) part of Grandma&#39;s comment and chose to ignore<br/>\nthe underlying negative. Making any statement on how you liked the teal<br/>\nwould have been focusing on the negative part of her comment, in my opinion,<br/>\nand that again, would serve no one. Following your daughter&#39;s lead in the<br/>\nway she handled this particular scenario seems like the best policy to me!<br/>\nIsn&#39;t it wonderful when it works that way?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if Grandma had said something more overtly negative or<br/>\nhurtful, and particularly if DD seemed to be taken aback by it, that&#39;s when<br/>\nI would step in in her defense. For instance if she still had the teal<br/>\nhighlights and Grandma had said &quot;I liked your other color more than this<br/>\ngreen&quot; I might step in with a smile and said &quot;*I* like the TEAL, but more to<br/>\nthe point, (insert DD&#39;s name) does or she wouldn&#39;t have chosen it!&quot; or<br/>\nsomething like that. I find that stating the obvious in a cheerful way<br/>\nsometimes has a way of reminding people of what should have been obvious to<br/>\nthem in the first place, but wasn&#39;t, for some reason! Then again, DD might<br/>\nalso be thinking that Grandma is entitled to her own opinion, even if it&#39;s<br/>\none different from her own?
