With straight democracy (one person one vote), <br/>\nsome JUNK can be voted through.  With consensus, only good ideas are even heard, and a great idea just jumps up and moves people.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve had this experience as well, and I don&#39;t disagree. However, in my personal life I&#39;ve begun to wonder if this doesn&#39;t add up to eletism in some ways. I know that sometimes newcomers come along who are great, naturals at the subject at hand. Sometimes they leave again, feeling unheard, or brushed off, or feeling that their is little hope of making it to &quot;in crowd&quot; status and having a substantial say in things.<br/>\n <br/>\nWhat do you think? In most ways I agree with your premise, but in some small way I wonder if maybe, for example, the list should just say &quot;Life According to Jane Doe&quot; if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going to be.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope I&#39;m making myself clear, as I mentioned it&#39;s something I&#39;m struggling with in my life. For me, it&#39;s been a difficult line between being a mentor and sharing my experience as opposed to &quot;teaching&quot;, which I don&#39;t think is particularly helpful to other families. <br/>\n <br/>\nAriella<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nvote.yahoo.com - Register online to vote today!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21033,"nextTopicId":21130}}
