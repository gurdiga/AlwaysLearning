The website sends the parent progress reports that the kids never have to see.  This, in addition to my blog, was all my reviewer really needed.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nMy son just started the 2nd grade Virtual Jump Start and can&#39;t get enough.  It is similar to Wizards 101, but not as cool:).  The games kind of serve the purpose of a skills test, but besides being bombarded with &quot;Good Jobs&quot;, there are no scores or grades.\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI just wanted to put this out there because I know some people have to be evaluated at the end of the year and this is a stress free and fun thing to add to a portfolio.  It is great for us because my son does very little writing and all of his math is mental math, so I don&#39;t have a lot to show in the areas of math and reading (besides our reading list).\r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nI hope this helps someone who might be struggling the idea of a portfolio review.  Of course states have different laws and people need to know what is required for their state.  \r<br/>\n\r<br/>\nSteph\r<br/>\nSent from my BlackBerryÂ® smartphone with Nextel Direct Connect</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":51868,"nextTopicId":52018}}
