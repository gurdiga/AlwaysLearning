I think once you get <br/>\nunschooling it&#39;s easy to get unfooding and the other unparenting <br/>\nthings, but it still takes awhile to get totally comfortable with <br/>\nit.  Unfooding doesn&#39;t sound like quite the right word for it, does <br/>\nit?  Unfooders still eat food! lol Just like you wouldn&#39;t call an <br/>\nunschooler and unlearner.  But anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome days I&#39;ve been impressed and some days I&#39;m not.  Like today, my <br/>\nthree year old had nilla wafers for breakfast, meatballs in spaghetti <br/>\nsauce and 1/2 a hot dog for lunch, and a grilled cheese sandwich with <br/>\ntomato and onion for supper.  He still drinks nothing but soda.  My <br/>\nfive year old had nilla wafers for breakfast and didn&#39;t eat lunch.  <br/>\nHe ate a toasted cheese (just cheese and bread) for supper and at <br/>\nnight had a snack of leftover hamburg and potatos.  He drank sunny <br/>\ndelight all day.  I&#39;m not sure what my 9 year old ate for breakfast <br/>\nand lunch, but she had a toasted cheese for supper and hamburg and <br/>\npotatos for a bedtime snack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m learning to relax, which is good.  The biggest area that needs <br/>\nimprovement is my modelling of good food choices.  I struggle with <br/>\neating well.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":8634,"nextTopicId":8656}}
