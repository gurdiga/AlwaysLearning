The freedom to be true to who they are, all the time, at peace with themselves, happy, loved and nurtured.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Free to discover everything and anything that interests them - everyday.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Limitless and independent in their thinking. Making their own decisions in exploration of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Family time is limitless, not constricted to 4 hours in the evening competing with unnecessary homework, reading and bathtime.   The kids play with one another, feel closer to one another.  This week alone my kids ( dd 7, ds 10) have laughed so hard they peed in their pants at least 4 times!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\n5. They are each so happy to be home with mom.  I have heard this many times from each of them and have been the recipient of hugs and even an unrequested  kiss on the cheek from ds!! WOW<br/>\n<br/>\nSince reading some of John Taylor Gatto, they are NEVER going back!!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCarole in CT - Mom to Lauren (13) Jonah (10) and Julia (7)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-----  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n____________________________________________________________________________________<br/>\nThe fish are biting. <br/>\nGet more visitors on your site using Yahoo!
