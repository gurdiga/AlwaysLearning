It&#39;s for a school project (yuck), but <br/>\nI thought some people might like to respond anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Mary<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Hello,<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We are in Mrs. Lentz&#39;s Computer Class at Clara Bolen Elementary in Tawas <br/>\n&gt;City, MI.  We are doing an experiment for the art and science fair to be <br/>\n&gt;held in April at our school.  We are trying to see where our email can <br/>\n&gt;travel in the space of one month.  We will keep track of how many emails we <br/>\n&gt;get and from which cities, states and countries.  We are hoping that you <br/>\n&gt;will be willing to help us in our project.  There are just 2 simple steps <br/>\n&gt;that will allow us to track this email.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;1.  Please send an email containing your city, state, and country to<br/>\n&gt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:cb3braves@...\">cb3braves@...</a>.  You do not need to include your name.  Please only <br/>\n&gt;respond one time.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;2.  Forward this letter to as many people as you possibly can.  We are <br/>\n&gt;going to keep track of actual numbers of responses from individual cities, <br/>\n&gt;so send it even to those that live in the same town.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;We have decided to only do the tracking for 1 month.  We have chosen the <br/>\n&gt;month of March so that we can get the data ready for the fair in April.  If <br/>\n&gt;you receive this email in April, please do not bother to respond, our <br/>\n&gt;project will have already ended.  Thank you for your participation in our <br/>\n&gt;experiment.<br/>\n&gt;We can&#39;t wait to start receiving those emails!  We will post the results on <br/>\n&gt;the Tawas Area School web site www.tawas.net if you are interested in <br/>\n&gt;viewing them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this message is <br/>\n&gt;legally<br/>\n&gt;privileged and confidential information intended only for the use of the<br/>\n&gt;individual or entity named above.
