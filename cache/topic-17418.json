I had stopped at walgreens <br/>\nfor something, and had an extra kid with me.  THe kids wanted ice cream <br/>\nbut I only had so much cash and had forgotten my atm card, etc. so I <br/>\nsaid I&#39;d buy them what they wanted as long as it was less than about <br/>\n70cents each, which was about what I had left to spend.  Taylor and <br/>\nLexie picked out something pretty quickly but Janene kept choosing <br/>\nthings that were $3 or $9, or whatever.  Finally she settled on <br/>\nsomething that was $1.99, which I could have gotten if I hadn&#39;t of <br/>\ngotten Taylor&#39;s or Lexie&#39;s.  So I said no, she needed to choose <br/>\nsomething under the price limit, as that was the cash on hand.  She <br/>\ndesolved into tears.  I tried talking to her but it was 8:00 and she was <br/>\ntired and five, so I just put the things on the candy and started to pay <br/>\nfor them.  She was at my feet, screaming and crying.  I reached out and <br/>\npicked up one of her favorite candy bars, KitKat, and paid for that <br/>\ntoo.  Janene refused to leave.  She held on to the counter, screaming, <br/>\nout of control.  I picked her up and carried her gently to the car.  Her <br/>\nlittle arms wrapped around me and she loved on me as she was screaming <br/>\nat me.  I just held her tight, until she settled and then put her in her <br/>\ncarseat and we drove home.  About half way home I started talking about <br/>\nthe plan for the evening, janene and I go upstairs to cuddle in bed, and <br/>\nLexie and Taylor wait downstairs for Taylor&#39;s mom.  Janene started to <br/>\nsay she didn&#39;t have a candy when I told her that I had bought her a <br/>\ncandy.  She was so happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThisi s a long convoluted way of saying that a few years ago I would <br/>\nhave said &quot;she doesn&#39;t get a candy, she had a tantrum.&quot;  But thanks to <br/>\nall of you, instead I thought &quot;she is so tired, it&#39;s hard to make a <br/>\nchoice.&quot;  I don&#39;t think she saw the candy as a &quot;reward&quot; for her <br/>\nbehavior, as I have been taught would happen.  Instead I think she saw <br/>\nit as a--I don&#39;t know, Sandra, Pam, all of you, help me out, a symbol of <br/>\nmy love, that even through she was upset, I still loved her.  Maybe more. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she&#39;s quiet in bed now and I&#39;m going to go cuddle until she goes <br/>\nto sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17420,"nextTopicId":17415}}
