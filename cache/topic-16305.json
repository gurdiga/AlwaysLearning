I can relate.  The only problem is that the feeling is still there irregardless.  The key is to interrupt the Pavlovian response between the feeling and the thinking because thinking doesn&#39;t fix it.  I try to keep my awareness in my body where I can feel the tension and not on my thinking. I treat my thoughts in those situations as word bubbles, like from cartoons.  I don&#39;t grab them as they float by. <br/>\n <br/>\nThinking is addictive.  &quot;Just one more thought, then I&#39;ll have the answer, I&#39;ll solve the problem.&quot;  &quot;Just one more&quot; is the battle cry of the addict (I know from whence I speak, of course!)  It has never worked.  The only way out is right straight on through. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf I concentrate on fully experiencing the emotion, it evaporates.  It&#39;s that simple.  It&#39;s difficult to accept the process because it&#39;s so simple.  It&#39;s much easier intellectually to make it someone else&#39;s fault and keep doing what we&#39;ve always done.  When it becomes painful enough then we become willing to try some other way.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
