Just as she kept her children short on food and clothing, she also <br/>\nwas short on fondling and tenderness [feeling] the children should regard <br/>\nthemselves as useless weeds and be grateful that they were tolerated.&quot;285 <br/>\nChildren were expected to give love to their parents, not the parents to <br/>\ntheir children: &quot;We always appeared trembling before our parents, hoping that <br/>\nour official kiss of their hands would be accepted&quot;286 One boy reported his <br/>\nmother once dropped a word of praise, saying to someone that &quot;He is good and <br/>\nwell-liked,&quot; so that the boy remembered it all his life &quot;because the words <br/>\nwere totally new sounds to my ear.&quot;287 But kind words were rare in German <br/>\nhomes, so most Germans remembered &quot;no tender word, no caresses, only fear&quot;288 <br/>\nand childhood was &quot;joyless,&quot; &quot;so immeasurably sad that you could not fathom <br/>\nit.&quot;289 Yet this hatred of children in German families was not something that <br/>\nthey felt guilty about. German parents endlessly impressed upon the children <br/>\ntheir pride in their family atmosphere of hatred. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be loved,&quot; <br/>\nsaid one typical father, &quot;I want to be feared!&quot;290 Another father summed up <br/>\nhis feelings about family discipline as follows: <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;It is good to hate. To hate is strong, manly. It makes the blood flow. It <br/>\nmakes one alert. It is necessary for keeping up the fighting instincts. To <br/>\nlove is feebleness. It enervates. You see all the nations that talk of love <br/>\nas the keynote of life are weak, degenerate. Germany is the most powerful <br/>\nnation in the world because she hates. When you hate, you eat well, sleep <br/>\nwell, work well, fight well.291&quot;  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webpages.charter.net/jspeyrer/war2.htm&quot;\">http://webpages.charter.net/jspeyrer/war2.htm&quot;</a>&gt;From&lt;/A&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webpages.charter.net/jspeyrer/war2.htm\">http://webpages.charter.net/jspeyrer/war2.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":2678,"nextTopicId":2711}}
