I got her up and dressed and fed and out the door by 7 (a<br/>\nminor miracle there!) and we followed the local school bus on its route<br/>\nuntil she was bored. I told her she would be talking to her friends during<br/>\nthis time, but she was a little grumpy from the early hour.

I<br/>\ngave her worksheets and taught a couple of lessons, we had story time, etc.<br/>\nIt was cute when she would insist on my calling her by different names every<br/>\ntime she raised her hand, so she could act out all her classmates!

She hasn&#39;t expressed interest since, although<br/>\nshe did want to go to a local homeschooler science class this year that<br/>\nshe&#39;s really enjoying.

The little corner strip mall building thing where <br/>\nthat shop is is built right in the corner of the bigger corner which houses the <br/>\nhigh school Kirby and Marty don&#39;t attend &lt;g&gt;.

She sees them walking home, some <br/>\nlooking bummed, but others  walking REALLY fast and heads up and we&#39;ve talked <br/>\nabout that.  Some are anxious to get home.
