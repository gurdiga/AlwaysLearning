I also play a little piano<br/>\n(mother taught piano).  I have been brought up in a very traditional<br/>\nclassical method of instruction and find that it has a lot of limits (I put<br/>\nthis lightly!).  My experience with the kids is that if music is played, it<br/>\nwill be enjoyed, and spark an interest.  Play music from every culture,<br/>\nevery genre, every tempo etc.But most of all, enjoy it by moving to it,<br/>\ngetting some rhythm instruments (no knowledge necessary, really) and playing<br/>\nalong, and incorporating it into family events etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link to a wonderful author of children&#39;s improvisation books.  The<br/>\nonly book I have used is the one for children on the piano.  The concept is<br/>\nthat the child can make wonderful improvised music as a means to tell a<br/>\nstory, or create a mood.  The book is very easy to follow, and the child<br/>\ndoesn&#39;t have to have any piano training what-so-ever.  It is based on the<br/>\nidea that music is a creative act which anyone can perform.  This is very<br/>\ndifferent from the view that music cannot be played until you have &quot;learned&quot;<br/>\nhow to read music, or have been given the proper training.  I have used this<br/>\nwith my students, and they LOVE it!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/pages.html?cart=334763540414860236\">http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/pages.html?cart=334763540414860236</a><br/>\n&lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/pages.html?cart=334763540414860236&target=smp\">http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/pages.html?cart=334763540414860236&target=smp</a><br/>\n_artbrowseresults.html%26style%3Dartist%26artist%3DAlice%2520Kay%2520Kanack&<br/>\ns=pages-www.google.com/search&e=/sheetmusic/artist/K/Alice_Kay_Kanack.html&t<br/>\n=&k=&r=wwws-err5&gt;<br/>\n&target=smp_artbrowseresults.html%26style%3Dartist%26artist%3DAlice%2520Kay%<br/>\n2520Kanack&s=pages-www.google.com/search&e=/sheetmusic/artist/K/Alice_Kay_Ka<br/>\nnack.html&t=&k=&r=wwws-err5<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI also use drums in my classes.  Drums were probably the first instrument<br/>\nman used, using bones and skulls from dead mammals.  There are good books on<br/>\nhow to use a simple hand drum, and it is quite easy for a non-musician to<br/>\nlearn to play.  People who feel comfortable on a drum have many resources to<br/>\nplay these days.  Drum circles are more common now than ever, and students<br/>\nwho have had teachers introduce them to drumming have thanked them immensely<br/>\nfor giving them something that can help them connect not only to music, but<br/>\nto community, and spirituality.  Drumming is something that is done all over<br/>\nthe world, in every culture, and is closely tied to almost every religious<br/>\ntradition.  Here is a link to a few drumming resources:<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sagemandrums.com/\">http://www.sagemandrums.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.djemberhythms.com/\">http://www.djemberhythms.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.africantreasures.com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=Book0004\">http://www.africantreasures.com/detail.asp?PRODUCT_ID=Book0004</a><br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI am getting ready to perform in a St. Patrick&#39;s day gig.  I usually sing<br/>\nand play spoons.  My girlfriend taught me how to play the spoons, and it is<br/>\ngreat fun. She learned as a child growing up in an Irish household where all<br/>\nthe kids learned to play them (at their wedding, her sister brought a huge<br/>\nbag, full of spoons, and everyone had so much fun!).  This year, I have been<br/>\nasked to pick up the Bohdrun (Irish drum).  I didn&#39;t realize how fun it<br/>\nwould be!  I am using a video to learn, and it is working well.  But what is<br/>\nmore fun, is that my son is now playing along with me.  He tends to want to<br/>\nkeep the video on long after I am done.  People often assume that my son<br/>\nwill become a musician since both his parents are.  I don&#39;t agree.  But I<br/>\nknow that he really enjoys listening to it and will often grab an egg shaker<br/>\nor drum when we are playing, and I see how happy he is when he does!<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":24240,"nextTopicId":24242}}
