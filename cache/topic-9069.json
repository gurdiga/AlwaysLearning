Last night I talked to my friend in<br/>\nArkansas who is just beginning his first year teaching.  There is a<br/>\nformer homeschooler in his class and his observation was that the boy is<br/>\nlacking social skills.  He says he&#39;s shy and not swirling at the center<br/>\nof his peers attention.  <br/>\nBut he commented on another boy whom he really likes, who&#39;s very smart,<br/>\netc, etc, and laughed that this boy tells other kids to shut up and got<br/>\ninto a little trouble for shoving another kid around.  <br/>\nI asked him as gently as I could not to confuse social and anti social,<br/>\nbut I don&#39;t think he got it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDeb L <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; &gt; I guess there are many reasons people have for home schooling <br/>\n&gt; their<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children, however, the practice seems to be moving from an <br/>\n&gt; occasional<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thing to something that threatens the public school system.  There <br/>\n&gt; is<br/>\n&gt; &gt; no question that everybody will not be able or want to home school<br/>\n&gt; &gt; their children.  Our country became great and will remain great<br/>\n&gt; &gt; because all of the public are educated in the public school <br/>\n&gt; system..<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Not to have a public school system would result in our living in a<br/>\n&gt; &gt; country  with countless uneducated masses.  The public school <br/>\n&gt; system<br/>\n&gt; &gt; is being left with those parents who are disengaged from the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education of their children while those of us who care about<br/>\n&gt; &gt; education are withdrawing our support.  Lots of time and effort <br/>\n&gt; are<br/>\n&gt; &gt; put into home schooling... How much better our public school <br/>\n&gt; system<br/>\n&gt; &gt; would be if you parents would put even a small percentage of that<br/>\n&gt; &gt; time into volunteering your help, opinions and concerns with the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; public school system.
