And upon discovering that not <br/>\nall those things are going to grab you adn eat you in the dark, the child <br/>\nloses some confidence in the parents&#39; judgments. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m just describing what happened to hundreds of thousands of people my age <br/>\ngrowing up, whose parents told them what to wear, how to have their hair, how <br/>\nto sit, what to say in each social meeting, what to eat and when and how to <br/>\nchew it, what music was &quot;good&quot; and what was &quot;bad.&quot;  The kids left home as <br/>\nquickly as possible, became hippies or bikers or whatever, and let totally <br/>\nloose with sex and drugs.  That&#39;s not maybe, that happened.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not wise in the terminology of physics, but I&#39;ve been around real <br/>\ncatapults and trebuchets (and miniature ones too, designed for table-top use <br/>\nin food fights, but those are really rude).  If there&#39;s not a great force <br/>\npulling something back and holding it down, there can be no huge <br/>\nhigh-velocity escape vector.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf kids have lax, sweet freedom, they can&#39;t go very far or very fast.  If <br/>\nthey have limitations, the resistence builds up and builds up.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;But if you talk about your tastes and values to<br/>\nyour children and around them, they are likely to accept them as their<br/>\nown; at least, those of them that you&#39;re most passionate about.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIt won&#39;t be the amount of talking, but the truth in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;And it&#39;s harder to be passionate about not watching too much TV (what&#39;s<br/>\ntoo much, anyway?) than not watching any at all, in my opinion.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Shakespeare on stage uglier and more sinful than Shakespeare in the book?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same characters and situations and philosophical questions that kids can <br/>\nget from novels are also found in movies and dramas and comedies.  The same <br/>\nhappiness kids can get from an illustration in a book can be had from seeing <br/>\nanimated cartoons, but there&#39;s also soundtrack, and voice acting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids know tons of useful and fun things from Animaniacs, Sesame Street, <br/>\nMuppet Babies, which they watched as new and watch again on video tape.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur TV is much more used as a tape player and Nintendo system component than <br/>\nfor broadcast TV, and we don&#39;t have cable, but my kids&#39; happiness and <br/>\nknowledge and joy and long stretches of quiet days without TV are evidence <br/>\nthat it can be a good part of a good life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout having a TV, how do the kids see musicals?  Have they seen Fred <br/>\nAstaire dance?  Shirley Temple?  Have they seen ice shows--Disney on Ice, <br/>\nNutcracker on Ice?  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;d as soon banish books and the computer as banish TV, and I would never <br/>\nbanish those.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3251,"nextTopicId":3263}}
