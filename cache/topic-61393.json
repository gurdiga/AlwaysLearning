There are several videos linked.   Nobody could agree with all of them at the same time, philosophically, so don&#39;t get hung up on the idea of them as a set.  That wasn&#39;t the point.

My last post on that <br/>\nsubject ended with me saying--&#39;&#39;I wonder if I would be able to withstand any <br/>\nresentment that most likely would arise... I certainly hope that I never have to <br/>\nfind out.&#39;&#39;<br/>\n <br/>\nI have since &#39;found out&#39; in a very roundabout way and am greatful that logic <br/>\nfinally overthrew my ego =) I am now at a place that can see the family as a <br/>\nwhole being more important than &#39;my&#39; feelings alone and am open (if it ever <br/>\nhappens/arises) to my girls going to school if that was what needed to be done <br/>\nfor the good of our family, for the girls to have that stability and all the <br/>\nextra love that comes from us being together. (Without Resentment!) This only <br/>\nshifted as each time the subject arose for me, Sandra&#39;s and the others <br/>\nvoices kept popping up which helped me to think more about what being together <br/>\nreally meant and why I have chosen an unschooling path. For more family time and <br/>\nto enjoy eachother! It shouldn&#39;t matter how that has to happen if I can strive <br/>\nfor more peace and joy in any situation.<br/>\n <br/>\nNatarsha<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":61327,"nextTopicId":61305}}
