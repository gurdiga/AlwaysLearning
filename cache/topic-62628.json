The merciful God who tells you what to do once, and then you decide: Heaven or Hell.  It&#39;s your choice.  Whatever happens after that isn&#39;t God&#39;s fault, God knows.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been to hundreds of Baptist sermons,  Some people have been to thousands.   So I&#39;ve heard dozens of times and they&#39;ve heard hundreds that the husband is called upon to be the head of his house as Christ is head of the church.  If he wants to go to heaven, he will keep his wife Godly and will control his children until they&#39;re old enough to make that heaven-or-hell decision, with which they will live and die.  And NO JOKE, he&#39;s reminded, God sees everything you do and knows everything you think, so get out there and don&#39;t be a WIMP, you sheep, you fish, you child.   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other Christian sects that aren&#39;t so harsh.    There are several that are MORE harsh--they also tell people exactly what to wear, what music they can&#39;t listen to (Christian rock is Right Out), no make-up, no haircuts (for women), no jewelry, no zippers, no buttons, no logos on t-shirts, not even Christian godly-men logos...<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople outside the U.S. might rightly be wondering where I&#39;m coming from with this and where I&#39;m going.  Liberal Christians within the U.S.  might like to balance their calm, sensible, loving Christian churches with that, but even if the fundamentalists were outnumbered and outweighed, it wouldn&#39;t keep them from existing and being homeschoolers in very large numbers.  And for them, for the kind of people who curse their children with their &quot;NEVER&quot; and their &quot;don&#39;t care&quot; wishes, the kind of sweet re-writes people on this list are making would be silly, wrong, and dangerous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to look for some statistics on the size of the big Christian homeschooling conferences in the US, but found this and got distracted.  It&#39;s a very brief description of an upcoming California conference, by someone who has been to a couple of them but no longer is &quot;a Christian homeschooler&quot; [American trademark style].<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://boremetotears.com/2010/03/31/will-chea-be-serving-tea-this-year/\">http://boremetotears.com/2010/03/31/will-chea-be-serving-tea-this-year/</a><br/>\nIt&#39;s interesting in lots of ways.  No coffee?  Obama?  (She brings the names of a few of the topics (2010), which seem not to be about children or homeschooling at all.)<br/>\nBut this might need an explanation for those outside the U.S. (and some inside):<br/>\nCha-cha-cha-CHEA<br/>\nis a reference to the television ads for Chia Pets (and Chea heads came later, but weren&#39;t advertised on TV, as far as I know).<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzY7qQFij_M\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzY7qQFij_M</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Pet\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Pet</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOh.

Yes, Americans Christians can be Way OUT there, and yes, there are HUGE conferences of that kind of homeschooling and parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a quote from a vendor/presenter:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;A homeschool convention is like a religious revival meeting, because it is so filled with the spirit of parents and children bonding in a way that fulfills the true Godly function of the family.<br/>\n&quot;Most state-wide homeschool organizations are Christian in orientation, and that is because Christian parents were among the first Americans to understand what was happening to their children�s spiritual lives in the atheist, anti-Christian public schools. Rather than put their children in private schools, which they could not afford, they decided to homeschool, a form of education that existed in colonial times and in our early republic. The great advantage of homeschooling is that the parent does the educating and thereby creates a strong bond with one�s children.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thenewamerican.com/opinion/sam-blumenfeld/8127-get-to-a-homeschool-convention-and-see-americans-enjoying-educational-freedom\">http://www.thenewamerican.com/opinion/sam-blumenfeld/8127-get-to-a-homeschool-convention-and-see-americans-enjoying-educational-freedom</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll that is to say that the original &quot;My Promise&quot; DOES look like love to a lot of parents, and it doesn&#39;t come out of the blue, and yes it seems harsh to unschoolers, and it probably is, but within its own context, that kind of oppressive parenting is understandable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I hope my children find partners who will love them HUGELY and long after I&#39;m gone, and that they have friends who love them and maybe someday children who love them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[{"url":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tzY7qQFij_M?wmode=opaque","type":"VIDEO"}]},{"userId":262318461,"authorName":"Sara Evans","from":"Sara Evans &lt;sunrayemomi@...&gt;","profile":"sunrayemomi","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Alternative to Mainstream &quot;My Promise&quot;","postDate":"1314846008","msgId":62673,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBK2FrTlJoVS09eTJNYkUwRjBzdGtyQVAyUWt1YlBnUnppTEN5cXVnNHJTazJOckFLQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBK2FrTlJoNUpyUEhhaDBxNGpqYktVRHlYUkU5VDV6S0RTK0IyODFXVmhkK2FpMURRQUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENGODE5RDNFMjE1QjQ0NEFBNzQ1RTFDNjk1ODRERkYzQGRlYm9yYWg0M2YxM2ZkPgk8ajNtbTZsK3U2MGhAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+CTxDQStha05SaDVKclBIYWgwcTRqamJLVUR5WFJFOVQ1ektEUytCMjgxV1ZoZCthaTFEUUFAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":62672,"nextInTopic":62678,"prevInTime":62672,"nextInTime":62674,"topicId":62628,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Eegads how tired am I?!

Actually, that&#39;s how my mom STILL views our relationship and I am 35 and far from being a child. (it&#39;s been two years since we spoke.)  I take a deep breath when I see things like this.  Sometimes a couple.  Sometimes it takes a minute of breathing to move those feelings out. <br/>\n<br/>\n=you are still my child=<br/>\n<br/>\nI read this as, &quot;You are still MY child.&quot;  With &quot;my&quot; said with big, bold, loud expression.  Maybe that&#39;s because that&#39;s how my mom would say it.  That&#39;s baggage I get to heal by NOT having that attitude towards Austin.  When I am Austin&#39;s friend it feels good.  When I play with him and talk with him it feels really good! Sometimes I think about my mom when I am doing something with Austin that she didn&#39;t do with me (like play dolls) and I feel a little sad for her.  Sad, that maybe because she was the middle of seven kids her mom didn&#39;t have time to play with her or show her much affection.  That brings me closer to understanding her and farther away from resenting her.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really, really glad Austin feels like a person and not a possession.  I&#39;m so grateful that through being Ausin&#39;s friend and partner I can heal the baggage that came from being raised with the attitude stated above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;iaunschoolers&quot; &lt;iowaunschoolers@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve seen this sentiment before -- in emails and now Facebook.
