FAR from telling you to go away, she is telling you to stay and read. When someone is feeling a bit on the defense, it can often help if they stop writing and just read a while. When people stop trying to express and start focusing more on taking stuff in, perspectives change.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t worry about being misunderstood. Seriously, it doesn&#39;t really matter - if people really do completely misunderstand, then ignore their ideas. But I would suggest that you consider that you might be revealing more than you intend to reveal and that people ARE understanding and that their ideas would be useful for you to ponder. <br/>\n<br/>\nPonder is a good word. That&#39;s what Sandra is asking you (and others) to do before posting - ponder more, post less.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest you also decide to be brave enough to think thoughts that you might end up rejecting - but first try them on. For example, instead of defending what you meant about teens, take the risk of considering the possibility that your own words just revealed that you have stereotypical ideas about what teens are like.  Say to yourself, &quot;Hmmm, what IF I DO have such ideas? What would those ideas be? Where did I get them? How could they affect my thinking and my behavior? Do I REALLY think teens are that way or am I just unthinkingly speaking things I don&#39;t really mean?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPonder your OWN words along with others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, in the end, you&#39;ll decide you have nothing to learn here. But you might decide you have a lot to learn and that this list&#39;s very analytical approach will help you examine your own ideas critically and help you make moves toward even more happiness and joy in your life. Maybe.
