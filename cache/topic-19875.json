I come<br/>\nfrom the perspective that the universe is abundant.  I have shared my belief<br/>\nwith Alex that we will always have more than enough and will always have<br/>\nplenty to share.  I also discouraged grabbing and taught him to ask politely<br/>\nif he wanted to play with someone&#39;s toy.  They have the right to say no as<br/>\nhe does.  Sharing is a joyful experience and there is no reason a child<br/>\nshould feel it is about lack or a negative.  I have never been fond of<br/>\ngreedy adults and I think it starts early from a false belief system that<br/>\nthere is not enough.
