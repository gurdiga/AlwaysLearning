I hadn&#39;t  followed previous conversations <br/>\nvery closely, as I was not up to date, but I  just finished #6 last week, so its <br/>\nvery good to take part in *current* dialogue.  VERY interesting theories! <br/>\nI&#39;ve not got any ideas, myself, but I do know that  things in certain places <br/>\n&quot;felt&quot; wrong. As I put the last CD back in the box, the  idea popped hugely into <br/>\nmy head that Snape wanted Lily and *that* was the whole  basis for the <br/>\nanimosity between he and  James. Also, I wholeheartedly agree  with the phoenix idea <br/>\nmentioned there by Betsy.

That opens it up <br/>\nto so many interpretations....about all of the loyalties, vows, <br/>\nsacrifices and alliances throughout the series and the resulting <br/>\ntragedies. Maybe it refers to how, when we put *anyone* up on a <br/>\npedestal (whether its Harry, or Voldemort, or even Dumbledore), that <br/>\nwe will be, at best disappointed when they fall, or worse, at their <br/>\nvery mercy when we disappoint *them.*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Will Snape be allowed to live?<br/>\n&gt; Probably not.<br/>\n&gt; Damn you JKR for your obvious Snape hate.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think she hates Snape. I think she has, throughout the <br/>\nseries, portrayed Snape as a very sympathetic character. He has <br/>\nsacrificed his whole life for the cause and in the end may die for <br/>\nit (many believe.) JKR has given the world a gift in the character <br/>\nof Snape,and i for one am grateful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI saw a cool movie on YouTube:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jOmemLpcv0\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jOmemLpcv0</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI really think the author has a point, when it comes to that spell <br/>\nof being able to bring out the spirits of the people a wand has <br/>\nkilled (in GOF, Harry got to talk to his parents this way, <br/>\nremember?)...usually JK doesnt just mention something once, it shows <br/>\nup again in a later book. So, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione used <br/>\nPollyJuice Potion in CoS, it showed up again in GoF. I think this <br/>\nspell (cant remember the name)will show up again, and as the author <br/>\nof the YouTube Movie says, will allow Harry to talk to Dumbledore <br/>\nonce more (or...if you think Dumbys not really dead, will allow him <br/>\nto talk to Snape.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also read a really really great theory on the Harry Potter for <br/>\nGrownups list, which states that Peter Pettigrew will have an <br/>\nimportant role in the last book. Remember, in PoA, that Harry spared <br/>\nPeter&#39;s life. He owes Harry a Life Debt. Dumbledore made a big deal <br/>\nabout that, about telling Harry how significant that is. Then (i <br/>\n*think* in GoF??)Voldemort cuts off PP&#39;s hand, and then gives him a <br/>\nreally strong silver one. Again, significance of that not really <br/>\nmentioned at the time. It MUST surface again in this book, otherwise <br/>\nwhy put it in? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the theory goes like this: JK has stated (and i think Dumbledore <br/>\nhas also stated)that the prophecy is written very specifically. <br/>\nWords were chosen carefully. The theorist says if you look at the <br/>\npart of the prophecy which reads:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live <br/>\nwhile the other survives&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is is totally plausible the &quot;the hand of the other&quot; is the <br/>\nsilver hand of the other person standing there, Peter Pettigrew. I <br/>\ncan picture the scene...Voldemort has Harry in a precarious <br/>\nposition, he can kill him, (or vice versa), and PP has a choice to <br/>\nmake. Help Voldemort, or help Harry. He&#39;s loyal to V, he&#39;s afraid of <br/>\nhim, he&#39;s a coward. But...he owes harry that life debt. Time to <br/>\ncollect. Maybe that crazy silver hand is enough to kill Voldemort, <br/>\nmaybe it will crush the last needed Horcrux. Who knows. I&#39;m sure JK <br/>\ncan write it out better than i can. <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, i can&#39;t wait to &quot;see&quot; the look on Harry&#39;s face when he <br/>\nfinds out that Snape sacrificed his whole life, holed up in Hogwarts <br/>\nwith kids he can&#39;t stand, working for Voldemort, etc, just to try to <br/>\nmake up for what he did to Lily. That he wasnt the enemy after all, <br/>\nand that all of Harry&#39;s hatred for him was misplaced.
