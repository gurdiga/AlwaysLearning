I bet 15 minutes of sweet connection will go a lot further in the wakeup process than coming back for 30 seconds every 15 minutes to remind her, in essence, that when she does get up you will be disappointed with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy daughter still needs help waking up, mostly, if she has something to get up for.  but now, if I wasn&#39;t going to be home, she&#39;d use an alarm clock, even though she prefers me to come wake her up gently.  she will sometimes sleep til 3pm, and other times get up at 7, if she really needs to (for an airplane or a job).  she also wouldn&#39;t commit to getting up for something if she didn&#39;t plan to actually do it, but that&#39;s because I wouldn&#39;t push her to do so.   <br/>\n<br/>\nnot sure if 11am was the ONLY time your husband could get away for birthday stuff, but if you know your daughter&#39;s sleep needs and patterns, and that it&#39;s an area of stress already between you, you probably couldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t ask her to get up for something AND have a gift wrapped, at that time.  you could have scheduled it for later in the day, for instance.   set your child up for *success* not failure.

She won&#39;t learn to wake up for appointments and outings because you remind her ten times or a hundred times.   She&#39;ll learn it after she better understands her own sleep needs.  That might take years and it will surely take longer if she keeps feeling pressed to sleep and wake when you want her to. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember missing Dylan when he slept late.

Summer 2010 is shaping up to be The Summer that Pearl Slept.  My recently turned 13 year old daughter","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1302455527\">Boy does this discussion come at a good time for me.  Summer 2010 is shaping up to be &quot;The Summer that Pearl Slept.&quot;  My recently turned 13 year old daughter always did stay up later and sleep later than me, but lately it&#39;s been way more so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have read about teen&#39;s need for sleep and how they are naturally inclined to this type of schedule, and I&#39;m happy that because we unschool we can accommodate those natural rhythms.  If Pearl was happy to be a night owl, I&#39;d understand it and work with it.  But Pearl really doesn&#39;t like it when she gets up at 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon.  And I don&#39;t like it either.  I miss her!  I feel we are missing out on so much, that there are so many cool things we could be doing if we had more time together during the day. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ve been struggling with each other over it all summer, and many, if not most, of our days have gotten off on the wrong foot because of it.  One of the issues is that Pearl *wants* to get up earlier and go to bed earlier but says she just can&#39;t.  She says she&#39;s trying but can&#39;t.  I have responded that I don&#39;t see her taking any steps to change, such as going to bed earlier.  And by earlier I mean 1:00 vs. 3:30.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has asked for my help and I&#39;ve given it.  She has rejected many of my suggestions such as set an alarm clock and put it in a place where you have to get up to turn it off.  She says that will just jar her awake and make her make her want to stay in bed.  I see it as &quot;that&#39;s the point; the alarm&#39;s purpose is to wake you up.&quot;  But we got nowhere with that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe has asked me to wake her in the morning, which I happily do.  But then she doesn&#39;t get up.  Or she asks for 10 more minutes, then 10 more then 10 more.  I get annoyed by this; I don&#39;t want to stop what I&#39;m doing to wake her up every 10 minutes.  Especially when my experience is that she won&#39;t get up anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nShe spent a week at camp, and like the original poster, I had hoped this would be the event that would get her off the nocturnal schedule.  The two of us even discussed this. She had to get up at 7:00 a.m. each morning at camp, and she did.  But after she got home she got right back into her late to bed, late to rise schedule.  It was disappointing to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue is that I fear that Pearl has become a person who does not keep her word.  It is really important to me that my children be trustworthy.  She has very few things she needs to get up for, and none on a regular basis.  But sometimes there are things she needs to get out of bed for.  Typically these are things she wants to do, or things the family has planned to do, like leave for a weekend trip.  So we discuss it beforehand, often several times. I have a written schedule on the refrigerator that lists all the activities we&#39;re doing that week that will take one or more of us out of the house.  We talk about what I can do to help her successfully get up with the least amount of stress. So there is no shortage of information about the fact that she needs to get up for something.  And yet it&#39;s a huge struggle to get her up for that thing.  And often she says she didn&#39;t know she had to get up, or that it was that important that she get up.  It is baffling and frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:  it was my son&#39;s birthday, and my husband was going to come home from work at 11:00 so Cas could open his presents.  I talked to Pearl a lot about this.  About how excited Cas was about his birthday, and that her Dad was going to take some time away from work to come home.  The day before I asked her to please make sure her gift was wrapped and ready, and that she was awake and ready by 11:00.  I offered to wrap the gift. Short version: she wasn&#39;t ready, her gift wasn&#39;t wrapped.  It was a bad scene.  I thought it was really selfish of her to put this kind of strain on Cas&#39; birthday celebration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading some of the posts on this topic yesterday, I thought about how I could react differently, how I could make things better.  Pearl and I had planned to clean up her room together.  She had been saying she was going to do it, but she never got to it, so I offered to help.  It was super messy and kind of dangerous in there; there were sharp metal shavings on the floor from a project she&#39;d been doing.  Instead of waiting for her to get up so we could do it together, I just cleaned it up for her.  She was very surprised and very grateful.  And we had a good day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I&#39;m mostly frustrated because I am completely willing to do whatever I can to help her, but at a certain point she has to do her part.  And I&#39;m worried that she is becoming (or has already become) someone who cannot be counted on to keep her word.<br/>\n<br/>\nJennie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":373387508,"authorName":"troubadour4me","from":"&quot;troubadour4me&quot; &lt;ronniegreek@...&gt;","profile":"troubadour4me","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: 13yr old Boy","postDate":"1280962918","msgId":56687,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGkzY3JoNis3NzJsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGkzY28xaisybjJpQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":56683,"nextInTopic":56691,"prevInTime":56686,"nextInTime":56688,"topicId":56572,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have some tips for gamers and their systems and games.
