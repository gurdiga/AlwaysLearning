Most people reject it<br/>\nbased on the idea that a newborn cannot be aware of, let alone signal for<br/>\nand control, their eliminations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny... once it&#39;s proven to you that a newborn can do it, and does<br/>\nprefer to be dry and comfy and not wear a diaper... you start to see and<br/>\nrespect that there are a LOT of things they can do that people either ignore<br/>\nwillfully or because no one&#39;s taught them to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a lot like this list, actually.
