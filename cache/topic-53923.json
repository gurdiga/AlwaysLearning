So I went back to a website I used 5 years ago that had tons of links to ebooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis site is a Charlotte Mason Amberside Online site that had free Curriculum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided for fun to read the classics online and now my dd is begging me to read them to her.   If she wanders away while I read, I just keep reading and let her go off if she wants.   She liked a story about Robin Hood from a ebook Fifty Famous Stories Retold by James Baldwin.<br/>\nHeres the link to Baldwins book<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&book=fifty&story=_contents\">http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=baldwin&book=fifty&story=_contents</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can go back to the home page from this link and find a list of lots of book online.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are asking for reading aloud times.  They like me reading to them and I am enjoying some good reading time alone time too.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53770,"nextTopicId":53910}}
