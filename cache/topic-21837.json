It s a ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1303298921\">I&#39;m reading Cinema Nirvana, by Dean Sluyter.  It&#39;s subtitle is  <br/>\n&quot;Enlightenment Lessons fromt he Movies,&quot; and I&#39;m having a great time with  it.  It&#39;s a <br/>\nconnect-the-dots idea book full of  trivia, spirituality  and popular culture, my <br/>\nfavorite subjects!<br/>\n <br/>\nI wanted to quote a paragraph for here.  It&#39;s not typical of the whole  book, <br/>\nbut is interesting on its own merits.  It was in the chapter called  &quot;I <br/>\nBelieve in America,&quot; which follows the movie &quot;The Godfather,&quot;  though each chapter <br/>\nalso quotes and connects things other than the particular  movie being <br/>\ndiscussed.      (The *I* was just an  italicized &quot;I&quot; in the book, but I didn&#39;t think <br/>\nitalics would go through the  e-mail.)<br/>\n <br/>\n-=-  It&#39;s pretty easy to see how dangerous &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; is in the  hands of a <br/>\nbin Laden or a Bush.  What&#39;s harder to accept is that the danger  can start <br/>\nwith a Gandhi or a Dr. King.  If you say God tells you to treat  others with <br/>\ndecency and compassion, why can&#39;t I say God tells me to fly planes  into <br/>\nbuildings?  Who&#39;s going to adjudicate, who&#39;s going to listen to both  of our <br/>\nanswering machines and decide who got the right message?  That&#39;s why  *I* believe in <br/>\nAmerica.  Not so much America as a place, but the America of  the mind, the <br/>\nplace within us (no matter where we live) where we don&#39;t have to  bend the knee <br/>\nto anyone&#39;s invented king, whether on the earth or in the sky,  where we treat <br/>\nothers with decency and compassion because that&#39;s what we freely  choose--and <br/>\nwhere Tom Paine and Chuck Berry, Walt  Whitman and Susan B.  Anthony, Emily <br/>\nDickinson and Henry Thoreau, Frederick Douglass and Alfred E.  Neuman, Mae West <br/>\nand Lenny Bruce all teach us in various ways to shake our booty  for freedom.  <br/>\n-=-<br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s a fun book with serious bits of Buddhist teachings and Bible  quotes and <br/>\nquotes from rock&#39;n&#39;roll songs and movies.  As parenting books go  (it isn&#39;t <br/>\none), it&#39;s like Whole Child, Whole Parent.  The writing is not as  dainty as <br/>\nBerrend&#39;s (who is addressing parents of newborns and toddlers), but it  uses the <br/>\nsame style of varied sources, and calls forth the same  mindfulness and <br/>\nattention.   <br/>\n <br/>\n I really like Dean Sluyter&#39;s other books, Why the Chicken Crossed the  Road <br/>\nand The Zen Commandments, so I ordered this one before it came out and got  it <br/>\nlast week.  It went on sale Tuesday.  There&#39;s more info and some  quotes at<br/>\n_http://deansluyter.com_ (http://deansluyter.com) <br/>\n <br/>\nIt&#39;s easy to have thoughts sparkling like fireworks, reading this  stuff.<br/>\n <br/>\nThe movies he&#39;s chosen to use (though many others are referenced) are <br/>\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs<br/>\nTHe Biig Sleep<br/>\nIndependence Day<br/>\nThe Graduate<br/>\nEasy Rider<br/>\nJaws<br/>\nThe Truman Show<br/>\nMemento<br/>\nThe Godfather<br/>\nGoldfinger<br/>\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers<br/>\nFistful of Dollars<br/>\nJailhouse Rock<br/>\nA Night at the Opera<br/>\nCasablanca<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;ve read half the book, but not the first half straight.   I&#39;m  going to the <br/>\nchapters on movies I liked best first.  Some films I  haven&#39;t seen, and I <br/>\nmight want to watch them before reading those chapters(or  not).  When I&#39;ve <br/>\nfinished the whole book I&#39;ll probably put a review at  Amazon.  <br/>\n <br/>\nI love this stuff!!<br/>\n <br/>\nSandra<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":21835,"nextTopicId":21838}}
