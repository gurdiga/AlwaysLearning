The general<br/>\natmosphere was one of activity and purpose. Sitting there, I felt a<br/>\nmomentary sadness: Could I possibly give my children these kinds of<br/>\nopportunities?

If kids are in school there is always a timeline in <br/>\nwhich things must be done, taught, learned, etc.  School at home is <br/>\nlike that too.  The woman with the blog is very invested in that idea <br/>\nas well, to impart all of her motherly wisdom and embed it in her <br/>\nkids while they are still young and moldable, to ensure that they get <br/>\nall that she thinks they need to be successful people.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I&#39;ve gone down that path, my kids have shown me other <br/>\nways.  If a child doesn&#39;t see the need to know a particular set of <br/>\nknowledge, then whatever they get from it, isn&#39;t what you think they <br/>\nwill get from it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time, I wondered wether Chamille would ever understand <br/>\nmathematical concepts.  It wasn&#39;t that I was giving her math lessons <br/>\nand she was rejecting them, it was more that she has showed little to <br/>\nknow interest in it, so wether she knew any, was/is hard to tell.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGetting to know Chamille and really focusing on what she IS <br/>\ninterested in has shown me other skills and knowledge sets that <br/>\naren&#39;t particularly valued by the educational system, but valuable in <br/>\nand of itself, and especially valuable because it was/is part and <br/>\nparcel of who she is as a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaux is fascinated with numbers and mathematical concepts.  They <br/>\nare swirling around in her head all the time.  It is part of who she <br/>\nis as a person.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat bothers me about the classical education approach (I know we <br/>\nweren&#39;t really talking about that) is that it assumes a set of <br/>\nknowledge that must be known or the person is deemed uneducated.  It <br/>\nis the same with public schooling and school at home, the idea that a <br/>\ncertain set of knowledge must be learned in order for a child to be <br/>\nconsidered educated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to kids that are really great, and really value knowledge, not <br/>\nthe knowledge that I find of value, but knowledge they find of <br/>\nvalue.  How can it be any other way?  There is nothing in the world <br/>\nthat supports the idea that knowledge, not valued by the holder, is <br/>\nvaluable at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I died tomorrow, I die knowing what I know, liking what I like, <br/>\nvaluing what I value.  If I live much longer, I get to add to what I <br/>\nknow and what I like and what I value.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"The effect of belief on length of life","postDate":"1211211794","msgId":34994,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhFNTNGOTM4LTBFRTgtNDM4MS1CRDMwLUY5MjY3MUQ0NEZBOEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34999,"prevInTime":34993,"nextInTime":34995,"topicId":34994,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"The effect of belief on length of life isn t really what I mean.
