He was 72. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;With great sadness, Damian, Jarid and Jamie Harris announced the death of <br/>\ntheir beloved father, Richard Harris,&quot; the actor&#39;s family said in a <br/>\nstatement. &quot;He died peacefully at University College Hospital.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWord of Harris&#39; death comes less than two weeks after his agent stated Harris <br/>\nwas responding &quot;extremely well&quot; to chemotherapy at the London hospital. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the agent said on October 15 that Harris &quot;should be released from <br/>\nthe clinic soon&quot; and be fully recuperated in time to reprise his role as the <br/>\nkindly Professor Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of <br/>\nAzkaban, slated to begin shooting in March. <br/>\n<br/>\nHarris was reportedly hospitalized in August after complaining of a severe <br/>\nchest infection. It was then doctors diagnosed the Hodgkin&#39;s, a cancer that <br/>\nattacks the body&#39;s lymph nodes.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarris&#39; condition was serious enough to force the filmmakers of the upcoming <br/>\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, due out November 15, to use a double <br/>\nto complete some of the actor&#39;s final scenes. According to British press <br/>\nreports, they also began looking for potential replacements to be cast in <br/>\nfuture Harry Potter installments. <br/>\n<br/>\nLong before assuming Potter duties, Harris gained acting-legend status for <br/>\nhis intense performance in 1963&#39;s This Sporting Life. His turn as violent <br/>\ncoal miner Frank Machin earned him a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film <br/>\nFestival and his first of two Best Actor Academy Award nominations. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther key credits include turns as a squadron leader alongside David Niven, <br/>\nGregory Peck and Anthony Quinn in 1961&#39;s The Guns of Navarone and as a <br/>\nsinging King Arthur in the film version of Camelot, which won him a Golden <br/>\nGlobe. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut Harris&#39; most popular role (apart from Dumbledore) was John Morgan, an <br/>\nEnglish aristocrat captured by Sioux in the franchise-launching surprise 1970 <br/>\nhit A Man Called Horse. The film spawned two sequels and later prompted <br/>\nHarris to accuse Kevin Costner of swiping scenes from the series for Dances <br/>\nwith Wolves. <br/>\n<br/>\nHarris&#39; celluloid résumé also includes the 1962 Marlon Brando version of <br/>\nMutiny on the Bounty and Robin and Marian, in which he costarred with Sean <br/>\nConnery and Audrey Hepburn. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there were the mid-&#39;70s flops (Orca or Game for Vultures, anyone?) that <br/>\nprompted Harris to abandon moviemaking. &quot;I made a decision that half was made <br/>\nfor me by the motion-picture business,&quot; he once recalled. &quot;Around 1980, I <br/>\ndecided that was it, my career was really finished. I was doing a series of <br/>\nmovies I wasn&#39;t happy doing. The standard of the movies was very low. Because <br/>\nof what I was offered, I was unhappy.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nHe quit Hollywood, toured in a revival of Camelot and stopped working <br/>\naltogether by the late &#39;80s. Then Harris made a remarkable comeback, snaring <br/>\na Best Actor Oscar nomination for 1990&#39;s The Field, followed by a supporting <br/>\nrole as gunslinger English Bob in Clint Eastwood&#39;s 1992 Oscar-winning western <br/>\nUnforgiven. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore blockbusters followed, including Gladiator, in which he played Marcus <br/>\nAurelius, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, the first movie <br/>\nadventure of J.K. Rowling&#39;s boy wizard. <br/>\n<br/>\nHarris signed on to play Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore after his young <br/>\ngranddaughter threatened never to speak to him again if he refused, but he <br/>\nwasn&#39;t always so cuddly. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn inveterate hellraiser in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, the actor was once drinking <br/>\nbuddy to Peter O&#39;Toole and the late Richard Burton. Harris nearly died from a <br/>\ncocaine overdose in 1978. (According to one newspaper report, he had been in <br/>\nintensive care five times over the years and had been given last rites <br/>\ntwice.) After his O.D., and under doctors&#39; orders, he gave up his hard-living <br/>\nways in 1982--after downing two bottles of wine first--and had remained clean <br/>\nand sober since. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwice wed, he is survived by his three sons from his first marriage, to <br/>\nElizabeth Rees-Williams.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99944316,"authorName":"Nancy Wooton","from":"Nancy Wooton &lt;ikonstitcher@...&gt;","profile":"ikonstitcher","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Harry Potter - Hummmina","postDate":"1037576922","msgId":10736,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI5RkQ2QURBLjJDNDA0JWlrb25zdGl0Y2hlckBjb3gubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEwNS4xZmRlYzMzMC4yYjA5ODJjN0Bhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":10735,"nextInTopic":10738,"prevInTime":10735,"nextInTime":10737,"topicId":10699,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
