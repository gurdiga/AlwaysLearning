Maybe she wanted to own a backpack, or<br/>\ngo shopping for school supplies, or ride a bus (which was probably her<br/>\nfavorite part).  All of those can be arranged without actually<br/>\nenrolling in school.  Maybe she wants to go to art class or gym class<br/>\nor recess.  Perhaps you can arrange those as well.

She found it  <br/>\ngreat fun at first but eventually the bad points overwhelmed the good  <br/>\npoints and she decided to come home.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall it was a very positive experience since she found out why  <br/>\n*she* doesn&#39;t want to go to school instead of, basically, me deciding  <br/>\nwhy she doesn&#39;t want to go to school. It&#39;s ironic. We parents have  <br/>\nseen both sides of school and unschool so can choose from knowledge  <br/>\nbut we&#39;re raising kids who&#39;ve mostly only seen one side so they can&#39;t  <br/>\nspeak about unschooling with the same authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that I&#39;m advocating sending all unschooled kids to school to  <br/>\neducate them about school! They have the greater advantage of not  <br/>\nbeing damaged by school. Trying school, is of course, different than  <br/>\nbeing trapped there for 12 years. When you know you can come home any  <br/>\ntime, it&#39;s lots easier to see the nonsense rather than finding ways  <br/>\nto adapt and live with it as though it were the truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":95085137,"authorName":"beanmommy2","from":"&quot;beanmommy2&quot; &lt;beanmommy2@...&gt;","profile":"beanmommy2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"First grader trying school?","postDate":"1194443021","msgId":31323,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZnc2ZlZCs1ODY4QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":31324,"prevInTime":31322,"nextInTime":31324,"topicId":31323,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"My six year old has been saying that she wants to go to school, on and off for several months now.

She says she wants homework and to be <br/>\naround other kids more. She loves to pretend she&#39;s at school when <br/>\nshe&#39;s home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve tried to do things that can help with those desires in other <br/>\nways, like playing school with her at home, inviting kids over, <br/>\ntaking her to Sunday School each week. She likes all those things, <br/>\nbut still says pretty adamently that she wants to go to school.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve told her that it&#39;s a long day and there&#39;s not a lot of talking <br/>\nor playing, that it&#39;s probably different than what she&#39;s picturing. <br/>\nShe says she still wants to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... we&#39;re considering maybe enrolling her in the local public <br/>\nschool just to satisfy this desire of hers, with her being free to <br/>\nleave at any time. <br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone ever done something like that? How long did your child <br/>\ncontinue going to school? Did they enjoy the experience?
