The descriptions at AOBS (American Opinion Book<br/>\nService -- a decidedly fundamentalist Christian site) describes them as<br/>\n&quot;Their popularity is due to the comprehensive nature of their contents and<br/>\nthe disciplined thinking they inspire in the student.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a very interesting history -- with some fundamentalist sentiment<br/>\nthrown in -- at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aobs-store.com/reviews/mcgr7hb.htm\">http://aobs-store.com/reviews/mcgr7hb.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s part:<br/>\n<br/>\nMcGuffey Readers were most popular west of the Alleghenies and in the South.<br/>\nThey were popular for many reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n Children liked the Readers. They included simple yet charming stories with<br/>\npictures and rural settings with which they could identify. Other readers of<br/>\nthe time, published mainly in Unitarian New England, were written by Boston<br/>\nBrahmin types. Unlike the McGuffey Readers, the New England readers were<br/>\npretentiously aimed at gifted students from privileged families. The<br/>\nMcGuffeyReaders were created specifically for the growing number of new<br/>\nEuropean emigrants and for the rural American middle class.<br/>\n<br/>\n Unlike their New England rivals, McGuffey Readers were basically free from<br/>\nthe endless haranguing of social reformers on inflammatory issues such as<br/>\nslavery. Instead of a frontal assault demanding radical social reform, the<br/>\nMcGuffey Readers employed a more tempered (and more effective) method to<br/>\nteach children the evils of slavery. In a famous lesson called &quot;The Birds<br/>\nSet Free,&quot; a rich man approaches a boy who is selling caged birds for 50<br/>\ncents apiece. The man proceeds to buy the entire cageful from the lad. No<br/>\nsooner is the deal transacted than the man turns the entire stock loose,<br/>\nexplaining to the boy: &quot;I was shut up three years in a French prison, as a<br/>\nprisoner of war, and I am resolved to never see any thing in prison which I<br/>\ncan make free.&quot; Thus, under the guise of teaching kindness to animals, a<br/>\npowerful yet gentle anti-slavery message is taught.<br/>\n<br/>\n They were published in Cincinnati, the gateway to the American West at the<br/>\ntime. As a result, in their early editions, the McGuffey Readers were<br/>\nblatantly &quot;pro-Western.&quot; The Readers were written and compiled for rural<br/>\nWestern Americans. During the 19th century America was moving west both<br/>\nphysically and spiritually. There was a tremendous amount of regional pride.<br/>\nThe McGuffey publishers hoped to capitalize on this regional pride by boldly<br/>\nstating that these were &quot;Western books for Western people.&quot; In the 1844<br/>\nedition, as a response to the growing national reputation and sales of the<br/>\nMcGuffey Readers, they changed their marketing approach. With only minor<br/>\nchanges in the contents, the publisher proclaimed that the revised Readers<br/>\ncontained &quot;no sectional matter.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of pointless fluff, McGuffey offered an astonishing anthology of the<br/>\ngreatest English and American literature. The Readers feature Bible<br/>\nselections, as well as poems by Wordsworth, Byron, Milton, Whittier, Poe,<br/>\nEmerson, and Shakespeare. In addition, the Readers include prose selections<br/>\nfrom the works of Addison and Steele, Macaulay, Parson Weems, James<br/>\nFennimore Cooper, Blackstone, Hawthorne, Thackeray, and the great Samuel<br/>\nJohnson. With all the writers included, it is interesting to note that<br/>\nWashington Irving was the most featured writer.<br/>\n<br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic McGuffey Readers were revised many times through the years.<br/>\nNeither of the McGuffeys was directly involved with these revisions. New<br/>\nrevised editions were published in 1841, 1844, 1857, 1866, and 1879. Major<br/>\nchanges included a gradual mellowing of the overt religious content of many<br/>\nof the lessons. Still, in sharp contrast to the totally secular readers in<br/>\ncommon use today, even the 1879 edition presented God as the Father and the<br/>\nCreator.<br/>\n<br/>\n[And that last is a big selling point for the Christian fundamentlists.]<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":71442105,"authorName":"Jill","from":"&quot;Jill&quot; &lt;jillmca@...&gt;","profile":"jillmca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"McGuffey readers","postDate":"1025143865","msgId":7747,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMzgwMWMyMWRhMSRlZGMzZDY5MCQwMTAwYThjMEBXS0ZMTE1DQVJUSFk+","referencesHeader":"PDEwMjUxMzI1NjMuMTkyLjEzMTUzLm0xMkB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":7749,"prevInTime":7746,"nextInTime":7748,"topicId":7747,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... hundred-year revulsion.
