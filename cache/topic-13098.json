Sorry I haven&#39;t written in a while! (that&#39;s putting it lightly, I&#39;d say)<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time I read your stuff on AL I try to get moving but... well, you know how it is....<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m always behind on the list, so I don&#39;t contribute when it&#39;d just be old news!<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I just read (well actually a couple of days ago) that you have an article in HEM!<br/>\nCongratulations! That is soooo cool! Gee, maybe that means I should get a subscription! Do you <br/>\nhappen to know if the article is online or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s still the same old same old around here. I haven&#39;t found one other unschooler. The group here <br/>\nin Havelock praises god in every sentence. (though they are nice people but there&#39;s definitely _no_ <br/>\nconnection with any of them and none of the kids can read Harry Potter)  But the group in Morehead <br/>\nCity, a half hour away, is much nicer. We do cool stuff with them. They &quot;do school&quot; and church, but <br/>\nyou wouldn&#39;t really know it through conversation unless the specific topics come up. So that&#39;s much <br/>\neasier on my psyche. Jake has met one very good friend who also happens to have a sister six month <br/>\nolder than Rachel. But it figures, their relationship is much slower to get off the ground. Margo is <br/>\na very creative artsy twenty-ish (if you know what I mean) eleven year old who is very into boys. So <br/>\nthey haven&#39;t got alot in common, though do seem to get along ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe still miss all you guys. Jake still talks about the boys and Rachel about the girls. We were <br/>\ntrying to think of a way to get down there for a visit before we go to NY for the summer. On the <br/>\nbeach on base there are cabins with full kitchens and everything. We were thinking of renting one of <br/>\nthose for a few days. The only thing with that is that Pete&#39;s going to be gone for most of May and <br/>\nJune, so that only leaves next month. If we actually manage to get this together, are you guys going <br/>\nto be in town the last week of April (after the 27th)?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;I thought I was the only unschooler for a while, I started a<br/>\n </span></blockquote>group with just myself and one other family, and now we have a strong<br/>\nunschooling support group with a very diverse base.&lt;&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWow that is so great! I am so happy for you guys. That&#39;s my inspiration to not give up. Just shows <br/>\nwhat a bit of perseverance can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to say hi and touch base. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you guys are all doing well.<br/>\nAlice</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13083,"nextTopicId":13104}}
