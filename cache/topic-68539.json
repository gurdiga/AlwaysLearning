It cannot be bought. And &quot;cost&quot; is a difficult concept, so if you have an easy answer floating to mind, try to scatter it and look from many different angles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is in a private school, unschooling won&#39;t &quot;cost that much,&quot; meaning no one will send you a tuition bill and a steady stream of fundraising requests and tell you what clothes and shoes you have to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf both parents are working and decide one should quit work and stay at home with the children, will it &quot;cost&quot; a full-time income? In one way of looking at it, perhaps. But counting potential is a trap.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a family values love and relationships, unschooling can pay off in a jackpot of closeness and joy that could hardly be possible with school in the equation, and could never be bought back with a thousand hours of expensive therapy down the road. (Maybe factor in the time savings of not spending a thousand hours sitting and talking about what you could&#39;ve done differently, in addition to the cost of it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t need to be expensive, but anyone choosing unschooling simply to save money is making a mistake. If parents don&#39;t want to spend any money on games, toys, museums, out-of-town trips, books, or whatever it is the kids might be interested in, then unschooling will not work at their house.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne doesn&#39;t need to be rich to unschool, but it takes dedication and focus, creativity and resourcefulness.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68529,"nextTopicId":68498}}
