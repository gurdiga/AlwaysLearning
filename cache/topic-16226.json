Just as an odor can evoke waves <br/>\nof hidden memories, the sight of that yellow spine evoked such a strong <br/>\nand unpleasant memory that I actually had to leave the room.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat was the book? None other than the 4th grade &quot;New Math&quot; textbook; <br/>\nthe very one that has tear drops on many pages.  Tears shed night after <br/>\nnight as my Dad and I struggled to &quot;get&quot; the math.&quot;&quot;<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I realized when I read this is that one reason &quot;New Math&quot; failed is <br/>\nthat the education establishment, in its vanity, underestimated how much <br/>\nteaching is done at home, by parents helping their kids with homework. <br/>\nBy creating a new kind of math lessons that were incomprehensible to <br/>\nmost parents, a lot of students were &quot;set adrift&quot; on some stinky creek, <br/>\nwithout anyone to help them paddle to shore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I liked this idea.  I think that in both school attending and <br/>\nnon-school attending families, huge amounts of learning take place at <br/>\nhome.  I&#39;m often shocked when teachers think the solution to low test <br/>\nscores is to shut children in classrooms for additional hours.  Yikes!<br/>\n<br/>\nBetsy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16218,"nextTopicId":16229}}
