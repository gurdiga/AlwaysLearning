Like in the US, we have two main groups in Germany who would really like to get rid of compulsory schooling. One group are some fundamental Christians, and the other group are unschoolers and people who would like more educational freedom for their children, because they cannot cope with school as it is. I think the &quot;educatinggermany&quot; site is from a Christian person, I don&#39;t have any information about the owner. I just included it because of the translation for the petition, so people could understand if they want to support us. As long as we still face the situation of homeschooling being illegal, we absolutely need to work together for our goal, Christians, unschoolers, everybody here in Germany who thinks homeschooling should be a legal choice for every family.<br/>\n<br/>\nStefanie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; In one of the articles on that site there&#39;s a falsehood, repeated:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; -=-Homeschooling is legal in the U.S. and many other countries.
