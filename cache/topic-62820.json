That&#39;s not meant to be flippant, all the roughhousing he&#39;s doing will give him a pretty clear idea of what the laws of physics are as pertains to human bodies. And playing rough will give him a lot of insight into things like codes of honor and rules of warfare, too. Roughhousing is one of the ways kids learn about the differences between &quot;real&quot; violence and play. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts not the only way, though. Some kids play out ideas over and over with toys - maybe in addition to roughhouse and maybe instead of, it depends on the child and his or her environment. My daughter used to play out stories of violence and killing over and over with different choices coming into play. One I remember very clearly was after we read The Cat in the Hat where she played out killing Things One and Two in many different ways as well as going and getting Mother (who sometimes had a very large sword!) to come get those Things out of the  house. She was 4, and hadn&#39;t seen very many movies at that point. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your guy has watched the Harry Potter movies, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be troubled by Batman or Pirates of the Caribbean, and if he&#39;s home and can stop the movies at any time then I wouldn&#39;t worry. He&#39;s more powerful than the movie. A child who feels like he can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t like this make it stop&quot; is less powerful than the movie - but that&#39;s not your son. He can Turn It Off. And he can brainstorm ways to get past any icky bits he doesn&#39;t want to see - skip them? watch them in another language? watch the extras and see how the effects are done? Watch them with the sound turned off? Those are all strategies other kids have used when they&#39;ve wanted to watch a movie but had trouble with some &quot;scary parts&quot;. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Movie certification","postDate":"1315495581","msgId":62838,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwQUQwNzAzLTlEOTktNDY1My05MDk4LTMwMzU2NUIwMEVCN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEU2RjdBMDYxLThBOTYtNEI4QS1CRUNDLTlCRTMyRjZCQkRGMkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PGo0OGZiMCtlczdkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzgyRjhGNTktOTA5NC00OUUzLUE2RTctQzQ3MEY3MjFFQTUwQHZlcml6b24ubmV0PiA8RUM2NjREMjItNzNBMS00MjMxLUI2NjctMDJCODdFODE3RENFQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8RTZGN0EwNjEtOEE5Ni00QjhBLUJFQ0MtOUJFMzJGNkJCREYyQHZlcml6b24ubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":62837,"nextInTopic":62842,"prevInTime":62837,"nextInTime":62839,"topicId":62820,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But there seems to be this assumption that kids *prefer* easy solutions like punching their sister, or shooting someone with a gun.

But kids are  <br/>\nconstantly (mostly unconsciously) checking their ideas against reality  <br/>\nand refining them. (That&#39;s how natural learning works.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will hold ideas that are right for their right-now lives that  <br/>\nthey will drop in the future. For instance at 12 they may feel it&#39;s  <br/>\nthe ultimate rightness to put 12 hours a day into beating a video game  <br/>\nbut not feel the same at 16. Not because they&#39;ve realized they were  <br/>\nwrong but because they&#39;re different people, with different needs.  <br/>\nDifferent needs need different solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey will hold ideas that make you uncomfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they aren&#39;t hurting someone with their beliefs, it helps to let go  <br/>\nof the need to get them thinking right. It helps to listen to their  <br/>\nideas to understand why those ideas seem right to them. It helps to  <br/>\ntalk about why you believe what is right for yourself. It helps to  <br/>\n*trust* that universally good ideas are good for a reason and that  <br/>\nyour kids will agree those ideas are good too when they&#39;re  <br/>\ndevelopmentally able.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to understand that not all &quot;good&quot; ideas are universally good.  <br/>\nWe each have our own values and priorities. And part of unschooling is  <br/>\nallowing kids to explore and discover what their values and priorities  <br/>\nare (in respectful, non-harmful to themselves or others ways).<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn to listen with an open mind. Find out why those ideas make sense  <br/>\nto them. Share your ideas without pressuring them to see the (your)  <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; way. Trust that they&#39;re thinking creatures who can put the  <br/>\npieces together to conclude that they&#39;d rather live in a world where  <br/>\npeople don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay to murder each other as simple solutions  <br/>\nto any problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":183568025,"authorName":"Bob Collier","from":"&quot;Bob Collier&quot; &lt;bobcollier@...&gt;","profile":"quaussiebob","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Movie certification","postDate":"1315483948","msgId":62833,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo0YWJmYys4bWo2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0OGZiMCtlczdkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62831,"nextInTopic":62834,"prevInTime":62832,"nextInTime":62834,"topicId":62820,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

As a result of reading all the Harry Potter books over the course of 6 months we&#39;ve now watched all the movies with them too (except the last which is still in the cinemas in UK).  The boys have loved them and it&#39;s been great to be able to press pause if there have been questions etc.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 5 year old wants to watch the Batman movies - they are certified 12.  Andy and I have watched both of them and we own them.  The second one in particular has quite extreme fantasy violence in it.  I feel really uneasy about whether it&#39;s Ok to let him go ahead and watch these movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean has been mentioned too which I feel slightly more comfortable with but still not certain.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; My 5 yr old seems to enjoy being scared.  When we watched the Harry Potter movies he would often get scared and we&#39;d offer to turn it off but he&#39;d insist he wanted to carry on.  Sometimes he&#39;d come and sit with us other times he&#39;d stay where he was - on the floor or sharing a seat with his brother.  It&#39;s almost as though he likes getting that scared feeling!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; One other thing is that I am unsure how clearly he understands that violence can exist within cartoons and movies but that it&#39;s not OK in real life.  he is a particularly physical little boy and between them there is lots of play fighting, often going too far and I do my best to step in before it does reach this point.  The other day the eldest asked me what murder was.  I explained it to them and they asked if it was OK to murder someone.

But it did open up the conversation and we talked about it and I hope that it&#39;s clearer for them now!!<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So my main question is really about how to best make the decision about movie watching.  I would plan to watch the movies with them, at least the first time.  And we watch in our living room, generally with the light on unless they prepare &#39;cinema time&#39; which means everything is dark.  And of course the film can be paused, rewound etc at any point.  I just have this niggle about the content going into their heads and once it&#39;s in there it&#39;s stuck.  An adult friend of mine talks about how badly affected she is by some movies even now but that as a kid she found dealing with the content of some films really hard.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll leave it there!  Looking forward to your probing and wisdom ::)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Bea x<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I wrote this on Facebook yesterday after reading a post here, and also as a response to some anti-video game scaremongering I&#39;d read before that. I don&#39;t know if it will help or not, but it&#39;s a point of view at least. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I read elsewhere yesterday of a mother who was having difficulty relating to her son&#39;s passion for war movies and it got me thinking. I used to be a fan of war movies myself when I was younger and now I can&#39;t bear to watch them because they evoke in me very different thoughts as an (allegedly) mature adult and those thoughts make me feel uncomfortable and sad. Something I&#39;d rather not be.<br/>\n <br/>\nMy wife and teenage son are currently enjoying watching DVDs of CSI: Miami in the evenings. It&#39;s a marathon of depictions of violence in the most minute gory detail I&#39;ve ever seen and I have no intention of sitting through it with them. When I used to watch the original CSI with my daughter I would cover my eyes in the most graphic places. My daughter, on the other hand, was inspired by the show to take a degree in Forensics.<br/>\n <br/>\nThere has been a lot of research into the effects of violence in movies, TV shows and especially video games. I have a son who has spent a huge amount of time between the ages of 6 and 16 playing violent video games. Or, to be more accurate, video games containing depictions of violence - which became increasingly graphic as the technology improved. The side effects of his passion have been equanimity, courtesy, kindness, generosity and other qualities customarily regarded as positive. I&#39;m sure he would be a fascinating case study for the researchers. And it seems to me, while there are people like my son in the world, no one can claim it has been definitively proven that violent video games cause violence. Perhaps the difference between depictions of violence and actual violence is significant. I know from playing with my son that, for example, blowing the heads off Nazi zombies can be jolly good fun, no actual violence occurred and not even the pixels were harmed. Perhaps the &quot;side effects&quot; are not side effects but what would happen anyway. Marc Prensky, author of &quot;Don&#39;t Bother Me Mom - I&#39;m Learning&quot; has maintained that video gaming is contextual, by which he means, as I understand it, that depictions of violence experienced in a peaceful real life environment are processed differently than depictions of violence in a violent real life environment. Perhaps it could be claimed that actual violence causes children to play violent video games. Or, rather, to be obsessed with violent video games. Something to note about my experience with my son and from playing nearly all of the games with him over the years is that his passion for depictions of violence may have been predominant but it was far from exclusive, even when he played violent video games for hours on end. We watched two movies together over the weekend - Terminator 2 and Monsters, Inc. - and that&#39;s pretty typical. He watches Law & Order SVU and he watches Ace of Cakes. He plays Call of Duty and he plays Little Big Planet. <br/>\n <br/>\nAnyway, I know rock and roll didn&#39;t rot my brain. Yet still there&#39;s popular music and songs I won&#39;t listen to because of the &#39;sound&#39; or the lyrics. In the same way, I wonder about horror movies in particular and how people can consciously get up in the morning and go to work and conspire together to share with the world their appalling ideas, and how exactly is what they produce meant to benefit the viewer? And I wonder what my wife sees in shows she loves to watch like Supernatural, Torchwood, Spooks and Silent Witness when I would rather watch soccer or baseball. Mind you, I do enjoy Midsomer Murders ...<br/>\n <br/>\nIt seems more complicated than simple.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBob</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Movie certification","postDate":"1315483295","msgId":62831,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU5MDNGNzIzLTM0MjEtNDVGNS1BRkZELTI4OTk5QkYyRUI1QkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMTU0NjYyMzIuNzM0NzcuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUwNC5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGo0OGZiMCtlczdkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8MTMxNTQ2NjIzMi43MzQ3Ny5ZYWhvb01haWxOZW9Ad2ViMTIyNTA0Lm1haWwubmUxLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":62830,"nextInTopic":62833,"prevInTime":62830,"nextInTime":62832,"topicId":62820,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- That resonated with me hugely in regards to my own children, especially my oldest who LOVES stories and movies of all kinds and has since she was very very","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1382256588\">-=- That resonated with me hugely in regards to my own children, especially my oldest who LOVES stories and movies of all kinds and has since she was very very little.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was young, one of the Albuquerque TV stations showed  a scary movies on TV each Saturday afternoon.

As a result of reading all the Harry Potter books over the course of 6 months we&#39;ve now watched all the movies with them too (except the last which is still in the cinemas in UK).  The boys have loved them and it&#39;s been great to be able to press pause if there have been questions etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 year old wants to watch the Batman movies - they are certified 12.  Andy and I have watched both of them and we own them.  The second one in particular has quite extreme fantasy violence in it.  I feel really uneasy about whether it&#39;s Ok to let him go ahead and watch these movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean has been mentioned too which I feel slightly more comfortable with but still not certain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 5 yr old seems to enjoy being scared.  When we watched the Harry Potter movies he would often get scared and we&#39;d offer to turn it off but he&#39;d insist he wanted to carry on.  Sometimes he&#39;d come and sit with us other times he&#39;d stay where he was - on the floor or sharing a seat with his brother.  It&#39;s almost as though he likes getting that scared feeling!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing is that I am unsure how clearly he understands that violence can exist within cartoons and movies but that it&#39;s not OK in real life.  he is a particularly physical little boy and between them there is lots of play fighting, often going too far and I do my best to step in before it does reach this point.  The other day the eldest asked me what murder was.  I explained it to them and they asked if it was OK to murder someone.  I asked them what they thought and both of them said that they thought that sometimes it was OK to kill another person.  I was a little shocked!  But it did open up the conversation and we talked about it and I hope that it&#39;s clearer for them now!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my main question is really about how to best make the decision about movie watching.  I would plan to watch the movies with them, at least the first time.  And we watch in our living room, generally with the light on unless they prepare &#39;cinema time&#39; which means everything is dark.  And of course the film can be paused, rewound etc at any point.  I just have this niggle about the content going into their heads and once it&#39;s in there it&#39;s stuck.  An adult friend of mine talks about how badly affected she is by some movies even now but that as a kid she found dealing with the content of some films really hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll leave it there!
