THIS is the kind of poster I d love to know is adorning the space between bordettes on Emglish class room","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1567900035\">Dear Pam,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a great way to make the points.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHIS is the kind of poster I&#39;d love to know is<br/>\nadorning the space between bordettes on Emglish class<br/>\nroom bulletin boards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the appreciation of study of rules of writing. <br/>\nI am 100% in favor of everyone delighting in immersing<br/>\nthemselves in whatever subject matter stirs their<br/>\ninspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I  object to is the  mandatory, coerced and<br/>\npointless wholesaling of it to a captive audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent 2 years in public school classrooms as a Full<br/>\ntime substitute teacher in a very large metropolitan<br/>\nschool system.  That experience allowed me the view<br/>\nfrom the other side.  I got to sample what a day is<br/>\nlike in more than a dozen of the schools in the<br/>\nsystem.  k-12.  All parts of town.   Subjects from Art<br/>\nto Math and Vocational EMS.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI became a preferred sub in several schools.  Despite<br/>\nmy lack of an education degree, I was requested as a<br/>\nlong-term sub on many occasions.  A request that<br/>\nrequired the principal signing off on it as my Masters<br/>\nin Communications made me less desirable than those<br/>\nwith Bachelors that included training in classroom<br/>\nmanagement and other techniques mandatory for<br/>\ncertification.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have very mixed feelings re. my experiences over<br/>\nthose 2 years.  I know that part of what made me<br/>\nin-demand  was the ability to &quot;control&quot;   the<br/>\nclassroom.  To &quot;produce&quot;.  To fulfill the requirements<br/>\nin the teachers planning book for the day.  To keep<br/>\norder.  To prevent fighting, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nThe comments from students who I&#39;d had previously as<br/>\nthey see me in their doorway, &quot;Oh man, it&#39;s Ms. Nolan<br/>\n...  she&#39;s gonna make us work.&quot; .....  Gave me a sense<br/>\nof satisfaction back then.  I knew it meant I had<br/>\nestablished the kind of reputation that the teachers<br/>\nand school administrators appreciated.  No nonsense.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNow..............   Blech!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was often nothing more than a crowd control officer.<br/>\n Force feeding them their daily rations of gruel.  (As<br/>\nin grueling.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to make it pleasant.  To make the day&#39;s<br/>\nmandatory information as palatable and personally<br/>\nrelevant as possible.  But much of the material is<br/>\njust not Interesting or meaningful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also found that when I tried to show some respect<br/>\nfor students ....  give them the benefit of the doubt<br/>\n....   offer some trust, that I was regularly put back<br/>\ninto my place and criticized by the &quot;real&quot; teachers.  <br/>\n&quot; WE don&#39;t allow them to take a bathroom break before<br/>\n10.  It&#39;s in your Sub notes.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nBlech and double blech.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much more humiliation can we put kids through? <br/>\nRequiring that their bladders snap to it and stay on<br/>\nschedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo close to &quot;keep the trains moving on time.&quot;   for<br/>\nme.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was those experiences, and many more too numerous<br/>\nto mention here, that cemented my homeschooling<br/>\ntendency and turned me into a full blown Unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course my own 12 years in the same system as a<br/>\nstudent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand the fulfillment in teaching what you<br/>\nlove.  I had what was for me a Great Assignment near<br/>\nthe end of that second year. A teacher took leave to<br/>\ncare for her dying mother.  She requested me as I had<br/>\nbeen with the students a few times before.  It was at<br/>\na magnet high school; the best in the system by my<br/>\nestimation and by those who measure such things by<br/>\nNational Merit Scholars, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nThough it&#39;s public, application and admission is<br/>\nrequired.  It also serves the school for the<br/>\nperforming arts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I found myself teaching &quot;Our Town&quot;.  My<br/>\nundergraduate is in Theatre.  Master&#39;s emphasis is<br/>\nTheatre and Radio-Television.  I was in heaven.  (Oh<br/>\nyeah, I played Emily in college too.)   Knew it<br/>\nbackward and forward.  We discussed Thornton Wilder,<br/>\nwhat makes it a &quot;Great American play&quot;,  The time<br/>\nperiod, etc.......   We watched the Robby<br/>\nBenson/Glynnis O&#39;Connor version, which I also adore. <br/>\nThe teaching was thorough and, with very few<br/>\nexceptions,  they all did well on the tests.  It left<br/>\nme thinking that maybe I would do the year program<br/>\ncurrently offered by U of L that allowed grads to<br/>\nbecome accredited to teach in 15 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I came down from the experience, I realized what<br/>\nI had always known; that all of the &quot;have-to&#39;s were<br/>\nnot OK with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I think back on it now, i am glad that I gave<br/>\nthem what was probably a Superior experience than what<br/>\ntheir real teacher would have.  Because my Passion for<br/>\nit came through.   But I also know that there were<br/>\nkids in that class who were most likely bored and<br/>\nresentful at having to learn about something they had<br/>\nno real interest in.  And I doubt that that coerced<br/>\nrequirement, even with my glorying in it,  lead them<br/>\nto Appreciate the American theater or Thornton Wilder<br/>\nor theater in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many ways to learn the basics of any<br/>\nsubject.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as that goes, the real excitement is in doing<br/>\nit a way that no one ever has before.  Language is no<br/>\nmore concrete than most other subjects.  Even &quot;hard<br/>\nscience&quot; gets turned on its head on a fairly regular<br/>\nbasis.  And usually by someone who has tuned out to<br/>\nthe rules and discovered a new path.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am less and less appreciative of the step1, step, 2,<br/>\nstep 3... approach.  Interested learners will come to<br/>\nthe knowledge they  need to produce what they desire<br/>\nwhen the time is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is Unschooling for me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMelinda<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; This is from another list -- I thought it good<br/>\n&gt; timing for our discussion <br/>\n&gt; here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Pam<br/>\n&gt; ----------<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &gt;Rules for Writing<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;1. Always avoid alliteration.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences<br/>\n&gt; with.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;3. Avoid cliches like the plague.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;4. Employ the vernacular.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are<br/>\n&gt; unnecessary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;8. Contractions aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;10. One should never generalize.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/>\n&gt; once said: &quot;I hate<br/>\n&gt; &gt;quotations. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;13. Don&#39;t be redundant and don&#39;t use more words<br/>\n&gt; than necessary because<br/>\n&gt; &gt;it&#39;s highly superfluous.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;14. Profanity sucks.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;15. Be more or less specific.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;16. Understatement is always best.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than<br/>\n&gt; understatement.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a<br/>\n&gt; snake.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;20. The passive voice is to be avoided.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid<br/>\n&gt; colloquialisms.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be<br/>\n&gt; derailed.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;23. Who needs rhetorical questions?<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;24. Sentences without verbs--bad idea.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;25. Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;26. Don&#39;t use no double negatives.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;27. Verbs has to agree with their subjects.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;28. Avoid commas, that are not necessary.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;29. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially<br/>\n&gt; in long<br/>\n&gt; &gt;sentences--such as those of ten or more words--to<br/>\n&gt; their antecedents.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;30. Use parallel structure when you write and in<br/>\n&gt; speaking.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;31. Take the bull in hand and don&#39;t mix metaphors.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;32. Never use a long word when a diminutive one<br/>\n&gt; will do.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;33. Unless you are quoting other people&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; exclamations, kill all<br/>\n&gt; &gt;exclamation points!!!<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt;34. Proofread carefully to see if you any words<br/>\n&gt; out.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>=====<br/>\n: D  Melinda<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nYahoo!
