I didn&#39;t catch it when she used baking soda<br/>\ninstead of baking powder, or whole wheat flour instead of all purpose<br/>\nflour... so maybe it would go better if I were more involved... but she<br/>\nis so sensitive to people telling her what to do (except soccer coaches).<br/>\n This is probably the &quot;dance&quot; we struggle with most, when she asks for<br/>\nhelp doing something, and I have to give her just the right amount of<br/>\nhelp or information, but not too much or too little. Maybe because it&#39;s<br/>\nsort of a new thing... I mean, in the past she might ask me to tie her<br/>\nshow, or make her a sandwich, but now she&#39;s asking how to make a cake, or<br/>\na cursive Q, or how to draw noses the way I do them. We sometimes get a<br/>\nrhythm going, where I see where she is and give her thre next step in a<br/>\nway she can understand... but just as often, she&#39;ll get lost somewhere<br/>\nand I won&#39;t be able to see where she got lost, and she won&#39;t be able to<br/>\nunderstand what I&#39;m trying to say... and it gets snarly. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am imagining that at 15 or 16 it will be easier. Nine seems to be the<br/>\nbeginning of a new way of thinking for her...<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!

If my friend, who<br/>\nalways had lovely cakes ( devil&#39;s food? )  had given me this recipe,  I<br/>\nwould have to assume cake just didn&#39;t work for my family.<br/>\nIt would have been much more helpful to have an ingredients list and a<br/>\nplan for putting them together.   &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby made his first cake a few days ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was super helpful that he was fifteen before he tried to make a cake.  He <br/>\nwas interested in how it all worked, so the level of explanation was great, <br/>\nand he was entirely receptive to discussion of baking soda, and why the <br/>\n&quot;toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean&quot; bit worked.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have high altitude considerations.  He was thoughtful and will probably <br/>\nnever forget that with baking that IS a consideration.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would not have worked from the recipe, what really needed an example to <br/>\nfollow, was &quot;grease and flour the pans.&quot;  I could have said &quot;experiment,&quot; and <br/>\nhis first cake would have been a flop, as mine was (because I tried to figure <br/>\nit all out on my very own, because my mom wasn&#39;t a baker at all, whatsoever). <br/>\n My second was a flop too.<br/>\n<br/>\nKirby wants to try again.  I asked how much help, if any, he wanted.  He said <br/>\nhe&#39;d like to do it with me in the room, and if I noticed him about to make a <br/>\nserious error to say something.  We joked about how some people just do the <br/>\nintake of breath, and if you say &quot;What?&quot; they say &quot;Nothing.&quot;  We agreed I <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t do anything like that. &lt;g&gt;nts to make a birthday cake this Friday.  <br/>\nAND a pot of meatballs to put over noodles.  (The meatball recipe is a <br/>\nCampbell&#39;s soup, some additives, bought meatballs concoction, but his friends <br/>\nhad it here and loved it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s really excited about learning to cook.  It was just time, he had real <br/>\nreason, he&#39;s of an age to begin to muse about what if and when he might move <br/>\nout, and because I never forced him to cook anything, it&#39;s a desireable adult <br/>\nthing to want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4106,"nextTopicId":4094}}
