He is in the moment, is he not ?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAlways.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting dynamic:  Our whole family was at a conference, and girls  <br/>\nwere bristling over who was most with Kirby (just being not doing  <br/>\nanything particular), and some of the moms were saying &quot;oooh, Kirby,&quot;  <br/>\nand I said &quot;Marty!  Marty&#39;s the good one!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have adult friends who know me and Keith both and have since we  <br/>\nwere young and childless.  Those who like Keith best think Marty&#39;s  <br/>\nthe star of our show.  Those who like me better seem to think Kirby&#39;s  <br/>\nall that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Keith too!   And &quot;as they say&quot; (&quot;they,&quot; who say things),  <br/>\npeople are critical of those traits most like their own embarrassing  <br/>\ntraits.  So I see me in Kirby and I wish him to get better.  LOL.   <br/>\nAnd in Marty, I see Keith, only Keith without the family Keith grew  <br/>\nup in, without having been treated as Keith was, without having been  <br/>\nteased at school for being overweight as Keith was, without having  <br/>\ntwo mean older brothers as Keith had...  Marty is like new-improved  <br/>\nKeith!  So the people who wonder why I married Keith would wonder why  <br/>\nI doat on Marty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHolly looks like a couple of my cousins, and like some of Keith  <br/>\nsecondary relatives, too, we&#39;re told.  Maybe she&#39;s a package of  <br/>\nrecessives we won&#39;t identify with so closely.  When the kids were all  <br/>\nbabies, we knew Kirby was like me and my relatives, and Marty was  <br/>\nlike Keith&#39;s and his, and Holly was always a mystery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s some confession for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":337736493,"authorName":"Anne Mills","from":"Anne Mills &lt;anne-mills@...&gt;","profile":"anoellemills","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Marty at work","postDate":"1212034865","msgId":35116,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExOS1XMjE5NjE0NDAwRkUxQjI0MDg1RjY5NkU0QkYwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PEM5OEE4Q0E1LUNERTQtNDgwNC05OEQ5LUE3QkRCM0ZCMTkyMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PEM5OEE4Q0E1LUNERTQtNDgwNC05OEQ5LUE3QkRCM0ZCMTkyMkBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":35114,"nextInTopic":35118,"prevInTime":35115,"nextInTime":35117,"topicId":35114,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra, He looks so happy, doing things with dedication.
