My friends thought it was<br/>\nfunny that papers I wrote for others generally received higher grades than<br/>\nones I wrote for myself.  I noted this oddity and it is something that<br/>\ninforms my unschooling family&#39;s practices, I admit.<br/>\n<br/>\nA paper I wrote for a final year  English class in high school received five<br/>\nmarks lower than one I wrote for the girl in front of me.  When I went to<br/>\nthe teacher to complain, which I&#39;d never done before it was precisely<br/>\nbecause I *knew* my paper was better.  I had hand written hers, because it<br/>\nbegan as me proofreading what she had already written.  After I&#39;d liquid<br/>\npapered in corrections and re-written what she had, I offered suggestions<br/>\nfor the unfinished third.  She asked me if I could just write it.  It was on<br/>\na different topic than mine.  I had an hour before class and so I completed<br/>\nher paper, then fixed her footnotes and bibliography for her.  I used a<br/>\ndifferent pen, and the handwriting didn&#39;t match of course in the corrected<br/>\nsections and final third ;-)  I asked her for her pen, but she didn&#39;t have<br/>\nthe one she&#39;d had the previous evening.  My paper was done on computer and<br/>\nneatly printed and in a pretty file folder, while hers was hastily<br/>\nstapled.   We wrote  essay exams and my essay exams received the highest<br/>\nmark in the class, in all my history and English classes.  Yet, this teacher<br/>\nwas oblivious to this when she issued marks.  It never occurred to her that<br/>\nthe other girl hadn&#39;t written her own paper. We went through my paper line<br/>\nby line and in the end she raised my grade because she couldn&#39;t explain my<br/>\ngrade and I had a lot of fun reviewing with her what I though was good.  I<br/>\nmean I had enjoyed my word choices, my examples and the flow of the language<br/>\nas I wrote, so I really was happy to share that with her.  For her part the<br/>\nteacher was bored with my explaining how much I felt the subjunctive worked<br/>\nto give the paper a gender free approach and was less awkward than using &quot;he<br/>\nor she&quot; and I didn&#39;t need to break a grammatical rule by choosing &quot;she&quot; as<br/>\nmy universal pronoun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember one girl asking me for my study secrets, as she was a straight A<br/>\nstudent and the essay exams dragged her mark down.  I told her not to<br/>\nmemorize information or cram, but just write about the material she knew and<br/>\nunderstand.  I still remember the baffled look on her face.  I never studied<br/>\nfor tests--I just wrote what I knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have a teacher accuse me of plagiarism once.  I dared him to give me<br/>\nfifteen minutes to write two paragraphs on any topic he choose.  After this<br/>\nI convinced him by bringing in my sources, showing him all my footnotes, and<br/>\ngoing though the paper with a fine tooth comb with him though he raised my<br/>\ngrade.  At this point I told him I would get one of my other teachers to<br/>\nvouch for me as a good writer and he told me this was not necessary. He did<br/>\nnot give my paper an  A or A plus.  He raised my grade from an F to  a B<br/>\nplus, though he had just accused me of plagiarism because the writing I had<br/>\nhanded in was* too good to have written by a grade ten student*.  Ahhh,<br/>\nschool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn University I spent my first year writing papers for money.  It was<br/>\naccidental, as I started offering to type and proofread papers for cash.<br/>\nThen I received a paper that was one long sentence, with no punctuation and<br/>\nno footnotes.  I helped write most of the paper, while he hung by nodding<br/>\nand saying &quot;yes, that sounds good&quot;.  The paper written for a psych class, of<br/>\nwhich I knew nothing, received an A.  Soon others were knocking on my door,<br/>\ncash in hand.  I wrote, while in first year many second year and third year<br/>\npapers, and even an essay for a student in law school.  The law paper only<br/>\nreceived a B,  so she wasn&#39;t a return customer.  I gave up the essay<br/>\nbusiness though I continued to help proofread essays for friends, and<br/>\noccasionally &quot;edited&quot;  papers or &quot;punched them up a bit&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\n I even wrote a paper, while drunk, for someone who later became a primary<br/>\nschool teacher.

I remarked it wasn&#39;t as much fun as starting<br/>\nwith a thesis and then trying to prove it, but it made for a stronger<br/>\nrapidly produced essay to begin at the &quot;proof&quot; first and develop points<br/>\naround what could be gleaned from that information.

It implies that <br/>\nall kids in school do tasks they don&#39;t love.  I&#39;d even go so far as to say, MOST <br/>\nof what kids do in school, kids don&#39;t love.  That certainly doesn&#39;t cause me to <br/>\nwant my kids in school, daily doing things they don&#39;t love.<br/>\n<br/>\nI LOVE that my kids can do things they love everyday.  Doing things you love <br/>\nhelps a person find happy contentedness in one&#39;s life!  It&#39;s a gift I&#39;m giving <br/>\nmy children!  There are plenty of things they do that they dislike for the sake <br/>\nof something greater.  THAT is intrinsic motivation and if the draw of the <br/>\nsomething &quot;greater&quot; isn&#39;t good enough, they choose not to do it and opt for <br/>\nother things.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow is that NOT what people do for real, in real life?  People who go ahead and <br/>\ndo what they please in life often suffer guilt and shame complexes from feeling <br/>\nas if they aren&#39;t measuring up.  I&#39;m so glad my kids don&#39;t suffer from that, <br/>\nthey just don&#39;t.  They do what they do and act the best they can, not to avoid <br/>\nsome yucky task they don&#39;t love.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch nonsense!
