Thanks for the new thought you didn&#39;t  <br/>\nmean to plant!<br/>\n<br/>\n==================================================================<br/>\n<br/>\nOh sheesh...<br/>\n<br/>\nToday for the second time I&#39;ve read e-mail from a male-person who  <br/>\nfound my site looking for something or other and wrote to complain  <br/>\n(one was only half complaining, one was QUITE a-rant).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had already written something up about the first e-mail and it&#39;s here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\nThat&#39;s a blog I hadn&#39;t told anyone about because I hadn&#39;t had time to  <br/>\nthink of what I wanted to say about it, but basically it&#39;s intended  <br/>\nas a place to put things that are off topic or too deep or too odd  <br/>\nfor this list or UnschoolingDiscussion.  It&#39;s not about how  <br/>\nunschooling works, but about those odd issues that come up in and  <br/>\naround the discussions of unschooling.  It&#39;s for the hard stuff that  <br/>\nmany people think is worthless and not worth discussing.  It&#39;s for  <br/>\nthe stuff most people don&#39;t get or don&#39;t have time or energy to  <br/>\nwonder about anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, after I wrote and posted that, I got this other e-mail.   <br/>\nThe topic of the other e-mail is my Dumbledore page.   That one was  <br/>\nannounced at unschoolinginfo.com/forum, way back.  Harry Potter  <br/>\nspeculation.  Don&#39;t go read it.  But someone came across it and was  <br/>\nfurious that I had said something right near the top that spoiled the  <br/>\nbook for him.  I think that because the book had been out for six  <br/>\nmonths or more that was his problem, but still I felt bad.  I like to  <br/>\nbe surprised by the endings of movies others have seen already.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I added a long silly intro to the page<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/dumbledore\">http://sandradodd.com/dumbledore</a><br/>\nand if you want to look at the intro, just don&#39;t read any more of it.<br/>\nIf you do read more of it, don&#39;t complain to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for doing that, which I did months back (this guy doesn&#39;t check  <br/>\nhis e-mail much!), I restored someone&#39;s faith in humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Faith in humanity&quot; is one of those idiomatic expressions people use  <br/>\nwithout dissection.  I know perfectly well what &quot;You&#39;ve restored my  <br/>\nfaith in humanity&quot; means, and how it&#39;s used and what it&#39;s intended to  <br/>\nmean, but not until today did I see it for what it REALLY means.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of &quot;faith&quot; hinged on me.  My action (putting up silly photos and  <br/>\nspur-of-the-moment words) changed someone&#39;s faith in humanity (so  <br/>\nsomeone said).  I guess before I changed that webpage, faith in  <br/>\nhumanity had been lost.  Gone.  No faith in humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s crazy!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, no one should have &quot;faith&quot; in humanity.  In what, ALL OF  <br/>\nTHEM?  ALL humans are worthy of faith?  Faith in what way--trust?   <br/>\nSupport?  Acceptance?  Humanity robs banks and kills people.   <br/>\nHumanity abuses children and steals stereos out of cars.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we&#39;re not a team.  And if we WERE a team, neither democracy nor  <br/>\nconsensus would cause us all to agree and act as a single unit  <br/>\nwithout renegades or detractors.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where SHOULD faith be?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think now (as of about fifteen minutes ago) that faith is what some  <br/>\npeople come to unschooling discussions to find.  They want to find  <br/>\nsome people in whom they can &quot;put their faith.&quot;  They have some faith  <br/>\nand the urge to &quot;put it,&quot; and they look at unschoolers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF they  have faith, then they will... what?<br/>\nTrust what EVERY unschooler says?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when one unschooler says something unreliable or off, then the  <br/>\nperson&#39;s faith is broken?  Dead?  Betrayed? Lost?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;ll move this to that &quot;About Unschooling&quot; blog too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while I&#39;m announcing one blog, I&#39;ll remind people of (or  <br/>\nannounce) another:<br/>\nunschooling.blogspot.com<br/>\nIt&#39;s for announcements of publication of news, articles or research  <br/>\nregarding unschooling or homeschooling.  I wasn&#39;t the originator of  <br/>\nthat one, but have power-to-post now (along with Laura Derrick, Joyce  <br/>\nFetteroll and Pam Sorooshian).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":26194,"nextTopicId":26843}}
