We regularly take my 19 month old grandson for two or three<br/>\ndays at a time.  I bought him a wooden puzzle last week thinking that he<br/>\nmight be a little too young for it.  He mastered it the same day!  I think<br/>\nit&#39;s more of a joy to watch him play because I am older and I appreciate how<br/>\nwonderful every little thing he does is, but also, now that I am older, it<br/>\nis also a joy when he goes home.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrystal</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16254,"nextTopicId":16257}}
