Or if you&#39;re having company and have a lot to do today, let it <br/>\nslide.  It has to do with unpleasant current political realities and the <br/>\nsignificance of dates.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nand first, a distraction!  (for those who want to close screens without <br/>\nreading anything alarming and frustrating)<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been watching Sam Rockford movies, and so I watched The Green Mile.   <br/>\nThere is a sadness to it, but there is way more big good upliftingness (or <br/>\nwas for me, anyway).  It can&#39;t be recommended to everyone, and I shooed Holly <br/>\naway a couple of times (although now that it&#39;s done I think she could handle <br/>\nit whole or handle more parts).  I haven&#39;t much liked Stephen King stuff but <br/>\nthis I really like.  I forgot to tell her Stand By Me is also based on a <br/>\nStephen King story.   She loves that one.  She was really interested in this <br/>\none too.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam Rockwell played a very bad and very irriting man.  He did a good job.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay now, if you don&#39;t want to know what Osama bin Laden might be thinking <br/>\nand some way-pre-U.S. motivation for us to get our butts kicked, close this <br/>\nwindow until later.   And I left Jay&#39;s website link/sigline.  I&#39;ve known him <br/>\nfor 25 years, and he really is this weird, and smart, and twitchy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have thought of this myself -- the biggest victory of Islam over the<br/>\n<br/>\nCrusaders took place on July 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor an eyewitness account:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hillsdale.edu/dept/History/Documents/War/Med/Crusade/1187-Hattin.ht\">http://www.hillsdale.edu/dept/History/Documents/War/Med/Crusade/1187-Hattin.ht</a><br/>\nm<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy July 4 is significant to Islamists<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28159\">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=28159</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted: July 3, 2002<br/>\n<br/>\n1:00 a.m. Eastern<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBy Mark Robinson<br/>\n<br/>\n© 2002 WorldNetDaily.com <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Sunday, one of the &quot;experts&quot; in the endless parade of experts on cable news<br/>\n<br/>\nstated the obvious: &quot;I am unaware of any special significance of the date <br/>\nSept.<br/>\n<br/>\n11.&quot; His implication was that there is no reason to anticipate a terror attack<br/>\n<br/>\non July 4 because bin Laden didn&#39;t use date significance as a basis for<br/>\n<br/>\nselecting 9-11. Although he was technically accurate, he was pretty far from<br/>\n<br/>\ncorrect. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBin Laden is trying to raise the entire Muslim world to Jihad. Creating the<br/>\n<br/>\nmystique of the Chosen is central to his goal, and symbolism is the greatest<br/>\n<br/>\nweapon in his arsenal (thus far). Consider what he said (twice) in his<br/>\n<br/>\npost-Sept. 11 video: &quot;… after 80 years, the sword has come to America …&quot; He <br/>\nwas<br/>\n<br/>\nclearly referring to the resolution passed by the U.S. Congress endorsing the<br/>\n<br/>\npartition of Palestine (creation of a Zionist homeland) on Sept. 11, 1922. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nExperts on American news networks continually warn us that al-Qaida may be<br/>\n<br/>\nencoding secret messages to sleeper cells in their videos and communiqués, but<br/>\n<br/>\nbin Laden speaks openly, relying on us not knowing even our own history, let<br/>\n<br/>\nalone Islamic history. Which brings us to July 4. We, in our narcissism, <br/>\nassume<br/>\n<br/>\nthat July 4 is all about us. But to Muslims it is a day of ultimate triumph. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn July 4, 1197, Saladin (Salah al-Din) completely annihilated the 20,000-man<br/>\n<br/>\nCrusader army at the battle of the Horns of Hattin, driving the &quot;Christians&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nfrom the Holy Land until the 20th century. And we can be sure it is not lost <br/>\non<br/>\n<br/>\nbin Laden that Saladin won this battle in spite of the fact that the Crusaders<br/>\n<br/>\ncarried with them the &quot;True Cross&quot; (the True Cross was a relic designated by<br/>\n<br/>\nConstantine&#39;s mother during the initial phase of the paganization of<br/>\n<br/>\nChristianity). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConsequently, July 4 is a very likely candidate for a terrorist strike, albeit<br/>\n<br/>\nonly if the Islamists feel they have the means to achieve a final victory over<br/>\n<br/>\nthe U.S. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first question is, do they? Recently, al-Qaida spokesman Abu Ghaith <br/>\npromised<br/>\n<br/>\nto kill 4,000,000 of us, referring to America as &quot;Hubal.&quot; Hubal was the last <br/>\nand<br/>\n<br/>\nthe largest of the 364 pagan gods in the Kaaba to be toppled by Muhammad<br/>\n<br/>\n(al-ilah, the predecessor to Allah, was left standing). The image of Hubal was<br/>\n<br/>\nso large that Ali (Muhammad&#39;s son and the first Imam) had to stand on the<br/>\n<br/>\nProphet&#39;s shoulders to push it over. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second question is, clearly, is bin Laden ready to stand on the Prophet&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nshoulders now? That really should be a role of the 12th Imam (Al Mahdi – the<br/>\n<br/>\nlong-awaited Muslim chosen one who will convert the whole world by the sword).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe bin Laden has been hanging around a guy in really old clothes for a<br/>\n<br/>\nreason: Mullah Omar wears the Cloak of Muhammad (which he stole from a museum <br/>\nin<br/>\n<br/>\nKandahar). We all know neither clothes nor symbols make the man, but in an<br/>\n<br/>\neschatologically-based war, image and deeds together can be larger than life.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, most of Europe capitulated before Tiger tanks bearing swastikas and<br/>\n<br/>\nthe mere idea of blitzkrieg. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is reported that Bin Laden writes poetry in the style of Saladin. For bin<br/>\n<br/>\nLaden, defeating the Crusader army and knocking over Hubal on July 4 would be<br/>\n<br/>\nthe stuff of which epic poems are made.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Robinson is a scientist and author.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Jay<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\n| &quot;The future is inevitable and precise, <br/>\n<br/>\n|  but it may not occur.&quot; -- Jorge Luis Borges<br/>\n<br/>\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>\n<br/>\nStrange ideas for strange days: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.weirdload.com/\">http://www.weirdload.com/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":7773,"nextTopicId":7797}}
