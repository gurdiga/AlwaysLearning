They had been paying rent anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s running a game called &quot;Killer.&quot;  I described it here: http:// <br/>\nsandradodd.com/blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s about over; only two players remained last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday I was really, really furious at him, and shamed him and  <br/>\ntold him he was disrespectful, inconsiderate, irresponsible and could  <br/>\npotentially cause someone&#39;s death if he didn&#39;t find some way to do  <br/>\ndifferently and better, and that he had a good situation, isn&#39;t even  <br/>\nbeing asked to pay for his own liability insurance, not making car  <br/>\npayments, and that he has found some way to be happy not caring at  <br/>\nALL what I think or say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat went on for twenty minutes, in the garage, and at the end I just  <br/>\nturned and walked away.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was the worst violence of any sort at our house for a long time,  <br/>\nme haranguing him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was disapproving of something he loves, which is to wait until the  <br/>\ngas tank is as empty as possible before getting gas.  He called me at  <br/>\n4:45 on a Friday afternoon to drive ten miles TOWARD the opening day  <br/>\nof the balloon fiesta because he had run out of gas in a double left  <br/>\nturn lane at Wyoming and Paseo del Norte.

Marty had wanted to drive that car  <br/>\nMonday, and mentioned that there wasn&#39;t enough gas.  Kirby says he  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t hear it.  That&#39;s possible.  Wednesday Marty wanted to drive it  <br/>\nand there was LESS gas.  He did say something clearly, and I repeated  <br/>\nit.  Thursday Kirby hadn&#39;t gotten gas.  He assured me he was going  <br/>\nout later and would get gas.  Keith and I were going to costco to gas  <br/>\nmy van, and Keith asked me if I wanted to drive the Saturn and I said  <br/>\n&quot;Kirby&#39;s going out later and will gas it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT was the clincher.  AND the last two times that car had been  <br/>\nfilled were by Marty (with his money) and Keith (with his).<br/>\n<br/>\nFriday morning when Kirby was going to work, I said &quot;Hurry so you can  <br/>\nget gas on the way.  You said you were going to.&quot;   He muttered  <br/>\nsomething that I assumed would be agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing about the Killer game caused anyone the least bit of  <br/>\ndiscomfort or unhappiness.

It explains  <br/>\nwhy children need the opportunity to fight monsters and destroy them.  <br/>\nDevelopmentally it&#39;s an important step.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might also see what else you can provide in the home. Movies,  <br/>\ncomputer games, books about video games (esp cheat codes, man those  <br/>\nare great in our house) Trips to the comic book store, hobby shop,  <br/>\netc can provide more stuff in the house.

The last e-mail you sent was about 10 days ago. Give <br/>\n&gt; it time. Find something else to do while he works through the games, <br/>\n&gt; actually, sit and play with him. If you have a game system, get a <br/>\n&gt; second controller and a game that you can play with him and join in. <br/>\n&gt; But let him trust that you aren&#39;t going to start saying no again. It <br/>\n&gt; wil take a while for the novelty to wear off. Just like with anything <br/>\n&gt; else novel.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; It seems that you see this as a passive enterprise. I&#39;ve watched ants <br/>\n&gt; for hours. Heck E.O. Wilson has watched ants for years. If you were to <br/>\n&gt; stumble upon him in the jungles of Brazil it wouldn&#39;t seem like he was <br/>\n&gt; doing anything, except swatting flies, probably. It looks so <br/>\n&gt; incredibly passive from the outside. But a lot is going on that you <br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t see, that you can&#39;t judge. And video games are a lot more <br/>\n&gt; actively engaging than watching ants or birds or a badger sett.

Simon has definitely achieved a level of skill that I cannot keep up with, or, at least, that I haven&#39;t kept up with. He and Linnaea can spot things in a video game that I would miss. Their ability to pay attention to what seem minor things to me, but what turn out to be pivotal plot points in game or in cut scene, makes them much better gamers than I am.

If you have a game system, get a second controller and a game that you can play with him and join in. But let him trust that you aren&#39;t going to start saying no again.

Have you talked with him about the games? Yesterday Simon and Linnaea and I were playing X-Men 2 on our gamecube and they think alot about what they are doing. It looks very blunt instrumenty, but as their characters go up levels they have to distribute skill points based on what they want those characters to be strong in. So if you want Magneto to be more mentally powerful spending more points on focus is a good plan, but you don&#39;t really worry about making Colossus smart. After Simon has been intensely focusing on a game, he will run it out. Literally, he runs back and forth shooting and talking as he goes working through whatever has just happened and incorporating aspects of the game into a story. Sometimes he tells me the stories he&#39;s creating, and they are amazing. He weaves the most amazing details using whatever game he&#39;s been playing, or television show he&#39;s been watching as a backdrop. Don&#39;t dismiss what you don&#39;t know. Play the game, there is way more strategy and complex thinking going on than just viewing them may suggest. Certainly there is enough going on to keep your son&#39;s neurons firing for long after he&#39;s walked away from the game. And by suggesting that there is nothing going on in the game, you are slighting your son and his ability to find interesting things to do. <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I take him places to get away from the video games&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nYour sole purpose in taking him places is getting him away from video games? Really? Do you honestly mean that? Maybe you need to think about how you are approaching these games. It sounds like they are having a more negative influence on your life than on your son&#39;s life. If it is breaking your heart, why? Why can your heart be broken by your son&#39;s enjoyment of video games? I can understand feeling left out because of video games. Simon has definitely achieved a level of skill that I cannot keep up with, or, at least, that I haven&#39;t kept up with. He and Linnaea can spot things in a video game that I would miss. Their ability to pay attention to what seem minor things to me, but what turn out to be pivotal plot points in game or in cut scene, makes them much better gamers than I am.

I do sit <br/>\ndown and watch games with him, I find GTA to be an incredibly righ &quot;learning&quot; <br/>\nexperience, not to mention fun and funny. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, Zack asked me to buy a mini-notebook to write down his cheat codes. <br/>\nIf you are unfamiliar with them they consist of pressing certain buttons in a <br/>\ncertain sequence - right, x, triangle, left, up, down, down, etc etc. There are <br/>\nusually 7-10 buttons in a sequence. For many of thse cheat codes, he <br/>\nmemorizes the sequence and can do them very quickly, which is important in the game. <br/>\nAs he starts to write the codes down, I notice him shaking his head, crossing <br/>\nthings out, and sighing with frustration. &quot;Argh! I can&#39;t remember the codes!&quot; <br/>\nSo I asked, &quot;are you writing down codes that you know from the game?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Yes.<br/>\n&quot;Are these the codes that you can do automatically?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br/>\nSo I think for a minute, a connection is going on in my head.<br/>\n&quot;When you do the codes, are you thinking what buttons to push or are you <br/>\ndoing it by feel?&quot;<br/>\n&quot;No, I don&#39;t think about which buttons to push, I just push them&quot;<br/>\nAHA!!!!<br/>\n&quot;I figured it out Zack, I know why you do so well and I stink at those games! <br/>\nEverytime I push a button, I have to think, &#39;which button?&#39;, look for it and <br/>\nthen push it!&quot;<br/>\nAnd here I thought I was just a bad driver. LOL<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen people at registers that never look down at the keyboard.
