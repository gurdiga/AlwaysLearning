This week, for whatever reason, I got it in my head that it&#39;s time we started &quot;doing&quot; more with our boys and I decided we&#39;d try iceskating (my husband I know how). So, my husband (Larry), and James (5 yo) and Tyler (3yo) and I went iceskating for the first time together. I FELT I had prepared myself mentally for having low expectations and TRIED to have no expectations all. But then I was disappointed. Both boys had falls that squelched their enthusiasm quickly and they wanted to go within 30 minutes. My husband was giving me the &quot;I knew this wasn&#39;t going to work and now they both got hurt and this is a disaster&quot; look. And then I just crumbled on the inside. Cascading, catastrophic thoughts:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did I bother to try this?<br/>\nWhen are we ever going to be able to go out and have fun as a family rather than living in &quot;Cars&quot;-land and &quot;Thomas&quot;-land and &quot;Club Penguin&quot;-land 24 hours a day?<br/>\nHow am I supposed to know when/if they are ready to EVER try ANYTHING again?<br/>\nWhy is Larry being such as ass?<br/>\n$40 for 45 minutes of skating. $20 for a babysitter for Audrey (17 months). The inevitable lunch out that the will want for $20+. And, the trip to Toys R US for more Club Penguin and Cars &quot;junk&quot; with 20 pieces each for me to pick up off the floor that will cost God knows how much - yea! (with sarcasm).<br/>\nNeither boy has any athletic ability or interest.<br/>\netc<br/>\netc<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly, my thoughts were very distorted and immature. I was very pouty. It was a terrible moment of ridiculous fear-based, pessimistic self--indulgence. In the end, Larry recognized on his own that he had been very unsupportive and mocking of my hopes for the outing, so that was good. I got over my bad moments, but am still a little thrown that I &quot;went there&quot; mentally so quickly and effortlessly after a single failed attempt to iceskate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have felt for a long time that I had no &quot;deschooling&quot; left to do, and that may be true academically.

And that is what I have tried very hard to do.  And our communication and my understanding of him and how he learns has improved so much in the past year.  I can see how the freedom to explore and approach things and new activities on his own terms brings him delite.  Before all I was looking at was the fear.  He seemed so apprehensive of all new situations or people.  But backing off and accepting I can see that my son needed  space and trust.

If someone had said she <br/>\ncouldn&#39;t swing on a swing that way she needed to sit down on the swing, she <br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have swung. She would have found something else to do. She is fine <br/>\nsitting on a swing now, she is fine with being pushed, or push her own self.

There&#39;s a big difference<br/>\nin power, adult to child.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most important things about being a powerless child is<br/>\nhaving an adult who empowers them to learn a bit at a time what the<br/>\nchild wants to do for themselves. If the parent is the one choosing<br/>\nwhat is good for a child to do or not do (like taking classes), then<br/>\nthe child loses freedom of choice in the most basic things -- not<br/>\nbeing able to choose what they want to do with their time, what they<br/>\nwant to have in their heads to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could put your child in classes instead of waiting until your<br/>\nchild is motivated to seek instruction for reasons of his own. If you<br/>\npush, then he may agree, and whether that&#39;s a bad or good experience,<br/>\nit wasn&#39;t his idea but to please you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that what you are after?<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":170380942,"authorName":"Lisa","from":"&quot;Lisa&quot; &lt;lisa@...&gt;","profile":"cslisacs","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: won&#39;t take any sort of a class","postDate":"1294622789","msgId":58840,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlnZG44NStqaHVtQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGluSHd6MkYrTjk1Um1kSE1pOTVQZzZlbWdwcXM0T25GSDd6T3YwTUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58838,"nextInTopic":58844,"prevInTime":58839,"nextInTime":58841,"topicId":58836,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I read here every day and try to get the gist of unschooling.  For the most part I think we do well, but we have occassional bumps in the road I want help with.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is 7, almost 8.  He went to preschool at 2 and 3 and was kicked out of two different schools for aggression and strong-willed-ness.  It was then that I decided to homeschool him and I found unschooling shortly thereafter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis emotions come very hard and fast and intense and both his father and I are like that too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am having scared thoughts and feelings right now because I feel like our lifestyle of giving him complete freedom of choice is setting him up for failure in some ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a few weeks ago, we went to a kind of free play at an artsy school gym where they had juggling toys out.  There was a big hard ball that some of the kids were standing on and balancing on and he said he wanted to try it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI talked to someone about getting a ball and the man indicated that he would need to help Joe on it and show him how to do it.  Joe indicated immediate fear and said he didn&#39;t want to do it anymore.  I knew that was because he didn&#39;t want that man &#39;instructing&#39; him.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn&#39;t want to do anything where someone else instructs him and he says &quot;I don&#39;t want someone else to teach me anything&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like this is an issue.  I feel like he will deliberately choose not to do things he really wants to do if his father or I can&#39;t be the ones helping him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like we have provided this safe little cocooned world for him, and rather than that making him stronger and better able to deal with the outside world it has made him weaker and less able to deal with the outside world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t want to be the reason that my son turns into some kind of hermit or .... I don&#39;t know what.  I could envision things like never getting his drivers license or never doing anything outside the home.  help please.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58723,"nextTopicId":58894}}
