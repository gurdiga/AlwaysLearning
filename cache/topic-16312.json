My 6yo daughter told us this<br/>\nweekend that she wanted to go to 1st grade.  My husband and I talked<br/>\nabout it and decided that it would be best if we asked a friend of ours<br/>\nwho teaches if we could sit in her classroom for the day, that way we<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t be enrolling and then possibly dropping out the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe said no problem (she has always been supportive of our<br/>\nunschooling).  So Monday bright and early we got up, got dressed, ate<br/>\nbreakfast, made lunches and headed out.  There were three of us - me,<br/>\nRobin (son-8 1/2) and Storey (daughter-6).<br/>\n<br/>\nNatalie (my friend, the teacher) had written two sentences that needed<br/>\ncorrecting on the board.  Neither of my children can read yet, but I<br/>\nread the board to them and they told me what was wrong with the<br/>\nsentences and wrote them correctly on a sheet of paper.  Then we<br/>\nlistened to a story and participated in answering questions about the<br/>\nstory (my son asked me why Natalie was asking these questions - did she<br/>\nthink we hadn&#39;t been listening?)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlready my kids were getting out of their chairs and starting to wander<br/>\naround, which  of course was being noticed by the other kids in the room<br/>\nand they were starting to pop out of their seats too.  Recess was still<br/>\npretty far away but somehow we managed to get there without me having to<br/>\nremind them to sit and be still.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter lunch the kids had to take the second part of a standardized test<br/>\n(that&#39;s where the quote above comes in).  They were being timed.  It was<br/>\nsubtraction, 50 questions, and it said at the top that the test should<br/>\nbe completed in 5 minutes or less.  Natalie sat and did the key - it<br/>\ntook her 5 minutes to do that!!  Needless to say, the quickest time was<br/>\n6.5 minutes and the longest was 33 minutes.  Silly testing.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s the best part:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids took the test too, just for fun.  Storey did about half of them<br/>\nand then asked if she had to finish it.  I told her only if she wanted<br/>\nto.  She said it was just the same thing over and over and didn&#39;t they<br/>\nalready know that she knew it?  Why did she have to keep answering the<br/>\nsame thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin looked at the first problem (7-3=?) and found a different 7 on the<br/>\npage, circled it then found a different 3, circled it and drew a line to<br/>\nthe 7, then found a four and drew a line to it.  He did this for about<br/>\n10 problems.  Natalie was sitting at the table next to him watching,<br/>\nfascinated.  She told him that she had never seen anyone do it that way<br/>\nand was very impressed.  (She was too, she called me later and we talked<br/>\nabout the kids creativity.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, long story later,  I got to watch my lifelong unschoolers take a<br/>\nstandardized test in a 2nd grade classroom.  I got to see how children<br/>\nwho have never had to do math problems or workbooks or anything like<br/>\nthat, do well on a California Standardized test.  I am so blown away<br/>\nthat this unschooling actually works SO much better than regular<br/>\nschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told my mom about this.  Her response?  To tell me that she was<br/>\napprehensive at first (that&#39;s an understatement) but now that the kids<br/>\nare older and she&#39;s around them more and of course this new story about<br/>\nthe testing.  She now thinks I may be right with this unschooling thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk.  I&#39;m done.  Was any of this understandable?  I&#39;m not a writer, I&#39;m<br/>\nsure that&#39;s clear.  But it was such an amazing adventure I felt<br/>\ncompelled to share it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, neither of the kids want to go to school, there is a greater<br/>\nappreciation for our way now.<br/>\n<br/>\nKate</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":150527288,"authorName":"Ren","from":"Ren &lt;starsuncloud@...&gt;","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"feeling like an idiot","postDate":"1063737237","msgId":16324,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwOTE2LjExMzQxNS4yODIwMi4xNTAxMzhAd2VibWFpbDE2Lm55Yy51bnRkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":16323,"nextInTopic":16332,"prevInTime":16323,"nextInTime":16325,"topicId":16312,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Should I just not bother talking to people unless I know they are also questioning the status quo?

I don&#39;t usually say much about this reading to people unless I know they are also interested in homeschooling or alternative education.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I do have some people in my life that I would like to share these ideas with.  These ideas are so totally changing my life that I want to share them with people who are part of my life.  One of them is my husband.  Others are close friends who either send their kids to public school or whose children are grown.  These people are not doing the reading I&#39;m doing.  When I share the things I&#39;m reading about, they respond in such mainstream ways, yet I can&#39;t seem to come up with the words to back up these *new* ideas.  (Not new ideas to most of you on this list, I&#39;m sure!)  It is so frustrating!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, a recent dinner conversation evolved to schools and standardized testing.  I suggested that children would benefit more by putting money into smaller class sizes instead of into testing.  *D* insisted that testing is the only way we can know if smaller class sizes or other changes in the system are working.  I couldn&#39;t think of anything to say to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I just not bother talking to people unless I know they are also questioning the status quo?  I hate to think that I can only have meaningful conversations with people who already think as I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16236,"nextTopicId":16339}}
