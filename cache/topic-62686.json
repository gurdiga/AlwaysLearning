That<br/>\nsame grandmother paid for my college tuition. I&#39;m very grateful to her. I<br/>\nlived with her, my grandfather and one of my great aunts and her husband<br/>\nafter my parents divorced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was one of those kids who asked for family stories instead of stories from<br/>\nbooks, so I learned all kinds of interesting details about early 20th<br/>\ncentury life in a small Midwestern farming community. Oranges for Christmas<br/>\nwere popular in Ohio too  - I heard about what a treat they were to my<br/>\ngrandparent&#39;s generation, I received one in the toe of my stocking every<br/>\nChristmas, and now I put an orange in the toe of my daughters&#39; Christmas<br/>\nstockings because it reminds me of my grandfather.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nI think the demonizing of schools is often a phase that<br/>\nhomeschooling/unschooling parents pass through, in the same way that<br/>\ndeschooling is a phase.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong before I ever considered homeschooling or heard of unschooling, when my<br/>\nchildren were very young, I was elected twice to our local school board. One<br/>\nthing I learned from that experience was that there are more parents than<br/>\nyou would think who have issues that make school a better place than home.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven though I was aware of that when we were new homeschoolers (seven years<br/>\nago), I remember reading John Taylor Gatto and feeling enjoyably<br/>\nself-righteous. His writing doesn&#39;t evoke the same response in me today.<br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\nThank you for pointing out Shorpy. Another website I like is Retronaut.
