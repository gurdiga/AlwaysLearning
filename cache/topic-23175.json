We had to, we have lots! The kids and I learned our bladders are bigger than we thought. Besides dealing with limited space, elbows in eyes, feet in faces, we got along amazingly and had lots of fun looking at America. The best thing, for our family, is we learned tolerance.  Admittedly we still have a long way to go on that one,  but before, I think, we had next to none. (that sentence makes no sense, but my poor, addled, moved-too-much mind can&#39;t get it right.) Sorry, I know its a crappy, too short answer for your question, but there&#39;s that mushy brain syndrome going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAngela &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:game-enthusiast@...\">game-enthusiast@...</a>&gt; wrote:I remember you Nancy.

I&#39;m Nancy, I used to be on this list and others... left about 18 months ago. Why leave such wonderful company?  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>\nMy husband has a semi truck and we decided to put all our worldly possessions in storage and take the whole family to see the USA, parts of Mexico, and Canada. What fun! Two kids, two adults, the dog, all stuffed in a space about 8&#39;x12&#39;. tee hee hee. We did this for about seven months, then the kids, dog, and I got off the truck, waved bye to Dad and bummed around this past summer. We stretched our legs, laid around in the sun doing nothing, looked for a house and tried to spend as little time in the same room as each other as we possibly could. I really thought we were going to be this unique little family doing the modern day version of pioneering, but here and there in truck stops, Wal-Mart distribution centers, and meat packing plants I found other homeschooling families. We were the only unschoolers I found. I couldn&#39;t understand how their kids did school work on a moving truck and they couldn&#39;t understand how I kept mine occupied and out of my hair mile after mile. <br/>\n <br/>\nSo long story short... we found a nice little house in Springfield, MO.  I always wanted out of Topeka, KS., and since Darin&#39;s company is based here we decided to settle here. &lt;duh&gt; <br/>\nIt&#39;s good to be back, and nice to see the old &#39;sugar, food, TV, limitation&#39;, argument may fade away but never dies. &lt;g&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\nNancy Edds-Owens<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23171,"nextTopicId":23229}}
