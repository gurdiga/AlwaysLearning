Have some massages, read<br/>\nsome books, even watch a short show, and then let them snuggle off<br/>\ntogether. Then you can get up or, as I do sometimes, have the light on low<br/>\nand read near them.

Adults that<br/>\n&gt;&gt;understand this (and know that many do NOT!), go out and get what they<br/>\n&gt;&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;&gt;<br/>\n&gt;want. Some of<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;&gt;those very adults believe that children are incapable of this. *WE* know<br/>\n&gt;&gt;better! Children are quite capable of knowing what they want.

Go figure.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To me, Unschooling is following your dreams and your desires. *Some* of<br/>\nmine<br/>\n&gt; are listed above. There are others....many others! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; This lifestyle isn&#39;t *just* about my children. It&#39;s about me and my<br/>\nhusband<br/>\n&gt; and you and yours and ---it&#39;s about truly understanding that learning<br/>\nhappens<br/>\n&gt; all the time, no matter how old or young you are.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Our unschooling children need us to facilitate---to make it easy for them<br/>\nto<br/>\n&gt; reach *their* dreams and goals, big ones and little ones. Adults that<br/>\n&gt; understand this (and know that many do NOT!), go out and get what they<br/>\nwant. Some of<br/>\n&gt; those very adults believe that children are incapable of this. *WE* know<br/>\n&gt; better! Children are quite capable of knowing what they want. It&#39;s our<br/>\n&gt; responsibility as unschooling parents to help get them where they want to<br/>\nbe---to reach<br/>\n&gt; those dreams and desires.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think too many people DON&#39;T understand that a really good way to *do*<br/>\nthis<br/>\n&gt; is to model that very behavior. A mom and dad who rush the children to<br/>\nschool,<br/>\n&gt;  go off to work, yell at the kids to get their homework done, send the<br/>\nkids<br/>\n&gt; to bed, and then spend the evening watching tv while the children are in<br/>\nbed<br/>\n&gt; are hardly the role models for learning and pursuing dreams.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; My boys see me and my husband pursuing all sorts of new ventures DAILY.<br/>\nThey<br/>\n&gt; can&#39;t help it---we&#39;re all slammed together. Sometimes they have to wait<br/>\nwhile<br/>\n&gt; I finish what I&#39;m doing. Often they help me. More often *I* wait while<br/>\nTHEY<br/>\n&gt; finish what they&#39;re doing. Often I help them.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I think Type A&#39;s make GREAT unschoolers. There have been people that have<br/>\n&gt; come on this list complaining that they are too laid back to unschool<br/>\n(type Bs).<br/>\n&gt; *I* (the type A) tend to think that *that&#39;s* a bigger hindrance to<br/>\nunschooling<br/>\n&gt; than a real go-getter. But I think that if you understand unschooling (and<br/>\n&gt; the lifestyle), you can certainly unschool whether you&#39;re ABCD or E!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; If she *wants* to unschool, she can. If she doesn&#39;t, she won&#39;t be able to.<br/>\n&gt; She sounds like someone who could really inspire her children. Maybe your<br/>\n&quot;A<br/>\n&gt; daughter&quot; could hang out with her more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; She&#39;d have to get used to less money. More joy, but less money. It&#39;s<br/>\ndoable! &lt;<br/>\n&gt; g&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; ~Kelly<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

Then <br/>\nfor the last two nights Aislinn, 7, has developed a sharp back pain just <br/>\nas all this is going on.  It miraculously goes away if I lay with her. <br/>\n So obviously they all want me and I&#39;m so torn about what to do.  All <br/>\nthis is with no set schedule for bedtime either.  My sister says they <br/>\nare desperate for a set, scheduled bedtime and that is why they are <br/>\nmanipulating me so much.  I think they want attention.  It&#39;s just that <br/>\nI&#39;m with them all day and I look forward to some time alone at night and <br/>\nlately, by the time I go through this with all of them it&#39;s SO late and <br/>\nI&#39;m exhausted.   Well, I&#39;ll try anything to get this going smoothly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your advice.

(I don&#39;t make the money anymore either.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTell her that she&#39;s the type who&#39;d be putting on conferences! <br/>\n<br/>\nI tiled my kitchen counter & backsplash yesterday! Grouting today.<br/>\nI&#39;m a gardening FOOL!<br/>\nI want BEES!<br/>\nI train and groom and show dogs.<br/>\nI love to cook (can&#39;t with the sink and range and oven out though!!!)<br/>\nI&#39;m pulling the upstairs bathtub out and getting a whole new bathroom when <br/>\nI&#39;m done with the kitchen! <br/>\nI&#39;m leaving in a week to take my son to camp in PA, then visiting friends in <br/>\nNY for a few days.<br/>\nBrenda&#39;s coming from Germany to stay for two weeks.<br/>\nAnd all this as I&#39;m pulling together the conference! Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, Unschooling is following your dreams and your desires. *Some* of mine <br/>\nare listed above. There are others....many others! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\nThis lifestyle isn&#39;t *just* about my children. It&#39;s about me and my husband <br/>\nand you and yours and ---it&#39;s about truly understanding that learning happens <br/>\nall the time, no matter how old or young you are.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur unschooling children need us to facilitate---to make it easy for them to <br/>\nreach *their* dreams and goals, big ones and little ones. Adults that <br/>\nunderstand this (and know that many do NOT!), go out and get what they want. Some of <br/>\nthose very adults believe that children are incapable of this. *WE* know <br/>\nbetter! Children are quite capable of knowing what they want. It&#39;s our <br/>\nresponsibility as unschooling parents to help get them where they want to be---to reach <br/>\nthose dreams and desires. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think too many people DON&#39;T understand that a really good way to *do* this <br/>\nis to model that very behavior. A mom and dad who rush the children to school, <br/>\n go off to work, yell at the kids to get their homework done, send the kids <br/>\nto bed, and then spend the evening watching tv while the children are in bed <br/>\nare hardly the role models for learning and pursuing dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys see me and my husband pursuing all sorts of new ventures DAILY. They <br/>\ncan&#39;t help it---we&#39;re all slammed together. Sometimes they have to wait while <br/>\nI finish what I&#39;m doing. Often they help me. More often *I* wait while THEY <br/>\nfinish what they&#39;re doing. Often I help them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Type A&#39;s make GREAT unschoolers. There have been people that have <br/>\ncome on this list complaining that they are too laid back to unschool (type Bs). <br/>\n*I* (the type A) tend to think that *that&#39;s* a bigger hindrance to unschooling <br/>\nthan a real go-getter. But I think that if you understand unschooling (and <br/>\nthe lifestyle), you can certainly unschool whether you&#39;re ABCD or E!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she *wants* to unschool, she can. If she doesn&#39;t, she won&#39;t be able to. <br/>\nShe sounds like someone who could really inspire her children. Maybe your &quot;A <br/>\ndaughter&quot; could hang out with her more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe&#39;d have to get used to less money. More joy, but less money. It&#39;s doable! &lt;<br/>\ng&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n~Kelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":142809109,"authorName":"BADOLBILZ","from":"BADOLBILZ &lt;ynxn96@...&gt;","profile":"thedollymama2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] personality and unschooling","postDate":"1053605780","msgId":14595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDNFQ0NCRjk0LjgwMTAzMDhAZnJvbnRpZXJuZXQubmV0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDE5ZC4xNTQxYTFlOC4yYmZkYmFkNUBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":14593,"nextInTopic":14596,"prevInTime":14594,"nextInTime":14596,"topicId":14585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

She raised a lot of food for thought in a <br/>\npurely discussional, &quot;look at all the angles&quot; way.  And she really <br/>\nlistened.  She wants to read the books I&#39;ve bought, too.  I&#39;m so eager <br/>\nto share them with someone else.  But she did come up with a good <br/>\nquestion that I&#39;d like to ask all of you.  It has to do with how <br/>\ndifferent personality types could unschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am a very type b personality (yes, I really do hate typecasting, but <br/>\nit fits me mostly).  I hate to rush, I&#39;ve always been very creative, <br/>\nartistic, yada yada yada.  That&#39;s me.  She is type a, hyper, has taken <br/>\nProzac to calm down, huge career-woman, thrives on schedules and <br/>\npredictability.  That&#39;s her.  She makes lots of money.  I make none. <br/>\n So...I come across unschooling and decide it&#39;s the best thing since <br/>\nsliced bread and jump off the high board.  It suits me so much.  It <br/>\nmakes sense to me.  She&#39;s wondering how someone like her could unschool <br/>\nsuccessfully.  Is it possible?  She says it&#39;s fascinating, but someone <br/>\nlike her just couldn&#39;t do it.  What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother part to this question is this...I have four dd&#39;s.  It is <br/>\nstarting to become apparent that my second (who shares a birthday with <br/>\nmy sister) is also someone who needs predictability and order.  In fact <br/>\nthese last 6 months of unschooling completely have caused her to become <br/>\nmore and more insecure with many, many fits of clinging and crying. <br/>\n She&#39;s 5, by the way.  The oldest dd and the 3rd dd are taking things <br/>\nright in stride.  4th - only 6 mnths, so she&#39;s cool with it.  Anyway, <br/>\nany suggestions on how to work this so everyone&#39;s getting what they <br/>\nneed?  How can I have a daily routine and schedule for one child and not <br/>\nthe others, too?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last question...my sister said a friend who&#39;d worked in social <br/>\nservices for many years told her that if I&#39;m not careful, &quot;they&quot; could <br/>\ntake my kids away from me and file a criminal report against me for <br/>\nchild neglect if it is decided that my children aren&#39;t up to par with <br/>\n&quot;the norm.&quot;  I&#39;d like to think this is just a scare tactic to keep <br/>\npeople like us in line with the rest.  But could this happen?  Do any of <br/>\nyou know anyone this has happened to?  To be honest, it did scare me. <br/>\n Not enough to stop, but enough to pause and ask all of you anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I&#39;d appreciate it if you all would let me know what you think. <br/>\n Have a GREAT day tomorrow...or later today, I guess.  Perhaps it&#39;s time <br/>\nI got some sleep.   Night.  HeidiC.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14751,"nextTopicId":14744}}
