Her homeschooling experienced ended up being three years of her teaching herself out of ace books while I raced around after her toddler brother. We took her out of junior high because of behavior towards her that was unacceptable and she was really excited about it. I was, too and bought a bunch of stuff we never got to because I didnt know how to do it with a high spirited little one around<br/>\n     I think talking to her and apologizing is a wonderful idea. I remember a few months ago telling her how bad I felt about an inciident when she was younger. I told I was sorry that  I had hurt her and she threw her arms around me for a very long, overdue hug. I like to hug her but she&#39;s usually put off by it. If she hugs me first I know something is right between us.

Sorry for that. I have another scenario for you. An eight year old boy is being unschooled for the first time and loving it. His mother is doing her best but gets frustrated at his seeming lack of motivation to do anything but play video games or play gorilla/Bigfoot with his mom. Enter the nineteen year old college freshman who&#39;s majoring in early childhood education. Her HOMESCHOOL experience was awful. Now she constantly points out why unschooling can&#39;t work in front of her brother and says out loud that he&#39;s behind kindergartenera she&#39;s worked with. She has quite a temper with the boy and the mom and any conversation seems to turn into a battle that leaves us both screaming. (yeah it&#39;s me, like you couldn&#39;t tell). How do suggest a way to break through to the daughter that won&#39;t put her on the defensive?

That&#39;s one of the most degrading things I&#39;ve ever heard of for a child. A cat, maybe, but a kid? We all talk a lot about respecting our children on this board and that just doesn&#39;t fit. In fact, I think you&#39;re the one who said something about not treating your children any differently than your adult peers, as far as respect I mean. Would you use a spray bottle on your husband if he did or said something annoying? What about the checkout lady at the grocery store who&#39;s terribly slow at ringing up your items....do you spray her, too? I&#39;m sorry I know you won&#39;t take this well but I had to say something it just shocked me so much that you would suggest it. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=-Jude will start to get physically in their face; more loud and playfully roll at them.

It&#39;s easier for us, since he has no siblings to torment, but it&#39;s still hard when he does it to other peoples children, and some of his friends (understandably) get very annoyed with him doing it.  It seems to me he just loves the contact and interaction, and craves physical interactions such as wrestling, so it&#39;s like he&#39;s baiting his friends to get them to wrestle or play-fight with him. He full-on wrestles every night with his Dad and that seems to help a bit - does Jude wrestle with his Dad or another adult male?<br/>\n <br/>\nI tell him to STOP (loudly - i&#39;ll admit I often have to yell to get through!), that the other person is not having fun, but like Jude he sometimes seems unable to stop, so I&#39;ll try to distract him, lead him off to another part of the playground, or if we are at someone&#39;s house - sometimes we&#39;ll have to go home.

The other two find this annoying, and quickly the game turns into &#39;STOP, Jude!&#39;.  He doesn&#39;t.  He will continue to jump, roll, be in their personal space and get even louder.  This often escalates into agression and upset by both/either Mia or Rueben (depending on which one has been targeted).  Mia will lose her temper, and often hit in frustration.  Jude still is giggling away, playing, until he actually gets hurt.  When he gets hurt, he then lashes out, both physcially and verbally.  It then becomes a battle of who gets the last word, rude gesture, etc, and tempers flare.  Mia gets Really frustrated, because she Wants to play with him at times, but doesn&#39;t want the rough and tumble aspect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am almost Always present.  I take part in the silly word/voice game with them; I See Jude get more energetic and in their face.  I&#39;ll say things like, &#39;settle down mate, she&#39;s not liking that,&#39; but it&#39;s like he gets in overdrive and doesn&#39;t want to hear me.  I may as well Not be there, because my intervention is ignored.  I physically have to pick him up and hold him to both protect himself and the other sibling from physical hurt.  He Hates this.  I don&#39;t like restraining him either.  For a little guy, he&#39;s strong!  How do I get him to stop?  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he is in a calm mood, I talk to him about his Need to stop when asked to.  That it is game over when Mia/Rueben ask him to stop.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe Often go out most days, as I understand he Needs the external stimulation; to be taken Out of his familiar environment.  But often we Want to stay home and enjoy what is Here.  We have a trampoline, slide, hanging ladder rope and Huge swing out back.  Out the back gate we have a footy oval, BMX track, small tree thickets, and a p/ground.  There is Loads to do right here, and I am with him/them every step of the way.  I don&#39;t know what more to offer him.  I thought perhaps he could Do something physical in the lounge that doesn&#39;t involve throwing/rolling himself into his siblings.  He has a Big exercise ball which he balances/play on, but he ends up rolling That into them!  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my response to all this has Not been all that good of late.  I&#39;m so uptight; anticipating the inevitable.  Mia is miserable at times, because she just wants to Chill.  She has the right to, and I feel for her.  Her resentment and anger continue to grow, as she just wants him to Stop when asked to.  Rueben will Scream at Jude whenever he does the slightest thing he doesn&#39;t like.  He learnt very quickly that his words will not be heard.  I feel I have exhausted all my options to make life Better for them all.  I don&#39;t know how to accomodate their needs in this regard, and I&#39;m tired of continually being &#39;on&#39;.  I&#39;m stressed out!!  Help!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66412,"nextTopicId":66467}}
