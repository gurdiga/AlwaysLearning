Any advice is greatly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad you asked! Frankly (since you asked), I don&#39;t think your <br/>\ndaughters are the problem! I think it&#39;s your boyfriend. Apart from <br/>\nall the extremely complex issues that your very young daughters are <br/>\nhaving to go through regarding grieving for their father and now <br/>\nhaving to live with and submit to the rules & regs of someone whom <br/>\nthey probably did not choose, it would be far better if your <br/>\nboyfriend understood that *he* is setting the girls up to &quot;disobey&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than tell them &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t do that,&quot; perhaps he <br/>\ncan be encouraged to use his experience and intellect to find ways of <br/>\nhelping them do what they seem to want to do! For example, since <br/>\nthey like *that* hill, get a couple of bales of hay or some other <br/>\nkind of soft barrier so they won&#39;t get hurt if they go too <br/>\nfar. Showing them a &quot;better&quot; hill is not the same as helping them do <br/>\nwhat they want to do (although he could show them other hills, too, <br/>\nbut not instead of that one). If he finds ways of saying &quot;yes,&quot; he <br/>\nwill be supportive rather than undermining, and everyone (including <br/>\nhim) will be happier! Saying &quot;no&quot; only encourages them to go <br/>\nunderground and get sneaky, which is a horrible dynamic and sets <br/>\nthings on a path of extreme yuckiness where it&#39;s *us against <br/>\nthem*. That kind of thing will totally undermine unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, my gut is telling me (and I could, of course, be completely <br/>\nwrong) that he may be annoyed that they&#39;re &quot;getting away&quot; with stuff <br/>\nthat *he* couldn&#39;t when he was a wee one. My gut tells me that he&#39;s <br/>\nkind of chomping at the bit to punish, and that&#39;s why he setting them <br/>\nup with arbitrary restrictions that they *will* break so that he can <br/>\npunish them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion (since you asked) :-) would be to examine each one of <br/>\nthe *issues* that your boyfriend is having with what your girls are <br/>\ndoing that bug him, and find out *how* they can still do what *they* <br/>\nwant to do so that they are safe and happy and encouraged and feeling loved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if it were me (and, of course, it&#39;s not, but you *did* ask!), I <br/>\nwould let my boyfriend know unequivocally and in no uncertain terms <br/>\nthat disciplining *my* kids was not part of *his* job description, <br/>\nand hands off! If he wanted to understand unschooling better, I&#39;d be <br/>\nhappy to give him resources so he could get up to speed with my <br/>\nparenting philosophies, but he would also be hearing from me that <br/>\nuntil he understands what I&#39;m doing and why, his input is not <br/>\nwelcome! I wouldn&#39;t give a @#$% what worked for him when he was <br/>\nlittle because he&#39;s not them, you&#39;re not his mom, and they&#39;re not <br/>\nliving in the same circumstances that *he* did! (You might consider <br/>\nfiguring out a gentler way to say that to him then I just did, but <br/>\nI&#39;d keep the 2x4 handy, just in case!) ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji, puttin&#39; up her dukes!<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n         <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All you have to decide is what to do with the time you have been given.&quot; Gandalf<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?

It concerned me to<br/>\nsee the adversarial relationship being created between us.  It really<br/>\nmade an impact on me when I discover one son trying to distract me while<br/>\nmy other son hovered in a corner of the garage gulping down the Capri<br/>\nSun he had smuggled from the fridge.

I<br/>\ndecided right then to go from rules to principles! <br/>\n<br/>\nThat was almost two years ago and I had a wonderful conversation with my<br/>\n8 year old about lying the other day that confirms we are on the right<br/>\npath.  He asked me if I ever lied.  I say that of course I&#39;ve lied.  He<br/>\nasked why.  I said that whenever I lie, it&#39;s usually because I&#39;m afraid<br/>\nthat the person I&#39;m lying to will not love me anymore if they knew the<br/>\ntruth.  I said that I really try hard not to lie and if I ever feel the<br/>\ndesire I remember that I&#39;m lovable anyway and I don&#39;t have to hide my<br/>\nmistakes.  (I wasn&#39;t saying this in a preachy kind of way, hoping he&#39;d<br/>\nget it. It was just a conversation and the sincere truth for me.)

I think it&#39;s your boyfriend.  Apart from <br/>\nall the extremely complex issues that your very young daughters are <br/>\nhaving to go through regarding grieving for their father and now <br/>\nhaving to live with and submit to the  rules & regs of someone whom <br/>\nthey probably did not choose, it would be far better if your <br/>\nboyfriend understood that *he* is setting the girls up to &quot;disobey&quot; him.<br/>\n<br/>\nRather than tell them &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t do that,&quot; perhaps he <br/>\ncan be encouraged to use his experience and intellect to find ways of <br/>\nhelping them do what they seem to want to do!  For example, since <br/>\nthey like *that* hill, get a couple of bales of hay or some other <br/>\nkind of soft barrier so they won&#39;t get hurt if they go too <br/>\nfar.  Showing them a &quot;better&quot; hill is not the same as helping them do <br/>\nwhat they want to do (although he could show them other hills, too, <br/>\nbut not instead of that one).  If he finds ways of saying &quot;yes,&quot; he <br/>\nwill be supportive rather than undermining, and everyone (including <br/>\nhim) will be happier!  Saying &quot;no&quot; only encourages them to go <br/>\nunderground and get sneaky, which is a horrible dynamic and sets <br/>\nthings on a path of extreme yuckiness where it&#39;s *us against <br/>\nthem*.  That kind of thing will totally undermine unschooling!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, my gut is telling me (and I could, of course, be completely <br/>\nwrong) that he may be annoyed that they&#39;re &quot;getting away&quot; with stuff <br/>\nthat *he* couldn&#39;t when he was a wee one.  My gut tells me that he&#39;s <br/>\nkind of chomping at the bit to punish, and that&#39;s why he setting them <br/>\nup with arbitrary restrictions that they *will* break so that he can <br/>\npunish them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion (since you asked) :-) would be to examine each one of <br/>\nthe *issues* that your boyfriend is having with what your girls are <br/>\ndoing that bug him, and find out *how* they can still do what *they* <br/>\nwant to do so that they are safe and happy and encouraged and feeling loved.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, if it were me (and, of course, it&#39;s not, but you *did* ask!), I <br/>\nwould let my boyfriend know unequivocally and in no uncertain terms <br/>\nthat disciplining *my* kids was not part of *his* job description, <br/>\nand hands off!  If he wanted to understand unschooling better, I&#39;d be <br/>\nhappy to give him resources so he could get up to speed with my <br/>\nparenting philosophies, but he would also be hearing from me that <br/>\nuntil he understands what I&#39;m doing and why, his input is not <br/>\nwelcome!  I wouldn&#39;t give a @#$% what worked for him when he was <br/>\nlittle because he&#39;s not them, you&#39;re not his mom, and they&#39;re not <br/>\nliving in the same circumstances that *he* did!  (You might consider <br/>\nfiguring out a gentler way to say that to him then I just did, but <br/>\nI&#39;d keep the 2x4 handy, just in case!)  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps!!<br/>\n<br/>\nMarji, puttin&#39; up her dukes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283675851,"authorName":"Vida","from":"Vida &lt;vidamel@...&gt;","profile":"baubogria","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need advice","postDate":"1170407025","msgId":27910,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYwMkM3MjhBLTNFNkItNDNGMy1CMDY0LTExQzY3OTM1NzRFNkBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIyNjQ0OS42OTMzMy5xbUB3ZWIzMTgxMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDIyNjQ0OS42OTMzMy5xbUB3ZWIzMTgxMi5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":27909,"nextInTopic":27911,"prevInTime":27909,"nextInTime":27911,"topicId":27906,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Chrissie, I have the same question.

What I can say is that punishment  <br/>\ndoes NOT work. I made the mistake of trying it.... and not the time  <br/>\nout type or go to your room, or threats of no TV etc..... I just  <br/>\nstarted yelling at her and the more I let myself do that, the worse  <br/>\nit got.... I can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if I locked her  <br/>\nin her room without supper.  The results have accumulated over 2  <br/>\nyears and the only thing I have accomplished is to make her afraid of  <br/>\nme, to make her feel she needs to lie, to push her away so that she  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t talk to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, please do not resort to punishment...... please don&#39;t do that  <br/>\nto them.

Their father passed away in May after being sick since March.  We have started putting our lives back together and moved into a new house in a different town.  We have lived here two months. My boyfriend has lived with us almost 3 yrs now.  We lived with their father until he passed away.  Recently they have started doing things my boyfriend asks them not too, especially my 10 yro daughter.  This does not happen to me.  Little things, but it is bothering him enough our house is starting to get really uncomfortable. We do not punish them, but talk.  I have given him different things to read about unschooling and peaceful parenting.  He feels like when they do these little things they are lying to him because they tell him they understand what he is saying and then do it anyway.  Here is an example of what happens; He asked them not to slide down the hill by our house when it was icy,<br/>\n because he didn&#39;t want them hitting the house.  When they did it anyway he explained that he didn&#39;t want them to get hurt and if they would have told him it was the best hill they could find, he would have showed them an even better one that didn&#39;t run into the house.  After something like this happens, he gets really upset.  This keeps happening and I cannot figure out what we are doing wrong.  It is interfering with our unschooling and making our home feel divided.  We used to do everything as a family.  Has this ever happened to anyone before and what can him or I do to communicate properly with the children?  He wants to start punishing them because it worked with him and I feel like that would make it worse.  Any advice is greatly appreciated. <br/>\n   <br/>\n  Thank you,<br/>\n  Chrissie <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;All you have to decide is what to do with the time you have been given.&quot; Gandalf<br/>\n __________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nTired of spam?
