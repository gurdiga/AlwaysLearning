He was on a troop ship  <br/>\non the way to Germany when the war ended in Europe.  I don&#39;t think he  <br/>\never rode a train, but on my mother&#39;s side, one of her uncles died  <br/>\njumping off a train in the early 30&#39;s (I think).  He broke his neck.   <br/>\nThey used to say he was probably pushed.  So the whole thing creeps  <br/>\nme out, but Holly LOVES that period.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could sing them some tearjerker ballads.  &quot;The Little Paper Boy,&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;Put my Little Shoes Away,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure I could get through  <br/>\nthem without crying.  That second one I learned from my mom and I  <br/>\nalways hear it in her voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSAD, sad, sad times. And on top of the financial disasters and the  <br/>\ndust bowl, there were contagious fevers everywhere, and farm  <br/>\ninjuries, and...
