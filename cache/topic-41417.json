She loved the recent Doctor Who when they met <br/>\nAgathe Christie (based on a real event in her life apparently). We have <br/>\nmany, many ND and Poirot mystery games and other Wii mystery games.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn makes up mystery stories using her dolls and the characters - with <br/>\nspecial clothes that say &quot;detective&quot; to her. Here&#39;s the thing - the made up <br/>\nmysteries don&#39;t have to have the complexity or super fab logic of Agatha <br/>\nChristie. I have found that it&#39;s ok to just play investigation without <br/>\nworrying about actually catching the crook, or for every clue to line up in <br/>\nthe end.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn&#39;s scenarios - a theft at an art museum, where the thieves took a <br/>\npainting out the skylight. Another - her doll is a detective with an alter <br/>\nego/disguise (so doll play with clothing) investigating a murder in a Paris <br/>\nhotel. Another - the theft of fashion designs (which she drew) from a <br/>\ndesigner&#39;s atelier. The only one that has reached the point of being solved <br/>\nafter many hours of doll play is the Parisian murder. Sometimes my job is to <br/>\nbe characters in the game, others to take notes of the story for later <br/>\nrewriting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother game might be a scavenger hunt or a hunt with a series of clues <br/>\nhidden in your house and yard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.
