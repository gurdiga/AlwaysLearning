It&#39;s their personality or they&#39;re younger and <br/>\nmore trusting (read *not yet jaded*) of parents&#39; ideas about when they <br/>\nshould sleep.  Karl can be outmaneuvered into sleeping before he wants <br/>\nto.  It&#39;s happened here a number of times.  So I know it can be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, now that Karl is getting older, all this is getting harder and <br/>\nharder to *make* happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time Karl got old enough to start balking and wanted to control <br/>\nwhen sleep happens, I&#39;m finding that trying to control Karl is just <br/>\nresulting in him not wanting to hear what *we* want at other times.  <br/>\nThat kind of thing has a ripple effect.  Once the trust in your child <br/>\ntakes a hit somewhere, it&#39;s easy to blame the kid and from there things <br/>\nspiral down more and more quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelping Karl to relax and finding ways to welcome sleep has never been <br/>\nturned down unless it&#39;s put with our *need* for him get to sleep *now <br/>\nor very soon please.*  Then anything we do can backfire and appear <br/>\nmanipulative to him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutright taking the choice about when the TV goes off can mess things <br/>\nup.

She was in the middle of watching something. <br/>\nIf mom came in and switched off dad&#39;s tv show like that, with what is <br/>\nessentially no warning, wouldn&#39;t it be reasonable for him to complain? Just <br/>\nwalking in suddenly and switching off the tv in the middle of another <br/>\nperson&#39;s show isn&#39;t an issue of deciding someone else was tired for them; it <br/>\nwas a little piece of disrespectful rudeness that the offended person was <br/>\nprotesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have posted many times about how in Jayn&#39;s case all the turning off of <br/>\nlights and quietness and calm atmosphere in the world won&#39;t put her to sleep <br/>\nbefore she is truly ready. It&#39;s all very well to say that a child is &quot;too <br/>\nyoung&quot; to be awake, but if she is anything like Jayn was ever since she grew <br/>\nfrom infancy, there is NO WAY to make her not be awake when she is not <br/>\nsleepy. And we have been in situations where she has fought the soporific <br/>\neffects of big drugs (medical situations) and in one case won! That is <br/>\ndifferent from helping her be quiet and considerate of others while awake <br/>\nlate at night.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe little girl probably shouldn&#39;t be &quot;screaming&quot;, but that will come with <br/>\ndevelopment and being encouraged to express herself differently. What does <br/>\n&quot;screaming&quot; mean in this case anyway? Bursting into tears and crying? Does <br/>\nher crying carry beyond the walls of the room? Maybe it really was a scream <br/>\nof outrage. Helping her find other ways to express herself is a separate <br/>\nissue from gentle to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we have no way of knowing today is whether Marisol would have fallen <br/>\nasleep within five minutes anyway. In Jayn&#39;s case experience leads me to <br/>\nbelieve that yes, she would have. She sleeps when she is ready to sleep, <br/>\nregardless of what is on the tv.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeliberately doing something that will upset and outrage a tired child, such <br/>\nas walk in and switch off her show, is not going to help anyone be calm. I <br/>\nthink they are lucky Marisol fell asleep so quickly. Jayn would probably <br/>\nhave cried in anger for fifteen minutes, and I would have taken her to the <br/>\nother room for it, and she and I would have been kept up even longer. Dh <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t do that kind of disrespectful thing to Jayn. It was a mistake borne <br/>\nof frustration I&#39;m guessing - but your dh can forgive himself for it and <br/>\nresolve not to do that again. And you can work together to change the <br/>\nsituation so he doesn&#39;t feel called to act that way again to meet his own <br/>\nneeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving been in this kind of situation about tv sharing and tv in the bedroom <br/>\nmy advice is this:<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure Marisol understands that the first priority has to be Daddy&#39;s <br/>\nsleep - because he has the schedule, and the morning commitments (assuming <br/>\nthat is so.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to have the tv on, find a volume that works for everyone. <br/>\nI&#39;m lucky because my dh likes the tv on for sleep. It&#39;s like white noise to <br/>\nhim. In fact I think that he finds it easier to fall asleep with sound - he <br/>\neven has a speaker device under his pillow so that he can listen to his <br/>\ninternet radio to go to sleep to. I now use earplugs to sleep, although I <br/>\nprobably would not have done so when Jayn was little even if I had thought <br/>\nof it at the time. We have had lots of times when Jayn has sat at the end of <br/>\nthe bed to be able to hear the lower volume, and then she crawls back to us <br/>\nwhen ready to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalk to your dh about how this might go differently next time. If he needs <br/>\nthe bedroom to be quiet for his sleep, perhaps you need a different <br/>\narrangement for your late night watching. Jayn and I pretty much own the tv <br/>\nin the living room, while dh uses the bedroom tv. We dvr in the living room, <br/>\nhe has his shows on the bedroom satellite. It works out very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if you only have the one tv with vcr, make a plan to warn Marisol in <br/>\nfuture. Say that you will be able to watch until Daddy comes in, or work out <br/>\na &quot;five more minutes&quot; or &quot;until such and such a scene&quot;. Ask your dh to give <br/>\nyou a five minute warning before he is coming in to bed, or make an habit of <br/>\nwinding down the watching while he does some regular thing - like from the <br/>\nmoment he brushes his teeth. Model the negotiations for daddy also so he <br/>\nhears you saying &quot;Here comes Daddy to go to sleep. We need to turn the show <br/>\noff in a moment. What is a good place to pause until tomorrow?&quot; If Jayn were <br/>\nunwilling and getting loud about it, I would take that as a &quot;not ready for <br/>\nsleep&quot; sign and take her to the living room to give dh the bed. Maybe your <br/>\ndh would be willing to try earplugs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s how we have gone to sleep over the last few nights. Assume dh is in <br/>\nthe bedroom, drifitng between watching tv, working on his laptop, listening <br/>\nto his internet radio, reading and sleeping, as he does every evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night I was very tired and warned Jayn that I needed to go to bed. She <br/>\ntold me she wanted me to stay up, but I repeated that I was very tired. She <br/>\ntold me that she was hungry and I offered her the three or four choices of <br/>\nwhat I was prepared to make at 3am. She was thinking over her choices while <br/>\nI went and put on my pyjamas, in the bathroom. I also turned dh&#39;s light off <br/>\nsince he was really fully asleep by now. I fixed Jayn the food she wanted, <br/>\ngave it to her and went to the bedroom to wait and glanced at a book. Within <br/>\nabout five minutes she came in. I went to the living room and put out the <br/>\nlights. Jayn changed the tv channels to the one she was watching - low <br/>\nvolume. She was asleep within moments of lying down, despite asserting that <br/>\nshe wasn&#39;t tired (that&#39;s just static - I let that kind of statement go by as <br/>\ncode for &quot;I wish I wasn&#39;t tired&quot;). And then I turned off the tv and had to <br/>\ninsert my earplugs against a cacophany of snoring from two people who both <br/>\nhave a cold!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe night before I was doing some writing on my computer situated behind the <br/>\nsofa where Jayn sat and watched a couple of dvd movies in the living room, <br/>\nand having her snack. At one point she got up - I thought she had gone to <br/>\nthe bathroom. The movie ended and I realized that she had not come back - so <br/>\nI thought she was in the bed. It was about 2.30am. I put out the lights, <br/>\nturned off the electronics. I went to the bathroom to put on my pyjamas (you <br/>\nwill see by now that this is where I keep them to avoid disturbing dh with <br/>\nclothes changing noises) then I tiptoed in to the bedroom which unusually <br/>\nwas pitch black with the tv already off. Did I find Jayn in bed? No. Without <br/>\nmy noticing it she had gone to play in the little alcove we made out of a <br/>\nshelving unit and the hall closet where most of her toys are stored. She can <br/>\nstill see and hear the tv from there. She&#39;d fallen asleep on the floor. So I <br/>\nwalked her to the bedroom, with some difficulty in getting her on to her <br/>\nfeet. I&#39;d have left her there if the floor weren&#39;t so hard and cold.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe night before had been similar, only this time she had annonced that she <br/>\nwas going to bed and gone to the bedroom to join James watching something or <br/>\nother of his. When I came in within about half an hour she was asleep <br/>\nsnuggled up to him and he was asleep with his computer on his chest and all <br/>\nthe lights on, which I took care of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m mentioning all of this to show that in our house going to sleep looks <br/>\ndifferent every night. Sometimes I go to bed first and dh is the one who <br/>\ngets up and switches off the lights and electronics in the living room. <br/>\nSometimes Jayn falls asleep on the sofa. Sometimes I take a nap there, and <br/>\nshe likes to wake me up and make me scrambled eggs in the middle of the <br/>\nnight. Jayn will get hungry at odd times, and sometimes it is suddenly and I <br/>\nam in the kitchen just when I would like to be in the bed. The natural limit <br/>\nhere becomes what I am willing to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut through it all, dh gets his sleep for work. If he is staying awake, it&#39;s <br/>\nhis own decision, and he usually doesn&#39;t hear us come in. I think he would <br/>\nlike to spend more time with us in the evening, but that desire is at odds <br/>\nwith his own tendency to nap and snooze regardless of where he is <br/>\ncomfortably settled, and conflicting tastes in tv preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only time that there has been conflict over sleep is if I or dh were <br/>\ntrying to force Jayn to go to sleep before she was ready or when she was <br/>\nstill hungry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

You made more morning!! I have had yet another aha moment this morning that was spurred by an incident last night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have repeatedly asked about sleep issues here. My daughter is almost 3 and has challenged me from the start. I have pretty much always followed her lead, but have struggled internally with what is &quot;right&quot; and what my decisions are based on. <br/>\n<br/>\nLast night it was almost midnight and yet again my little girl was still awake -- and this time without a nap! It seems that once she makes it over a certain hump she has the ability to go for a long time. I think she is like a sleep camel! I am pretty sure that she was overtired too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe did get into bed, had dim lighting, told stories and nursed a couple of times. But no sleep. So she wanted to watch a video (Care Bears!) I was tired, but it was fine and I was relaxing reading a book. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband came in and decided it was &quot;Time for bed!&quot; Turned off the TV. Marisol was SO upset. Crying and screaming, and told us EXACTLY what she wanted. &quot;The show isn&#39;t over! I want to watch it!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was very angry. I felt that we were happy and not bothering anyone (my husband!) and I much prefer it when she goes to sleep peacefully. Yet I still had a nagging sensation that he was &quot;right&quot; in some ways. She was clearly TIRED -- went to sleep after only 5 minutes! And the &quot;mainstream parenting voice&quot; in my head thought she SHOULD be asleep, am I doing her a disservice? DH also mentioned that she hardly has &quot;any boundaries&quot; as justification for sometimes &quot;laying down the law&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis morning I woke up early and hungry (I am 6 months pregnant!)And once I am awake my mind is ready to go. So I am lying there thinking. And wondering if I should post my questions/thoughts here... but suddenly I am able to work through it on my own -- and it really makes sense! And I feel totally ready to talk about it with my husband! Not confrontational at all -- just calm and happy. And I do totally understand his point of view and know that he has no idea where I am coming from because he is not the one reading all this. He has just been awesome at following my lead and letting me do things the way I want, but sometimes (like he last 2 weeks of business school!) he just reaches a breaking point. It is time to discuss some things with him -- not even as &quot;Unschooling&quot; but as a life and parenting philosphy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wanted to share my thoughts this morning -- I made a little outline on Word and it is much shorter than this post I swear! I think it will help me explain things and also help me when I am not sure what the &quot;right&quot; answer is to how to react to certain things. So here it is:<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts/words/philosophy of Unschooling (how I want to parent regardless of whether my child does to school or not!)<br/>\n<br/>\nKey words:<br/>\n<br/>\nChoice, learning, relationships, joy/happiness, TRUST<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do we really want for our child/ren?<br/>\nTo learn to make good choices<br/>\nTo be happy<br/>\nTo have good relationships<br/>\n<br/>\nMainstream parenting is often about modifying behavior so the child does what YOU want in that moment<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen children are babies â&quot; attachment parenting â&quot; meeting needs â&quot; LISTENING to baby<br/>\nSoâ¦<br/>\nï\tWhen they cry we listen â&quot; nurse, hold, change diaper etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are children learning when we donât listen to them and decide that âwe know bestâ?<br/>\nï\tThat mom and dad arenât listening<br/>\nï\tThat they donât care what I want<br/>\nï\tThat I donât know how to make decisions for myself<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a LIFE philosophy, not just about school or no school. It is NOT the easiest way to parent. The child does NOT always make the ârightâ decision every time, it is a process of learning to trust themselves and US (nurtures our relationship and their learning about themselves and the world).<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought it was pretty good!<br/>\n<br/>\nSusan</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":44503,"nextTopicId":44522}}
