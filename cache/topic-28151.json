Anne Ohman&#39;s <br/>\narticle, &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent,&quot; examines the world-expanding <br/>\nnature of disquiet and restlessness, inviting us to explore and embrace <br/>\nthese feelings as opportunities to learn and grow. Ben Lovejoy details <br/>\nhis ongoing love-affair with music and how sharing that passion with his <br/>\noldest son has made the road to Bonnaroo Music Festival a road home for <br/>\nthem both. Kelly Lovejoy offers sage advice from a place of hind-sight; <br/>\nRobyn Coburn encourages us to celebrate our children&#39;s inherent <br/>\ncreativity; Deb Lewis invites us to consider the importance of <br/>\nconnection and positive thinking; and Ren Allen explores the many ways <br/>\nfamilies share, learn and grow together.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Connections* is pleased to offer such an inspiring line up of articles <br/>\nthis month and excited to announce some upcoming changes in the ezine&#39;s <br/>\nformat as it continues to grow and evolve. As of next month&#39;s issue, <br/>\n*Connections* will be moving to a bimonthly format--every two <br/>\nmonths--allowing us to offer more in each issue, though original <br/>\nsubscribers will still receive the same number of issues for which they <br/>\nsubscribed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;ll be adding a new creative department by Ren Allen, modeled after <br/>\nher &quot;Imagination Tribe&quot; and filled with inspiring ideas, tips, and <br/>\nencouragement for the artist within, as well as adding a &quot;Marketplace&quot; <br/>\nfeature, offering a virtual mall of *unschooling* vendors--contact me to <br/>\nfind out how to list your business in the Marketplace.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps our most exciting news is that we&#39;ll be adding Laurie Chancey to <br/>\nour list of regular columnists as of the June/July issue. Laurie, as <br/>\nmany of you know, is a grown unschooler and the inspiration for her <br/>\nmother&#39;s book, _The Unprocessed Child_. Laurie will muse on her own life <br/>\nas a sociology grad student, her childhood, her future and the world in <br/>\ngeneral in a column titled, &quot;Unprocessed.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this expansion, however, come the inevitable growing pains, and I&#39;m <br/>\nsad to announce that the next issue will be Rue Kream&#39;s last as she <br/>\nleaves us to spend more time with her family. I&#39;ve so enjoyed working <br/>\nwith Rue, and I know many along with me will miss her gentle wisdom and <br/>\nfirm advocacy for children in her &quot;Ask Rue&quot; column. I&#39;ve been honored to <br/>\nhelp Rue&#39;s voice appear more regularly in the unschooling world, and <br/>\nnow, we&#39;ll all just have to bug her--ahem--*encourage her* to write that <br/>\nsecond book!<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all for your support and enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~Danielle<br/>\nEmily (9), Julia (8), Sam (6)<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com\">http://www.organiclearning.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br/>\n<br/>\nConnections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://connections.organiclearning.org\">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28150,"nextTopicId":28106}}
