We see such a width and","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1974139128\">Our problem with unschooling isn&#39;t knowing whether our two children (8 and 10 years old) are learning anything; we know that they are. We see such a width and depth of learning going on and do not want to interfere with that. It&#39;s the interpersonal dynamics that are causing a problem and I am seeking advice for how we can help to create a respectful balance for us all. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have reached a point where everything is fine as long as the children are getting exactly what they want, when they want it. Anything else leads to complaining, whining, and/or pouting. In trying to respect the wishes/desires of all, we rarely go anywhere as an entire family because one child or the other will refuse the invitation as &quot;uninteresting&quot; or interfering with something they&#39;d prefer to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m feeling quite burnt out trying to keep the house clean, the pantry stocked, snacks flowing and laundry clean, while also engaging with the kids in what they&#39;re working on (which is really difficult because my son, 10, rarely comes out of his room other than when he wants food or to complain that food he wants isn&#39;t ready/available). We have placed an extra fridge upstairs and keep it stocked with snacks. We also regularly bring special requests to his room. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do sit with him while gaming at times, but if he&#39;s online with friends he seems to respond as if we&#39;re intruding rather than interested, and most gaming he does is online/Skype. My husband has said that he hates being treated like an &quot;intruder&quot; or an &quot;inconvenience&quot; in his son&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband & I have fallen into this flow of &quot;tag-teaming&quot; so that he&#39;s paired with one child and I&#39;m paired with the other. <br/>\n<br/>\nI did have a little time to myself this morning, but that was because my son refused to go out with all four of us, so my husband took our daughter & I stayed home with our son. Honestly, it wasn&#39;t all that great because I was pretty upset. I understand that he got a new game, but we did ask *when* he&#39;d be willing to go out and he refused to say, other than that he couldn&#39;t tell us because he wanted to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now he&#39;s back to spending the majority of his time alone in his room. Well, until midnight, when he&#39;ll come get my husband, because he refuses to go downstairs by himself and he&#39;s hungry. He wants to look through the downstairs fridge and pantry and then ask everyone else to make things for him and deliver them to his room. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, my daughter is refusing to wear anything except a single pair of blue boxers that are so baggy if she isn&#39;t standing upright, you can see everything.
