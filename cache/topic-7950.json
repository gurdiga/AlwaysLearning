One charge is that I&#39;m racist because I said Arabs are <br/>\nCaucasian.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t think about that too hard; it won&#39;t help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that I don&#39;t like New Yorkers or dads or Republicans.  Racist because of <br/>\nthat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far this morning I have better unschooling stories of what&#39;s happened here <br/>\ntoday than some of them will have by nighttime, and it&#39;s only 11:00 a.m. AND <br/>\nI&#39;ve talked to a pregnant friend in England for over half an hour and have <br/>\ndealt with conference/boycott mail (all of it in my favor).   And it&#39;s going <br/>\nto rain again today!  YES!!!  Droughts don&#39;t end just because of a few rains, <br/>\nbut rain is wonderful after a drought!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy tomatoes are getting ripe and Holly brought one in that fell off in her <br/>\nhand.  I think I&#39;ll go and eat it.  She doesn&#39;t like tomatoes yet.
