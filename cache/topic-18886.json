Cultural<br/>\ndifferences, physical differences and personal<br/>\nprefernaces can make a rule seem nonsensical to you,<br/>\nbut of varying degrees of importance to someone else,<br/>\nperhaps of great importance.  In general I encourage<br/>\nmy children to be good guests by abiding by the rules<br/>\nof their hosts.  If they are onerous rules, I doubt<br/>\nanyone would want to be a guest long, if they choose<br/>\nto be at all.  It&#39;s also important to me to help my<br/>\nchildren learn to be good hosts, who in my opinion,<br/>\ntry to make their guests as comfortable as possible<br/>\nwithin the scope of their lifestyle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe keep a pretty casual social circle, so friends in<br/>\ngeneral are free to question us if they think a<br/>\npractice we have may be strange or a &quot;rule&quot;<br/>\nnonsensical.  More likely it&#39;s our lack of &quot;rules&quot;<br/>\nwhich people question, but one example might be that<br/>\nwe have some dangerous allergies in our home and as a<br/>\nresult we used to ask (when our kids were younger and<br/>\nneeded more oversight) that no one offer food to our<br/>\nkids without letting us know, unless they are very<br/>\ngood friends, well acquainted with their allergies. <br/>\nNow they are old enough to ask people for themselves<br/>\nwhat is in a food and clarify with us if they are not<br/>\nsure if they can eat it without being sick.  We also<br/>\nhad to police the snacks that friends brought to the<br/>\nhouse to a certain degree, asking that they not snack<br/>\non messy nut mixes or eggy pastries for instance,<br/>\nwithout washing their hands well with soap afterwards,<br/>\nor just not eat them in our house at all, if they had<br/>\na tendancy to drop bits on the floor.  We asked that<br/>\nkids at the house for playdates not be allowed to run<br/>\naround with dangerous allergen foods in their hands or<br/>\non their clothes and that they wash up after eating<br/>\nsuch, which we often had to do for the guest kids<br/>\nourselves, as the other parents, not accustomed to<br/>\nthinking about it, would forget to pay attention to<br/>\nit.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving never had a child who has had numerous<br/>\nalaphylactic shock reactions to various foods, merely<br/>\nfrom skin contact in some cases, and very close calls<br/>\nwith agressive ER intervention, like ours, most people<br/>\nthought we were eccentric and anal, to say the least. <br/>\nBut if they had decided that our rules were not<br/>\nreasonable because they could not see the danger or<br/>\nthought we exaggerated it, they didn&#39;t stay guests<br/>\nlong.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;However, if you put a big dish m&ms down in front of<br/>\n&gt;my kids and said &quot;these m&ms are for adults who are<br/>\n&gt;over 50 years old only and no one else may touch<br/>\n&gt;them, I have no reason for that rule, I just do it<br/>\n&gt;because I like to control people&quot;, both my children<br/>\n&gt;and I would probably find some reason to leave rather<br/>\n&gt;quickly and would also probably find a store pretty<br/>\n&gt;quickly to buy our own m&ms.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not a very likely or realistic scenario to back up a<br/>\nposition of reasonable civil disobedience.  Do you<br/>\nhave any more realistic examples from experience?  I<br/>\nalso noticed that you said you would leave and get<br/>\nyour own M&Ms, not that you would disobey the rule set<br/>\nforth and have the kids help themselves regardless<br/>\nwhen their host was not looking, or even that you<br/>\nwould get some for them and hand them over.  So you<br/>\nare still obeying the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Other times we fudge things a bit so they can<br/>\n&gt;participate (like saying Janene is in 1st grade this<br/>\n&gt;year so she can be a Girl Scout Brownie, when she<br/>\n&gt;really would be, if she were in school, a K.  Or<br/>\n&gt;saying Lexie is 9, instead of 8, so she can <br/>\n&gt;participate as a pre-teen at the conference.) <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>What you have described is teaching your children to<br/>\nbe dishonest in order to get what they want, the ends<br/>\njustifying the means.  I&#39;m not attacking you, really<br/>\nJoylyn, I just am curious as to why you think the<br/>\nabove is a better approach than teaching them to<br/>\nstanding up for themselves and openly question the<br/>\nstanding rule, or even refusing to participate in a<br/>\nsituation that excludes or limits them based on false<br/>\nqualifiers like a 1 year age difference.  Why not try<br/>\nto opnely challenge, stretch, change or topple the<br/>\nexisting policy, even if just for your small girl<br/>\nscout troup, rather than use subterfuge?  I would<br/>\nthink it would be a much more usefull experience for<br/>\nthem in the honesty of being true to their principles,<br/>\nthe subtleties of interpersonal politics, group<br/>\nstructures and even legal issues, if age limits are in<br/>\nregards to those, than a lesson in misleading others. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":18898,"nextTopicId":18918}}
