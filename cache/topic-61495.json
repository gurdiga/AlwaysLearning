He&#39;d get wiggly and I was worried about disturbing his dad.<br/>\nIt might be that if you got out of bed he&#39;d want to be up then and wouldn&#39;t go back to sleep.   For us it worked.  The position in the chair was more comfortable for nursing a toddler.  I did sometimes sleep in the chair.   If there&#39;s space in your bedroom for a rocker/recliner by your bed that might be even easier.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize the problem is your lack of sleep, and your anxiety about that, which probably exacerbates the problem.   Maybe if you found a more comfortable way to nurse him at night that could help some until you find a way to stop. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinding some help with your anxiety about lack of sleep might help you relax enough to get a bit more sleep in the intervening time.

He knows you aren&#39;t really happy about his<br/>\nnursing at night, but he needs it and your trying to change his life<br/>\nin a big way. Perhaps his discomfort at being given other calming<br/>\nmethods is what&#39;s making it difficult for him to calm down and sleep<br/>\nand giving you the opportunity to sleep. ---<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s not just a possibility, its completely true.  His needs are real, which is why I&#39;ve nursed him at night this long, although I&#39;ve been getting less and less sleep for a while.  There is a tipping point for some women, though, from what I&#39;ve read on a local Attachment Parenting list.  Many women, at some point, just can&#39;t do it anymore.  At this point, while his need to nurse is huge, my need not to nurse (in my opinion, and I am the one with the &#39;nursies&#39; to decide) is also biological and big, and maybe even bigger, because I also want to be able to treat both kids better during the day and that involves being able to keep my eyes open. I think the benefits to my daytime parenting of both children if I am better-slept outweighs the benefits to him nursing at night (he nurses a lot during the day too, which is ok), although maybe not from his perspective in the middle of the night.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---For him, at two, it&#39;s still a huge part of his life! If he is allowed<br/>\nto stop in his own time (not to say you can&#39;t offer other things, but<br/>\nyou probably will have to find a way to be okay with his needs and not<br/>\nresentful), he might stop nursing earlier if you stop resisting! I<br/>\nremember being done with nursing before my daughter was. When I<br/>\nstarted feeling a bit put-upon, she ramped up her need. I relaxed and<br/>\nbreathed *a lot*. I sorely missed that connection when she weaned<br/>\nherself.---<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know... this advice I hear a lot.  Its good advice.  I&#39;ve seen it work for some women, who&#39;s discomfort or lack of sleep may not be as severe, or who have better capacity to compensate.  I told myself this for a long time with my first one.  And then I saw a documentary about some animals, mammals, and I distinctly remember something clicking in my mind when I saw a mother cow, and her nursling toddler-equivalent cow, and she pushed the baby away when he tried to nurse.  I realized that its a relationship with two sides.  In some human cultures babies have nursed until they wean themselves, in others babies were weaned as toddlers, or younger or older.<br/>\n<br/>\n---The other thing to remember that lack of sleep is always a possibility<br/>\nwith small children. It won&#39;t last forever. It&#39;s sometimes hard to see<br/>\nthat the light at the end of the tunnel isn&#39;t an oncoming train when<br/>\nyou&#39;re in the middle of said tunnel, but things *will* change.---<br/>\n<br/>\nMy LLL Leader friend said this recently when I was asking for advice.  She quoted the study that showed that cosleeping/night-nursing moms had better sleep than those with babies in another bedroom.  Does anyone know if that study included toddlers, or just infants?  I have a feeling (and I&#39;ve seen a lot of frantic mothers post about night-nursing toddlers on my local list) that night-nursing a toddler is just a different ballgame than a baby.  This lack of sleep is completely different from newborn lack of sleep.  With a baby, you wake up, nurse them back to sleep, unlatch (or not) and then fall back into a relatively deep sleep, definitely I would get to REM sleep.  Now I rarely even get that, nevermind that third and fourth stage deep sleep.  When I get a chance for a nap during the day... I can&#39;t even fall asleep deeply if I want to, because of the accumulation and built-in fear of being woken by a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this veered too far away from unschooling discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":251210887,"authorName":"shirarocklin","from":"&quot;shirarocklin&quot; &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt;","profile":"shirarocklin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Weaning Toddlers - Not exactly unschooling specific","postDate":"1307662683","msgId":61514,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGlzcmxncisyMmFvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEU1RUMxMEJDLUU0QTQtNEU4Ny1BNDg5LTgzNEM1Mzk5QkM1NkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":61513,"nextInTopic":61515,"prevInTime":61513,"nextInTime":61515,"topicId":61495,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Nursing became physically unbearable at night... I could weather it during the day, but couldn&#39;t bear it at night.  Its not that its about me - except that it is about me.  The nursing dyad is how I&#39;ve heard LLL leaders refer to the nursing relationship.  Yes his needs are paramount to me, and I definitely was able to cope with the lack of sleep in the baby stage, it was on a different level from this.  Sleeping with a nursing baby is much easier, the latch is different, my hormones are different, there&#39;s milk flowing, it feels good and right.  Nursing a toddler feels good too, but with teeth and a bigger mouth and a toddler&#39;s personality, and scratching or grabbing other body parts, or latching on all night long, its not the same.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd partially, I am thinking ahead, because I am newly pregnant, and it was very torturous for me and my daughter when I decided to end things rather suddenly because I tried to keep the night-nursing going longer than I was really able to comfortably.

I remember feeling the way you describe. I also feel like she is shifting again, just a little. In retrospect, I remember I would nurse her to sleep and she would stay a sleep for most of the night. Then a couple of months after she turned two she started to nurse at night so much that i hardly was getting any sleep. The transition from getting sleep to not getting sleep was really hard and a big shock to my body. I became stressed and resistant to nursing her. The more i didn&#39;t want to nurse I felt the more she wanted me at night. I became inflexible. My thought process was&quot; hey you changed on me, this doesn&#39;t work for me, i liked the way it was before, i feel like we are going backwards, i liked feeling a little freedom and space&quot;. <br/>\nI allowed myself to have my feelings. I also recognized that we just moved to a new state and new house, we were away from their daddy, my partner for two months before moving...Of course i was exhausted, of course she was nursing like crazy. Part of my exhaustion was, I was a single mom for two months. I needed a break, I need some self love, I needed sleep, I needed to hang out with friends. Fill up my well. From doing these things I found my compassion. I didn&#39;t even know I lost it. I lost having compassion for myself. No wonder it was hard finding it for her for this particular situation. She is only two. She is going through really big changes and she finds comfort in sleeping at my breast. How can i not. When i shifted i was so happy to know that I am right there for her, i cuddled her when she nursed and tickled her. Now she actually finds comfort in being tickled as well. So i do both. And she will change again and again and again... We all do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sharing this to make you feel guilty on wanting to wean your ds. I hope you don&#39;t feel that way.  Sleep is such an important thing. You are an amazing mom for nursing, and night nursing so long. We all do the best we can. I hope you can find ways to fill up yourself (finding ways to sleep) so you can feel more grounded about the situation, what ever decision you make. In LLL meetings we would always say this too shall pass. Find support, find other like minded mamas to help along the way.<br/>\nBe gentle with yourself.<br/>\nNatalie<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;shirarocklin&quot; &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi again,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t really an unschooling question... but I am trying to apply unschooling principles to every area of life, so I thought this question could be appropriate here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a 2 year old who I would like to stop nursing at night.

I tried many of the things you have tried and realized they did not work at all. Finally I thought, well, instead of all of these distracting measures, why don&#39;t I just tell her what&#39;s going on. So, for the past 3 weeks when I feel frustrated and not enjoying the night nursing (sometimes it&#39;s fine and I hardly notice but other times it feels excruciatingly annoying!) I will tell her, while she is latched on, &quot;bubbies are all done. Mommy needs to sleep now&quot;. Then I wait. I don&#39;t take her off. If she is still sucking after about 10 seconds I say it again. Usually after the second time she lets go, rolls over and say &quot;nigh-nigh mommy&quot; and is asleep in seconds, and stays asleep for several more hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the contrary, when I have said the same line, but taken my nipple out of her mouth by force, she will sometime fall asleep, but will usually react angrily. Even after she would fall asleep she would wake up shortly after whining, crying, and needing nursing even more.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would advise you to not take your nipple out and not refuse him ever. Just when it is getting to difficult for you to endure peacefully tell him that your milk is all done and mommy needs to sleep now. Then wait for him to finish and let go. Our children, especially at 2 years old, can grasp this concept. Distractions probably won&#39;t work at this age, nor are they as honest to your child.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;shirarocklin&quot; &lt;shirarocklin@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi again,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; This isn&#39;t really an unschooling question... but I am trying to apply unschooling principles to every area of life, so I thought this question could be appropriate here.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have a 2 year old who I would like to stop nursing at night.

It&#39;s about you, then, not him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it be that maybe he really needs that particular kind of  <br/>\ncloseness and that your efforts to change the routine make him cling  <br/>\nto his comfort even more? He knows you aren&#39;t really happy about his  <br/>\nnursing at night, but he needs it and your trying to change his life  <br/>\nin a big way. Perhaps his discomfort at being given other calming  <br/>\nmethods is what&#39;s making it difficult for him to calm down and sleep  <br/>\nand giving you the opportunity to sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor him, at two, it&#39;s still a huge part of his life! If he is allowed  <br/>\nto stop in his own time (not to say you can&#39;t offer other things, but  <br/>\nyou probably will have to find a way to be okay with his needs and not  <br/>\nresentful), he might stop nursing earlier if you stop resisting! I  <br/>\nremember being done with nursing before my daughter was. When I  <br/>\nstarted feeling a bit put-upon, she ramped up her need. I relaxed and  <br/>\nbreathed *a lot*.  I sorely missed that connection when she weaned  <br/>\nherself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing to remember that lack of sleep is always a possibility  <br/>\nwith small children. It won&#39;t last forever. It&#39;s sometimes hard to see  <br/>\nthat the light at the end of the tunnel isn&#39;t an oncoming train when  <br/>\nyou&#39;re in the middle of said tunnel, but things *will* change.<br/>\n<br/>\nNapping during the day with a toddler helps in getting some rest. Can  <br/>\nyour 5 year old cuddle up with you, too? Read a book to them both?  <br/>\nAlternatively, finding someone to be a mother&#39;s helper could be a  <br/>\nsolution. Someone to hang with the kids while you get some sleep?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt; My husband is not able to help me at night, unfortunately.
