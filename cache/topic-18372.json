Then we will have three.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you keep your eyes open, you can get some good deals.  I paid $100 for 386 mhz, 10G HD, CD drive, and 128MB RAM.  And I live in a low-population region.  If you are closer to an urban area, there should be loads of used computer stores or ads in the paper.  You don&#39;t necessarily need a printer for each computer.  Think of what you would spend on school supplies if your kids were in school.  A computer would be a great way to spend that money.  I have done some upgrading too.  If you watch for sales and rebates, you can often get extra drives and RAM for very little money.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Ellen <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\">   ----- Original Message ----- <br/>\n  Now to get to my main reason for posting - 2 kids and 1 computer! <br/>\n  and soon I believe it will be 4 kids and 2 computers but still the <br/>\n  same basic issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99936689,"authorName":"mozafamily","from":"&quot;mozafamily&quot; &lt;mozafamily@...&gt;","profile":"mozafamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Help dealing with dividing time ....","postDate":"1074821474","msgId":18372,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGJ1cHRoMitkM3Y3QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":18374,"prevInTime":18371,"nextInTime":18373,"topicId":18372,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am just going to have to see the Pirates movie now!!!
