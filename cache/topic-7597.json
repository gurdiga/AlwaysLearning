Unless you move in with the<br/>\nfamily, you have Very Limited knowledge of what goes<br/>\non in the home.  A neighbor&#39;s knowledge.  You can&#39;t<br/>\npossibly know what living there is like.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that household chores are a fine place to<br/>\nstart learning responsibility.  Unless they become<br/>\nwealthy enough to hire servants, all children will be<br/>\ndoing chores for the rest of their lives.  This IS<br/>\nreal learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention that this is the only &quot;schooling&quot; they<br/>\nget.  I am an unschooler.  I don&#39;t want to provide<br/>\n&quot;schooling&quot; for my children.  If you mean that that&#39;s<br/>\nthe only learning that is taking place, I&#39;d say that<br/>\nunless the children are locked in closets that is<br/>\nImpossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nLearning happens constantly.  That they are not<br/>\nlearning what you or I or anyone else thinks is<br/>\n&quot;appropriate&quot; is not &quot;child abuse&quot;.   And who are you<br/>\nor I or anyone else to make that Judgment in the first<br/>\nplace?<br/>\n<br/>\nI realize that some unschoolers believe that our<br/>\nchoice is only for the &quot;right&quot; kind of parents.  Those<br/>\nwith &quot;good&quot; educations, nurturing &quot;mom&quot; personas, and<br/>\nenough cash to provide ample &quot;stimulation&quot; and<br/>\nexposure to &quot;opportunity&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have placed  &quot; &quot;  around those words because I think<br/>\nthat they are all about personal judgment.  Which is<br/>\nsomething I become less and less tolerant of the older<br/>\nI get.  (How ironic is that? &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>\n<br/>\nI flatly reject that point of view. <br/>\n<br/>\nI firmly believe that children that are physically or<br/>\nemotionally abused should receive intervention as<br/>\nprescribed by law.  Even child advocates will tell you<br/>\nthat the removal of a child from their parents is<br/>\n,short of death, about the most harmful action that<br/>\ncan be done to a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let&#39;s be very, very careful that we don&#39;t injure<br/>\nthose we aim to protect in the name of &quot;appropriate<br/>\nhomeschooling&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbused children need to be aided and protected and<br/>\nsometimes completely removed from their parents<br/>\nforever.  Yes, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut government agencies ought to be spending their<br/>\ntime on enforcing the laws that protect abused<br/>\nchildren. They oughtn&#39;t be used to interfere with a<br/>\nfamily simply because they don&#39;t &quot;measure up&quot; to the<br/>\nstandards of another.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe those children have long conversations with<br/>\ntheir parents regarding the weather, the formation of<br/>\nant hills and wasp nests, politics, dad&#39;s job, current<br/>\nevents, what causes the seasons to change, why the<br/>\nneighbors go-go-go all the time and they don&#39;t ...<br/>\n<br/>\nWho knows?  Only they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat they or any children are &quot;better off&quot;  confined<br/>\nto a single building 180 days a year, age-segregated,<br/>\nvulnerable to bullies and (often) apathetic teachers<br/>\nand administrators, who will daily assess their value<br/>\nwith numbers and letters, monitor their every move, be<br/>\ninflexible to their changing interests, require them<br/>\nto ask to use the restroom, rush them through gobbling<br/>\ndown their lunch, arbitrarily enforce their silence<br/>\nand attention, show them no individual respect and<br/>\nattempt to quash their very uniqueness and mold them<br/>\ninto a &quot;productive citizen&quot; in accordance with<br/>\nwhatever the prevailing methods and systems are<br/>\ncurrently eschewed by the head educrats   ...   is a<br/>\nbelief that I will never be sold on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt counters everything I personally know to be true:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Children, all humans, have innate curiosity that<br/>\nflourishes in an environment of freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Institutions are about producing products, not about<br/>\ngrowing children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n and the parents don&#39;t incorporate<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; any<br/>\n&gt; creative teaching methods into it<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***Why should they?  Why should they be expected to<br/>\nadapt methods that were created for an environment<br/>\nthey are not in?  Those methods are part of a system<br/>\nthat they have elected not to participate in.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor that matter,what is creative?  Making dinner is<br/>\ncreative.  Painting a room and arranging furniture is<br/>\ncreative.  Making castles out of mud in the backyard<br/>\nis creative.  Having a boat parade in your bathtub is<br/>\ncreative.  Coloring outside the lines is creative. <br/>\nTaking information and forming a question about<br/>\npotential outcomes is creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nA take-charge attitude is a take charge attitude.  It<br/>\nmay or may not assist in learning.  Manipulatives and<br/>\nbooks and art supplies are all just that.  They may or<br/>\nmay not lead to forming creative thoughts and<br/>\npursuits.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout &quot;educational&quot; toys, children are very good at<br/>\nusing their fingers, verbal story telling and writing<br/>\non walls.  Creativity is virtually indestructible.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInspiration is everywhere.  Adults realize the power<br/>\nof Nature.  Adults pay big bucks to go do &quot;nothing&quot; in<br/>\nthe mountains, at the beach, on a lake.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, unless they are locked up,(as they&#39;d be in<br/>\nschool), all children are constantly learning.  Maybe<br/>\nthey are learning about the bugs in the backyard. <br/>\nMaybe they are learning about what&#39;s going on in the<br/>\nworld as CNN plays all day, maybe they are bored and<br/>\nspend hours creating stories in their minds.  When<br/>\nthey leave home, maybe they will become ornothologists<br/>\nor investigative reporters or novelists.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe don&#39;t know.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost adults hone in on one or two interests that they<br/>\nspend their lives pursuing.  A home that has TV and<br/>\ninternet access pretty much has opened up the world<br/>\nfor its&#39; children.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre the parents not responsive to the children?  Do<br/>\nthey ignore their questions?  Meet them with silence.<br/>\nProbably not.  If they are not ideal, are they less<br/>\ncaring than the foster parents they are likely to end<br/>\nup with ... or the classroom teachers they&#39;ll be<br/>\nshuffled among?  How much time and attention could<br/>\nthose children expect to receive from the alternatives<br/>\nthe government can provide?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  they just use the<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; kids as little slaves. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***They beat and chain them?  Starve and demean them?<br/>\nIs &quot;slaves&quot; really accurate?   Or do they make them<br/>\ntake out the trash, get the mail, feed the pets, fetch<br/>\ndad&#39;s beers ?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe they parent inconsiderately.  They are rude<br/>\nobnoxious people.  Do they arbitrarily demand More<br/>\nthan a school would. Do they offer less care and love<br/>\nthan a paid stranger would?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn judging any situation, considering the alternatives<br/>\nhas to be factored in.  <br/>\n<br/>\nVery few children are better off in the government&#39;s<br/>\ncare- during or after &quot;school hours&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre some individuals more worthy of &quot;Mother of the<br/>\nYear&quot; honors?  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo some kids get a wider variety of experiences that<br/>\nmay lead them to more options in their learning?  Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo we, as individuals, have the right and<br/>\nresponsibility to provide our children with the best<br/>\nthat is available to us? Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that mean we have the right to judge and attempt<br/>\nto force our particular ways and means on others we<br/>\ndeem &quot;less than the best&quot;  ?  No.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot in my view.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy view is that intelligent people recognize that<br/>\nacknowledging and accepting diversity is an evolved<br/>\ntrait.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that compassion is more productive than<br/>\npersecution.<br/>\nIf one is interested in the lack of experiences<br/>\noffered to a child, offering to provide alternatives<br/>\nis a positive action.<br/>\nWhether by a grandma or neighbor.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf grandma is really interested in the children<br/>\nlearning, she could ask the parents in what way she<br/>\nmight assist within the family&#39;s parameter&#39;s.  Can she<br/>\npay for a zoo membership, National Geographic<br/>\nsubscription, movie passes, dance lessons?   Will she<br/>\nbabysit on a regular basis so that mom can recharge<br/>\nher batteries?  A neighbor can invite the children<br/>\nover to help bake cookies or make holiday cards or<br/>\nplay legos.  If she is really interested in the<br/>\nchildren&#39;s best interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn 11 years of homeschooling- on and off in the early<br/>\nyears- and after 2 years of full time substitute<br/>\nteaching at a wide variety of schools k-12 in a Large<br/>\nurban/suburban school system ...   I have come to the<br/>\nconclusion that MOST of the time criticism is leveled<br/>\nagainst homeschooling/unschooling parents ...  that<br/>\nthose making the judgments are doing so out of ego<br/>\nrather than concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrandmas tend to ease away from &quot;concern&quot;  when given<br/>\nthe option of contributing resources to the children&#39;s<br/>\nlearning opportunities and neighbors/friends always<br/>\nhave some area of contention regarding how the other<br/>\ndoes it &quot;wrong&quot;.  This is not particular to<br/>\nhomeschoolers- though we are easier  and more likely<br/>\ntargets. And tend to want all our cohorts to make us<br/>\nlook good so we don&#39;t have to defend ourselves to<br/>\noutsiders.<br/>\n<br/>\nGranparents see homeschooling as a double rejection. <br/>\ninvalidating what they lived and the choice they made<br/>\nfor their own children.  If you are right; they must<br/>\nhave been wrong.  If you are doing better; they are<br/>\nless-than as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a ridiculous dichotomy to employ.

People tend<br/>\nnot to socialize with those who look down on them.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I have often thought of contacting someone<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; about the situation (I know what goes on because I<br/>\n&gt; live next door to this family)  but would the<br/>\n&gt; consequences be worse than the problem now. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>***Unless you know more than you&#39;ve written here-YES.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; finally<br/>\n&gt; just decided it wasn&#39;t my business and since they<br/>\n&gt; stay<br/>\n&gt; away from us  I don&#39;t worry about it anymore<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Unless they are comitting criminal acts, it isn&#39;t your<br/>\nbusiness to contact authorities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNothing prevents you from being  compassionate,<br/>\nfriendly, helpful and caring toward the children.  Or<br/>\nthe parents.  If you so choose. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain,  please don&#39;t take this personally.  I have had<br/>\nconversations re. homeschoolers that make choices that<br/>\nI don&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a woman in a group that I used to be involved<br/>\nwith that keeps a house that would not pass a health<br/>\ninspection.  Numerous pets, little care to clean-up,<br/>\netc...  IMO, it is really BAD.  In the opinions of<br/>\nevery other mom in my group who discussed it, it is<br/>\nBAD.  Even tour children think it is BAD.  Are they<br/>\nabusive?  No.  The family spends lots of money, which<br/>\nthey have a good supply of, on activities/lessons for<br/>\ntheir 7 children.  The children are bright and<br/>\ninteresting.  But, the house is an unqualified MESS. <br/>\n<br/>\nTurning her into authorities for the mess was brought<br/>\nup among those of us who discussed the situation.  It<br/>\nwas quickly eliminated as a possibility.  This is a<br/>\nhappy family living in a very filthy home.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>\nhave lunch there, but they are not criminals. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, I wouldn&#39;t even consider that kind of<br/>\ninterference.  It is much easier to criticize than to<br/>\ncompassionately act, but why?  Who benefits? <br/>\nCertainly not the children.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless the critical one is Genuinely interested in<br/>\nproviding -welcomed-  assistance,  I find it<br/>\nexceptionally easy to call a spade a spade. <br/>\nHe/she/they aren&#39;t doing it your way, Grandma?
