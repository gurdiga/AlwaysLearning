Not long after I sent the email to the group the <br/>\nother day, we made a decision to go out to eat which we don&#39;t do <br/>\nregularly anymore because I have food allergies that are kind of a pain <br/>\nto work around, it&#39;s pretty expensive and we are trying to get to a <br/>\nhappier place financially. I think maybe we all just needed a relaxing <br/>\nnight out of the house though because when I suggested it both my <br/>\nhusband and my son were enthusiastic about it. Then when we got home my <br/>\nson stayed downstairs to watch Walking Dead with us. I still chuckle <br/>\nthat the kid who was scared of Scooby Doo cartoons now loves playing <br/>\nzombie games and watching Walking Dead. It felt really nice having him <br/>\nthere with us. I think it may become a regular thing- watching Walking <br/>\nDead together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll keep inviting and offering. I asked him if he finds it annoying <br/>\nwhen I look for things to check out that I think he might be interested <br/>\nin and ask him about them. He said he doesn&#39;t mind, he&#39;s just not <br/>\ninterested in most of them right now. I asked him also to let me know if <br/>\nhe thought of anything that would help him do more of what he loves. We <br/>\nare getting a small tax refund this year and as we&#39;ve done for the last <br/>\ncouple of years we save some, use some to pay a bill and the rest is <br/>\nsplit it evenly between the three of us in the family. I asked him what <br/>\nhe thought he would do with it. There&#39;s a computer program he has been <br/>\nhoping to get that has something to do with recording himself playing <br/>\nvideo games... like others on youtube that do walkthroughs or reviews. I <br/>\nforget the name but I&#39;ll ask him again so I can try to learn some of it <br/>\nas well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s an interesting phase, this boy becoming man. Shortly before he <br/>\nturned 14 he was able to grow a full beard. I was really not ready for <br/>\nthat! He&#39;s grown around 6 inches in the last year so I guess it makes <br/>\nsense that all that energy going into growing would affect other aspects <br/>\nof his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nDana, thanks for the ideas about the location of his computer. He <br/>\ndefinitely enjoys having his &quot;command center&quot; (as we refer to it around <br/>\nhere) in his room. ;-) We actually used to have the XBox and computer in <br/>\na common area of the house. I have a hard time with the noise (he&#39;s an <br/>\nexuberant player at times) and with the screen motion of the game play <br/>\n(or even watching too much tv) giving me a sense of motion sickness. <br/>\nAlso his privacy is important to me, my being earshot range for his <br/>\nconversations with his friends might disrupt their flow. If he knows <br/>\nthings are going to get loud (he uses headphones already) he&#39;ll close <br/>\nthe door and I&#39;ll put on some soothing background noise. It works well <br/>\nfor us overall. Something portable is an interesting idea. I&#39;ll look <br/>\ninto that some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisaR<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 2/11/2013 10:30 PM, Sandra Dodd wrote:<br/>\n&gt; Kirby, my oldest, went through a couple of periods of being very quiet and insular.

We have a room off the kitchen where we have a big craft table and my son (15) is set up there with his computer.  He is very much into playing games and chatting with online friends and spends many hours each day with it.  With him being so close to the kitchen, we have more bits of conversation throughout the day.  He shares a lot about his game and the players involved.  There is lots and lots of listening on my part, but I can do that while cooking or whatever and it works out great.  I also get a chance to help him out if he is having a difficult time with any players.  He&#39;s learned so much recently about group dynamics and how to gracefully navigate some difficult personalities.  It&#39;s really been enjoyable to see his growth in this area.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your son has a haven set up in his room and doesn&#39;t want to move things, you might consider getting an IPAD or Window&#39;s Surface so he is more mobile.

I&#39;m <br/>\nstill working on my own adjustment to it. I feel like maybe I&#39;m falling <br/>\ninto benign neglect rather than active unschooling and I feel troubled <br/>\nby that. I want to respect his space and his process and maintain a <br/>\nfeeling of joy in his exploration of his passions (video gaming, <br/>\nflipnotes and to a lesser extent watching Mythbusters over and over).<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s 14, and pretty well into a late night, sleep most of the day <br/>\nroutine. I understand that and am content to let him find his own rhythm <br/>\nwith his needs for rest. My own nature tends toward night owl behaviors. <br/>\nRight now my own life tends to happen more during the day though so I <br/>\ntry to keep a routine that lets me be more effective as a day person <br/>\nsince I struggle with switching back and forth too often now. ;-) I will <br/>\npoke my head in the door of his room (after knocking) and see if he <br/>\nneeds anything to eat or drink or just to say hi a few times a day. <br/>\nSometimes I&#39;ll ask about his game and what&#39;s happening in it but often <br/>\nhe&#39;s online with friends so I don&#39;t want to be intrusive. When he comes <br/>\ndownstairs for a break I make sure to be available to chat if he wants <br/>\nto or invite him to do something with me. Even though he&#39;s done his own <br/>\nlaundry since he was young (he wanted to learn how to do it and has just <br/>\ndone it since) I&#39;ll ask if he needs anything washed if I&#39;m doing a load. <br/>\nI try to keep things like that going for the connection. I wonder if I&#39;m <br/>\ndoing enough to help his world expand or if I&#39;m missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still look for things to do I think he might be interested in, places <br/>\nto go, things to try. I have picked up here and there books or other <br/>\nitems I think might help him pursue whatever interest he&#39;s engaged in or <br/>\nmight be something new to engage in. I look for activities to offer to <br/>\ntake him too. He is taking Parkour classes once a week. We offered to <br/>\ntake him twice a week but for now he&#39;s content with it as it is so we <br/>\njust said it&#39;s an open offer if he changes his mind. We have a few <br/>\nhomeschool groups we hang out with and this could be part of my problem <br/>\nwith the uncertainty. One group I enjoy far more than the other. The <br/>\nthird we&#39;ve been touch and go with because it&#39;s the same day as Parkour <br/>\nand gets hard to manage everything on time. There&#39;s really only one <br/>\nother teen my son feels connected with there that we do get to arrange <br/>\ntime together at other times so he doesn&#39;t seem to bothered by not going <br/>\nto that group. The people are nice but all academically inclined from <br/>\nwhat I&#39;ve observed.<br/>\n<br/>\n  The one I enjoy is the efforts of a friend of mine and although I <br/>\nthink she and I are the only unschoolers, the other folks that come <br/>\ngenerally seem to see it as a social time and are easy going with us who <br/>\ndo not do &quot;school&quot; at home. There are a few teens there and it is pretty <br/>\nrelaxed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second group... is mainly made up of people who seem to do school at <br/>\nhome. Even the others that I think might be unschoolers have kids who <br/>\nseem to be very into many different things. There is a lot of <br/>\nconversation about curriculum, have-to&#39;s and pushing/making kids do <br/>\nthings even when they don&#39;t want to do it. There also seems to be some <br/>\nsort of rift/ division between the people who have been there a long <br/>\ntime/school at home types and newer people who may or may not be school <br/>\nat home, ecclectic or however they identify their education path. I <br/>\nhonestly don&#39;t feel great when I hang out there. There are a couple <br/>\npeople I enjoy talking with but I don&#39;t feel like I &quot;fit&quot; there. My son <br/>\nloves hanging out with the teens though. So I bring him there. I usually <br/>\nbring something to do. If it wasn&#39;t such a drive I&#39;d consider dropping <br/>\nhim off and letting him hang with the teens and going to do something on <br/>\nmy own. They have an offshoot book club that my son tried a couple of <br/>\ntimes but then he just never mentioned it and if I mention it to see if <br/>\nhe&#39;s interested I get a non-committal answer with a shoulder shrug, so I <br/>\nsay if he&#39;s interested I&#39;ll take him, if not, okay. They had a Dungeons <br/>\nand Dragons meetup too but that suddenly ended in kind of a strange way <br/>\nand apparently no one was willing to take over as Dungeon Master so that <br/>\nwas that. Which sucks because he really liked it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess where I&#39;m going is that he is really absorbed with the gaming <br/>\nand other than the Parkour and park days doesn&#39;t seem inclined to leave <br/>\nthe house. Most attempts to offer new things to try out or check into or <br/>\nexplore are rejected. I&#39;m worried he is missing lots of fantastic <br/>\nopportunities that might lead to other interests he&#39;d like to pursue. <br/>\nI&#39;m worried when he&#39;s older he&#39;ll say he wishes I&#39;d pushed him to get <br/>\nout of his room more.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot really knowing or having had the opportunity to see and talk with <br/>\nother unschoolers/teen unschoolers I&#39;m having a hard time relaxing. My <br/>\nhusband is having a hard time trusting our son will eventually move into <br/>\nwanting to do other things. He has visions of those negative stereotypes <br/>\nin his head of the 35 year old gamer living off their parents with no <br/>\nmotivation to move toward self sufficiency. I&#39;ve asked if he&#39;s <br/>\ninterested in reading about what other unschoolers have for experience <br/>\nand sometimes he is. We&#39;ve never been to a conference and I think it <br/>\nwill help if we can get to one, just getting time, money and days off to <br/>\nline up all at the same time has proven to be a challenge. (Not to <br/>\nmention having him in this country).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis dad is in the military and has been deployed many times in his life. <br/>\nHe&#39;s hopefully retiring at the end of this year. Totaling up all the <br/>\ndeployments and other &quot;away&quot; times my husband has been gone close to <br/>\nhalf of my son&#39;s life. I understand that has an impact on us all. When <br/>\nmy son was little he explored everything I could find for him. Around <br/>\nthe time he was 7 his dad deployed and my son decided handwriting wasn&#39;t <br/>\nfun anymore. Up until then he was often asking for paper to write on, <br/>\nthings to write with. He struggled with forming his letters and would <br/>\nget frustrated with himself. I tried to just be encouraging and let him <br/>\nknow that everyone I know had to practice in order to get it the way <br/>\nthey wanted to. I don&#39;t know if I helped or harmed but I started <br/>\nre-learning to write left handed again to show him that even I would <br/>\nhave to practice handwriting. (I had to write lefty one year after <br/>\ninjuring my wrist when I was in grade school.) My writing with my left <br/>\nwas far less legible than his handwriting. But at any rate, I didn&#39;t <br/>\npush it and when he said he didn&#39;t want to do that anymore I let it go. <br/>\nHe still won&#39;t write if he can help it. I get that computers are <br/>\neverywhere and likely he won&#39;t need to hand write the same way I did <br/>\ngrowing up, it&#39;s still a concern. When he does write it&#39;s the same as <br/>\nwhen he was seven and he still gets mad at how it looks. (He chooses to <br/>\nwrite things like his passwords and wish list or put stuff on the <br/>\ngrocery list if I&#39;m not there when we run out of something.) It&#39;s kind <br/>\nof the same with reading books. He used to read books a LOT and now he <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t seem to be interested... not even in the Halo series that he <br/>\nseemed to really enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m amazed at how many things he can memorize. But he doesn&#39;t remember <br/>\nour phone number or our address. Granted there&#39;s not much need in <br/>\ngeneral because we are usually together but it just seems odd to me that <br/>\nhe chooses not to memorize those things. He does go with friends <br/>\nsometimes and it seems to me that knowing our address is kind of <br/>\nimportant if anything should go wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe moved to where we are now about 16 months ago. This move was really <br/>\nhard on him. When we moved from the south up to NJ he wasn&#39;t super <br/>\nattached to anyone in particular. During the 7 years we were in NJ he <br/>\ndeveloped a number of friendships that we know were really hard on him <br/>\nto leave behind. We actually got him an XBox and his dad got one so they <br/>\ncould keep in touch while his dad was in Korea but we also knew it would <br/>\nhelp him stay in touch with friends who also had XBoxes. We got him his <br/>\nown cell phone so he could use that as well. It&#39;s kind of strange to me <br/>\nbecause he talks about missing friends, especially those not on XBox, <br/>\nbut he doesn&#39;t reach out to connect with them. They have either their <br/>\nown cell phones, facebook or email but neither my son nor they will <br/>\nreach out to each other. For the few I&#39;m friends with the parents, we <br/>\nseem to end up being go-betweens which is fine, it just feels odd to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI miss when he was little and still wanted to hang out with me whether <br/>\nit was watching something on tv, playing a game together, getting <br/>\noutside for a bit, cooking together or whatever all those things are we <br/>\nused to do together. I found the uncharted waters easier when he was <br/>\nlittle. I hope I can draw on the wisdom of those of you who have already <br/>\ngone through this stage for some things to think about to find our way <br/>\nthrough this next stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wordy. Lots on my gray matter these days. :-)<br/>\nThanks for being here with the space to hash this stuff out.<br/>\nLisaR</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70490,"nextTopicId":70526}}
