I appreciate your always <br/>\nkeeping your eye on what&#39;s best for the children.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m on <br/>\nyour lists.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Go easy on how you explain things that are feel-good ideas but not so<br/>\nabsolute.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely -- actually as I wrote it I realized that my modeling and <br/>\nliving it are the only real ways to explain it.  And it&#39;s tricky -- just <br/>\nas what we teach spiritually and religiously can be challenging (i.e. if <br/>\nGod is in everything, why did he make our dog blind?)<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;&quot;Any life they choose&quot; isn&#39;t a promise anyone can make to anyone.<br/>\nHonesty and living in the moment are way better than new-age fantasy<br/>\nfuture scenarios.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nActually for me this is honesty and living in the moment.  Don&#39;t worry, <br/>\nI&#39;m extremely practical and grounded -- sorry that my words didn&#39;t <br/>\nconvey that.  I am not at all into fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;This leaves the problem of other children allegedly having chosen<br/>\nabusive and sexual molesting parents.<br/>\nIt&#39;s not really a sound principle.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where we disagree but this isn&#39;t the place to discuss this.  <br/>\nJust to be clear, I lived a very traumatic childhood including sexual <br/>\nabuse_ so for me,_ I do know what I am talking about.  And I also <br/>\nunderstand how what I wrote could be painful to others. Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;If someone comes over and beats your child up, will you calmly accept<br/>\nthat with love on the grounds that your son attracted that energy?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course not - that&#39;s ridiculous -- that would be denying my energy.  I <br/>\nam the most protective mother you can meet ... I will fight anyone who <br/>\ntries to mess with my children and because of that I sometimes see <br/>\nthreat where there is none. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was saying is that I can now value and respect my husband&#39;s <br/>\nintuition - just as mine is valid, so is his.  Sorry for mixing it up <br/>\nwith &quot;new-age&quot; language ...  I can see if you thought I was a bimbo who <br/>\nblindly followed others&#39; leads why you would be concerned.  Not to worry ...<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Sorry to rain on your rainbow parade, but I&#39;d really prefer for this<br/>\nlist (my list) to stick with what&#39;s immediately useful and positive<br/>\nto anyone, and not venture into juju-magic that blames victims.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHey, I like rain -- but seriously I understand you&#39;d like me to be more <br/>\npractical and concrete with my posts. And for the record, I do believe <br/>\nin magic.  However &quot;blame the victim&quot; is not in my vocabulary.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\nDeborah, j.m.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":28155,"nextTopicId":28197}}
