I would like to respond to your questions<br/>\n&gt; about unschooling <br/>\n&gt; from my point of view.  Six months ago, I had never<br/>\n&gt; even heard of such a <br/>\n&gt; thing.  I&#39;m 32 and have 4 daughters ages 7, 5,<br/>\n&gt; almost 3, and 8 months. <br/>\n&gt;  My grand plan had been to send my dds to preschool<br/>\n&gt; and kindergarten <br/>\n&gt; across the street from us at the Catholic School<br/>\n&gt; where my husband went <br/>\n&gt; as a child and then homeschool them with a<br/>\n&gt; curriculum.  First dd went <br/>\n&gt; for the two years and I sent my second dd to their<br/>\n&gt; preschool.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I did try to teach my first dd at home, but it<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t working.  We were <br/>\n&gt; butting heads so much and she was just getting<br/>\n&gt; frustrated.  So I let up <br/>\n&gt; for awhile while I read more about homeschooling<br/>\n&gt; methods.  I came across <br/>\n&gt; Unschooling.com and signed up there as well as this<br/>\n&gt; list.  At first, I <br/>\n&gt; was amazed this was even possible, but it made so<br/>\n&gt; much sense to me.  I <br/>\n&gt; did have a lot of questions and got some pretty<br/>\n&gt; heated answers <br/>\n&gt; sometimes.  I&#39;m sensitive too especially when I know<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m ignorant about <br/>\n&gt; something, kinda like my oldest dd when I tried to<br/>\n&gt; teach her :)  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Anyway, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned about &quot;How to do<br/>\n&gt; it?&quot;   What you need <br/>\n&gt; to do is just love your child with an open heart and<br/>\n&gt; open hands.  Be <br/>\n&gt; supporting, but not surrounding.  This includes<br/>\n&gt; sleeping and eating and <br/>\n&gt; playing and everything they do.  I like to picture<br/>\n&gt; it like this:  The <br/>\n&gt; ideal in a free society is to get up every morning<br/>\n&gt; in joy, loving what <br/>\n&gt; you will do that day, knowing that the choices you<br/>\n&gt; make are your <br/>\n&gt; choices, and knowing you have the support of those<br/>\n&gt; around you to make <br/>\n&gt; those choices with the best intent.  This ideal<br/>\n&gt; should begin at birth <br/>\n&gt; and never stop.  It IS possible to give this gift to<br/>\n&gt; our children.  The <br/>\n&gt; most difficult parts will be letting go of all your<br/>\n&gt; childhood upbringing <br/>\n&gt; to &quot;force&quot; children to do things and instead guide<br/>\n&gt; them, talk to them <br/>\n&gt; nonstop in an equal, conversational way.  It is very<br/>\n&gt; hard to convince <br/>\n&gt; friends and family so remember, you really don&#39;t<br/>\n&gt; HAVE to convince anyone <br/>\n&gt; because it&#39;s YOUR child.  It can also be difficult<br/>\n&gt; to meet your state&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; (or area&#39;s) educational requirements.  I live in NY<br/>\n&gt; which is apparently <br/>\n&gt; one of the toughest, but it&#39;s not impossible, just a<br/>\n&gt; pain in the neck to <br/>\n&gt; do all the paperwork.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; So that&#39;s pretty much my take on it.  Oh yeah, from<br/>\n&gt; this day forward <br/>\n&gt; every second of your life should become an example<br/>\n&gt; for you child.  Life <br/>\n&gt; and breathe to set the example you want them to see.<br/>\n&gt; That&#39;s not always <br/>\n&gt; easy, but it&#39;s vital.  And smile and laugh hard<br/>\n&gt; every day.  Every single <br/>\n&gt; day.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Good luck, Heidi<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!

I m 32","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1168247404\">Hi Pam.  I would like to respond to your questions about unschooling <br/>\nfrom my point of view.  Six months ago, I had never even heard of such a <br/>\nthing.  I&#39;m 32 and have 4 daughters ages 7, 5, almost 3, and 8 months. <br/>\n My grand plan had been to send my dds to preschool and kindergarten <br/>\nacross the street from us at the Catholic School where my husband went <br/>\nas a child and then homeschool them with a curriculum.  First dd went <br/>\nfor the two years and I sent my second dd to their preschool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI did try to teach my first dd at home, but it wasn&#39;t working.  We were <br/>\nbutting heads so much and she was just getting frustrated.  So I let up <br/>\nfor awhile while I read more about homeschooling methods.  I came across <br/>\nUnschooling.com and signed up there as well as this list.  At first, I <br/>\nwas amazed this was even possible, but it made so much sense to me.  I <br/>\ndid have a lot of questions and got some pretty heated answers <br/>\nsometimes.  I&#39;m sensitive too especially when I know I&#39;m ignorant about <br/>\nsomething, kinda like my oldest dd when I tried to teach her :)  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned about &quot;How to do it?&quot;   What you need <br/>\nto do is just love your child with an open heart and open hands.  Be <br/>\nsupporting, but not surrounding.  This includes sleeping and eating and <br/>\nplaying and everything they do.  I like to picture it like this:  The <br/>\nideal in a free society is to get up every morning in joy, loving what <br/>\nyou will do that day, knowing that the choices you make are your <br/>\nchoices, and knowing you have the support of those around you to make <br/>\nthose choices with the best intent.  This ideal should begin at birth <br/>\nand never stop.  It IS possible to give this gift to our children.  The <br/>\nmost difficult parts will be letting go of all your childhood upbringing <br/>\nto &quot;force&quot; children to do things and instead guide them, talk to them <br/>\nnonstop in an equal, conversational way.  It is very hard to convince <br/>\nfriends and family so remember, you really don&#39;t HAVE to convince anyone <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s YOUR child.  It can also be difficult to meet your state&#39;s <br/>\n(or area&#39;s) educational requirements.  I live in NY which is apparently <br/>\none of the toughest, but it&#39;s not impossible, just a pain in the neck to <br/>\ndo all the paperwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that&#39;s pretty much my take on it.  Oh yeah, from this day forward <br/>\nevery second of your life should become an example for you child.  Life <br/>\nand breathe to set the example you want them to see. That&#39;s not always <br/>\neasy, but it&#39;s vital.  And smile and laugh hard every day.  Every single <br/>\nday.  <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck, Heidi</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1249031,"authorName":"Pamela Tiger","from":"&quot;Pamela Tiger&quot; &lt;mercyn@...&gt;","profile":"mercyn23","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Re: Re: How to do it?","postDate":"1058841061","msgId":15618,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAxYmEwMWMzNGZmOSQ1ZTc2Yzk4MCQzZjI0ZmVhOUBjb21wdXRlcj4=","referencesHeader":"PDEwNTg3Nzc4NTguMjk3NC40ODQ1MS5tM0B5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":15599,"nextInTopic":15626,"prevInTime":15617,"nextInTime":15619,"topicId":15535,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... like ... someone ... considered, or ... it ... it.

It is also a big hurdle to overcome the societal belief that children must be &quot;taught&quot; in order to learn anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t relate to your experience myself. In fact, on the odd occasion that my kids want some structured sort of teaching, I find it quite hard and unnatural to get into that mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband on the other hand is more like you, he just can&#39;t seem to help  going into teaching mode. It&#39;s not usually in a lesson kind of way, more of a lecture rather than a simple answer to a question. The kids often &quot;turn off&quot; as you said. Another thing he does is get out the dictionary, atlas etc. at the drop of a hat. This isn&#39;t a bad thing, but the way he does it turns the kids off too. It&#39;s sort of like...you need to know this, now.  I think he often misses natural teaching moments with this approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do is listen to the kids when they ask about something, and I can usually guess what sort of answer they&#39;re after. It might be a desire for in-depth knowledge, or it might just be a very quick and brief answer that they want. I might suggest various resources to help and I will often get these and look to satisfy my own curiosity. This may or may not lead to a discussion of the topic. If they do want to explore the topic at length then I will help them find further info, of the type THEY want. This might be a video, a computer game, a trip somewhere, a visit to someone in the know...It is hardly ever something promoted as an &quot;educational resource&quot; such as workbooks, textbooks etc. We find these to often be boring and limited.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know how long you have been unschooling, but I know it took me a couple of years to really relax, and feel confident in letting the kids be in charge of their own education (lives). Even though it was always easiest for me to let the kids go their own way, I felt varying levels of guilt about it during those first years. If you make a conscious effort to let go, I think you will find it easier as time goes by.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\nKerrin. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This may semm like just a plain silly question, but how do you keep <br/>\n </span></blockquote>  from assuming a &quot;teacher role&quot;?
