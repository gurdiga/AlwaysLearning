She went on to say that right now she&#39;s really into math and numbers, but really wouldn&#39;t like all the worksheets in school and is quite happy to be able to be really into math and numbers without anything interfering with it!==<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking about my experience with math in school compared to my unschooled children&#39;s relationship with math. I did very well in math in school. It was my favorite subject. I could sit for hours and do the math problems in the textbook. Most of it came very easy to me. I had a little trouble with Geometry in high school and Calculus in college but I still did well in those subjects. I remember once asking my dad (probably like almost all teens at some point) what the point in learning Algebra was. It certainly wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;d use outside of school. He told me the point was to learn how to think logically. Well, obviously, there are an unlimited number of ways to think logically. Algebra isn&#39;t the only way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I got out in the real world, I discovered very quickly that I had no idea how math related to that world. I only understood the abstract math provided by textbooks. I struggled for years to understand it all, especially when other unschoolers were telling me that my children would learn math from Legos. Huh? How could that be possible? They wouldn&#39;t understand the sentence, &quot;A + B = C.&quot; That&#39;s math.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen one day very recently I had a conversation about it with my dad, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics. He explained and somehow it finally clicked. He said I was thinking only about arithmetic and that&#39;s a very small and relatively unimportant part of mathematics. Mathematics is more importantly about things like the spatial relationships between things in this world. For example, knowing the best way to pack the car trunk. That&#39;s the type of math my children are learning. The math that works in the real world to solve real problems. I never got that from all the math I learned in school. As you can probably tell from my explanation, I still don&#39;t understand it fully but I finally got that&#39;s it&#39;s not just about numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while schooled children are memorizing multiplication tables, my children are learning how to intuitively understand the relationships between numbers and shapes and so on. It&#39;s hard to keep a tangible record of that, especially if you are comparing it to all the papers that schooled children have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is really long, I know, but I want to share one other story about Ethan. The other day he told me he was going to get married when he&#39;s 18. I commented that that was kind of young to get married. Most people aren&#39;t prepared to be married by 18. He told me he is learning how to be married from playing house, when he is usually the dad. He understands the relationship between his play and real life because he hasn&#39;t been told that play is frivolous. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":332901363,"authorName":"keetry","from":"&quot;keetry&quot; &lt;keetry@...&gt;","profile":"keetry","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: I thought my husband was onboard with unschooling...but finding out he&#39;s not","postDate":"1275568944","msgId":54532,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh1ODd2Zytuc3MwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh1NzRxbStsNnZhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54517,"nextInTopic":54533,"prevInTime":54531,"nextInTime":54533,"topicId":54486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Names, places,  <br/>\nwriting essays, doing geometry.  The unschooled kids are doing things,  <br/>\nbut not what would be considered &quot;academic things,&quot; generally  <br/>\nspeaking.   So the kids at home can start to feel nervous, and their  <br/>\nfriends at school ca start to be cocky.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here&#39;s the deal:  life is lumpy, and when people draw a curve on a  <br/>\ngraph to show that if a child learns at a certain rate over a number  <br/>\nof years he will be here at one point, and there at another point...  <br/>\nthat curve is not based on reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the time all these kids turn thirteen or fourteen, puberty is  <br/>\ncoming upon them, they are feeling and becoming different, more like  <br/>\nthe adults than like the babies, something big happens.  Many of the  <br/>\nschool kids have just had enough.  The &quot;no&quot; and &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;wait&quot; have  <br/>\nbuilt up in them until they can&#39;t take any more.   Meanwhile, the  <br/>\nunschoolers wake up and stretch their longer arms and their maturing  <br/>\nbrains, and the things they&#39;ve been accumulating over the years start  <br/>\nto gel and to make new sense.  They are synthesizing their own  <br/>\nknowledge from all the parts they&#39;ve collected, all the experiences  <br/>\nand trivia and connections they&#39;re making.   School kids are being  <br/>\ntold &quot;Just do what you&#39;re supposed to do; just follow the directions;  <br/>\nyour opinion isn&#39;t important.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy boys had a gaming friend, a little older than Kirby.  They played  <br/>\nall kinds of collectible card games and role playing games and video  <br/>\ngames with him for a few years.  When he was in 10th grade he was SURE  <br/>\nmy boys would love school and should go there.  &quot;How will they learn  <br/>\nchemistry?&quot; he said.  The friend liked school, was in theatre, and  <br/>\nmarching band.<br/>\n<br/>\nOver the course of about a year, his parents split up suddenly and  <br/>\ndramatically (and there were four of them all taking care of him  <br/>\ntogether, before that).  That was probably the greatest factor.  But  <br/>\nhe was also to the point of thinking that maybe school wasn&#39;t all  <br/>\nthat.  He was way over six feet tall (6&#39; 4&quot; came, somewhere in there),  <br/>\nand short little people were telling him no, sit down, wait, what do  <br/>\n*you* know, you&#39;re just a kid.  He could have knocked them down and  <br/>\nrun away.  They never would have caught him.    But our culture  <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t allow that.  He needed to grieve and recover from the loss of  <br/>\nhis home and parents, but the school schedule didn&#39;t allow for him to  <br/>\ncry, or to lick his wounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo he started cutting himself, piercing himself, taking drugs and more  <br/>\ndrugs, drinking himself into unconsciousness.   The last year of  <br/>\nschool, he HATED school and everything to do with school.  My boys  <br/>\nwere working when they were that age, and making enough money to buy  <br/>\ngames, gasoline, music, food for friends.   Their friend kept re- <br/>\nsetting his self-destruct sequence, and when he didn&#39;t self-destruct  <br/>\nhe went on binges and re-set it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back up to when the kids are nine:  At nine, the friend was calm  <br/>\nand confident and doing his school work every day.  My kids, at nine,  <br/>\nwere playing games, riding bikes, climbing trees, playing with Lego.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe snapshot of life at nine doesn&#39;t showcase the unschoolers.      <br/>\nSomething substantial is happening, but it isn&#39;t measurable in  <br/>\nsemesters and &quot;school years.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/substance\">http://sandradodd.com/substance</a><br/>\nThat was written when Marty was nine, and Kirby was eleven.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I thought my husband was onboard with unschooling...but finding out he&#39;s not.","postDate":"1275422244","msgId":54496,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDYyMzgzNS40OTE5MS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54495,"nextInTopic":54497,"prevInTime":54495,"nextInTime":54497,"topicId":54486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***I like both the ideas on charting our daily activities for my husband as well as the idea of a project on a subject Asher really loves.*** Perhaps instead","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2099182509\">***I like both the ideas on charting our daily activities for my husband as well as the idea of a project on a subject Asher really loves.***<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps instead of a &quot;subject&quot;, do a project on something that he loves.  Lego creations are fun to photograph.  The life cycle of frogs is interesting as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something about that age, the near 9 or 9ish age, where what unschoolers do looks very very different from what kids in schools do.  For my older daughter it seemed to stem from the multiplication tables.  The multiplication tables are like this big huge milestone in school.  Before that, much of school is about learning to read, and busy work.  Then along comes multiplication tables and people suddenly feel like their kids, if they aren&#39;t in school, are going to lag behind if they miss out on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschoolers stress about it.  If kids are at the multiplication age, other things start seeming more relevant too, like what level of reading a kid is at, or what extraordinary science projects their children are doing.  Testing is more prevalent and school, in general, becomes way more competitive than prior to that 8/9 age.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a person wants to continue unschooling, this is when they need to really step it up, especially if they have a reluctant partner.  From this point onward, in what I&#39;ve experienced and what I&#39;ve seen, unschooling kids diverge greatly from what school kids do.  It&#39;s going to look and feel very different.  They don&#39;t really even out or become strikingly &quot;better&quot; until they reach that balance in the teen years.  I&#39;m not even sure how to describe it, but it seems like unschooled teens reach this point of being sure within themselves, still growing and changing and learning, but there is this calm centered aspect that I see that I don&#39;t see in schooled kids much.  It&#39;s an element that many reluctant partners see and KNOW that it&#39;s been working when they get to that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween that 8/9 age and that point in teenhood, the primary unschooling parent needs to really see the learning and really bring the world to their kids and their kids to their partners.  Unschooling is really hard to get for some people. Just like a parent can present something to a child in just the way they know their child will receive it, they can do that for their partners as well.  What really did it for my own husband was going to an unschooling conference, and having lots of schooled kids around and seeing the differences in behavior.  It&#39;s very striking.  The academic stuff was more peripheral for him when he saw how our kids didn&#39;t have weird behavioral issues that other kids had.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: I thought my husband was onboard with unschooling...but finding out he&#39;s not.","postDate":"1275399850","msgId":54495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFDMUVCMDNGLUM5QjQtNDkwQi1CMEJBLUYzMzEzREE1MDdBQ0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGh0dmE0NSs1a240QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh0dmE0NSs1a240QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":54494,"nextInTopic":54496,"prevInTime":54494,"nextInTime":54496,"topicId":54486,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Earlier this year there was a blog post by a dad who was at the Ohio water park event.
