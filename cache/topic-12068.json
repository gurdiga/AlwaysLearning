Or <br/>\n<br/>\nis it because they can&#39;t read the ballot? We tend to blame lackluster <br/>\n<br/>\npoliticians or negative campaigning for low turnout at the polls. But what <br/>\n<br/>\nif the real reason is that most of our citizens are not sufficiently <br/>\n<br/>\neducated about the basic concepts of democracy to understand the issues – <br/>\n<br/>\neven those that directly impact their self interest? And what if that <br/>\n<br/>\nignorance is compounded by illiteracy? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI know enough math to know that in my case it wouldn&#39;t matter.  I quit voting <br/>\nyears ago.  Keith and a friend of mine who volunteers with the League of <br/>\nWomen Voters stuck a registration form in front of me a while back and then <br/>\nstuck an absentee ballot in front of me a while later.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut statistically, assuming the people who don&#39;t vote are as representative a <br/>\nsample of the constituency as those who DO vote, we could do with saving the <br/>\ngas money.  I&#39;m better off at home with my kids than studying up on a bunch <br/>\nof school bond issues and mil tax issues and city councilmen and judges, let <br/>\nalone U.S. Senators, the governor or the president.  <br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;For example, our public-school children hear that the Founding Fathers are <br/>\n<br/>\nnot to be revered. They were greedy, patriarchal oppressors who were in it <br/>\n<br/>\nfor the money and the power. America is not a noble experiment in freedom <br/>\n<br/>\nand equality. That was the cover story, as we stole the land from the <br/>\n<br/>\nindigenous people. America wasn&#39;t recently attacked by terrorists. America <br/>\n<br/>\nis the terrorist!&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nGosh.  Is it possible for people to have balanced opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;Those deconstructionists have been very busy, because they didn&#39;t stop with <br/>\n<br/>\nthe English language. They have also pretty successfully deconstructed <br/>\n<br/>\nfamily, religion, values, ethics and morality as well. We all know that, if <br/>\n<br/>\nthere can be no right answers, there obviously is no right and wrong. No <br/>\n<br/>\none&#39;s behavior can be judged because the most heinous acts can be excused <br/>\n<br/>\non the basis of what the perpetrator may have suffered at the hands of his <br/>\n<br/>\nparents, the police, the inequitable society. Yada, yada, yada.&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet $50 the writer was spanked lots and spanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make me prejudiced?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;God is dead (although the Wiccan goddess still has a fighting chance, I <br/>\n<br/>\nguess) – traditional morality is destructive; excellence is discredited and <br/>\n<br/>\ndevalued; grades are antiquated.
