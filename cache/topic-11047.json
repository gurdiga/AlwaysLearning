Running late we called home from Spokane and one of<br/>\nour son&#39;s said we had to call Amy, so we did. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe had just gotten back home after emergency surgery for a<br/>\ntubal pregnancy, she was naturally crying, which was good. <br/>\n<br/>\nI spoke with her boyfriend and asked him how he was, of course<br/>\nhe said he was fine!  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I said to him, don&#39;t stop my daughter from crying, she<br/>\nhas to get this out. Hold her in your arms all night long and<br/>\nlisten to her cry. He said, okay. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we got off the phone he apparently asked Amy how I knew<br/>\nthat he had been telling her to stop crying!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs humans we are not comfortable with tears and crying. Look<br/>\nat how we treat newborn babies, plug their mouths with<br/>\npacifiers and patting their backs, saying Sshhh and rocking<br/>\nthem all to be quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m all for rocking and snuggling, etc... but all my babies<br/>\nwere allowed to cry while I held them and listened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an art to listening!<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace and Love in...<br/>\nBarda<br/>\n<br/>\nA lurker who pops in from time to time!<br/>\n*********************************************************** <br/>\n&quot;Shipping&quot; is  My  Business -<br/>\n<br/>\nI just got back home from my House Special at The General<br/>\nMercantile.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Merc makes coffee the slow way, using a 1950&#39;s<br/>\n                                                              <br/>\n   Italian LaPavoni Espresso Machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy House Special is alot like &quot;Shipping&quot; .
