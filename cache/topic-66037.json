This seems to have helped a little which feels good. We are also trying that any situation where Sam and I are together, my husband doesn&#39;t come and interrupt or try to get involved, maybe just come to sit with us or be in the same room.

He and I have always been very close, and we spend a lot of time together, generally having a great time. However, I work two days a week and on those days my husband (his Dad) takes care of him. I work from home, and whilst I try to stay focussed on my work, I am ultimately available and he does come to visit me in my work room quite a lot. My husband tries to discourage this, because he knows I need to get on with my work, and I tend to give him a few minutes, but then gently remind him that I need to get on with my work now, and Daddy is here to play with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time now he has often expressed his dislike of his Dad. (It&#39;s not consistent - he also will often tell him in private how much he loves him etc.), but it seems if I&#39;m around or in his mind he will be very verbal about preferring me. This quite often gets to the point where it is upsetting for both my husband and myself, I mean, he will shout &quot;I don&#39;t want you, I want Mummy&quot;, or make aggressive arghhhhh noises at my husband to express his dislike. Quite often he will simply ignore his Dad&#39;s questions, not say hello to him when he comes home, tells him he can&#39;t join in the game etc. He makes it very obvious that he doesn&#39;t want Daddy, in a way that comes across as very unkind. He will then turn to me and smile and apparently expect me to just get on with something lovely with him, like a story or a game or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have asked him to speak to Daddy kindly. Recently I have started to tell him that he is being rude to Daddy when he does that kind of thing and that Daddy has a right to live in his home without being rude to, and that he must stop. That seems to be about as effective as saying nothing. In fact saying nothing might be better?, in that it makes less of a deal out of it, and we have tried that for a while too. I have also begun to tell him that I am finding it upsetting too, not just Daddy, but again I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good idea. This week my husband suggested maybe Sam should be sent to school, to &quot;teach him how to behave more politely toward people.&quot; Of course there are arguments that school probably won&#39;t teach him that at all..., I only mention it to illustrate something of how my husband is feeling. This situation does not seem to be improving. I am so unsure how to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I have been doing recently is trying to be extra caring and gentle with my husband. I thought it might help if Sam saw me taking the time to be more affectionate and caring. Even if it doesn&#39;t help, I figure it will still be nice for my husband!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think we have got into a pattern where my husband comes downstairs or comes home and expects to be unwanted, so he just does his own thing (and in some ways that kind of suits him), or sometimes he wants to talk to me about business, so then he doesn&#39;t seem that fun or interesting. I am trying to help him feel more welcome and appreciated. However, my son seems to prefer it if I barely speak to him! I think he sees his Dad as someone who potentially interrupts my focus on him. If I invite my husband to join in with us, the chances are Sam will shout &quot;NO!, I don&#39;t want Daddy&quot;, which leads to feelings of unease and upset or anger in one or more of us, so I tend to just carry on focussing on Sam, to keep the peace really. Sometimes I will say &quot;No, that&#39;s not kind, Daddy is allowed to play too&quot; and then Sam will either agree or get upset depending how he&#39;s feeling. I am constantly feeling in the middle, which most of the time I can manage ok, but<br/>\nsometimes I just get exhausted with it. (Another side issue with this is that sometimes I could really do with a little bit of headspace, and there is someone there able and willing to take over for a few minutes, but it has become almost impossible for me to have without a fuss, so it&#39;s not worth it. In the moment I often find the stress of negotiating more than the benefit of the time alone, but it means that sometimes I get to burnout, because I haven&#39;t taken those moments.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested to my husband that he come home with little presents, or fun things to show Sam or to do with him. He doesn&#39;t want to bring presents (I think he feels like he&#39;d be trying to buy his affection), but says he will try to be more interesting to my son, but it is very hard because there are no &#39;windows&#39;. I said maybe he doesn&#39;t need a window, just start doing the thing and if it&#39;s interesting to him Sam will come to get involved. But he says he is feeling very raw and doesn&#39;t want to feel criticised, and doesn&#39;t want suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started working from home, my husband and I agreed that they would go out on the days I work. But this quickly stopped happening, because they often don&#39;t want to go out. And I can see their argument of why should they, just because I&#39;m working from home?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility that has been on my mind is that I could change where I work, and move my office out of our house back to our workshop up the road (about a mile away), so that there is a natural boundary around the days I work, and his only choice is Daddy on those days. My main hesitation with this is that Sam will be even less happy with the situation, even though it might be clearer. And I&#39;m not sure it would help his relationship with his Dad in general, it might lead him to even more resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not found a way in which I can get all my work done in the evenings, as most often Sam is not asleep until around 9.30 or 10pm, by which time I am just too tired to begin a focussed, creative, work session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would very much appreciate knowing if this sounds like an age related trait which will naturally improve with care and time? Should we try to ignore it more, and Sam will naturally, with time, become less contrary to his father? Or are we getting something wrong somehow? Are we being too soft here?, I mean, sometimes I feel that Sam has the trump card to basically behave as he likes because we chose not to use punishing techniques and the natural consequences (us being sad or upset for example) don&#39;t seem to bother him that much. Has anyone else been through something similar?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to ask for more details if I haven&#39;t explained enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would very much appreciate any help, I am finding this very stressful and therefore it is affecting my parenting (and our family life and our marriage and my work and my peace) :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you in advance,<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with son and father&#39;s relationship","postDate":"1331282933","msgId":66048,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzEyODI5MzMuMzc5ODIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMjUwNS5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhQQ3R2UEJoRF90QURwVkhFRHlNeGY4RUIxR0dPRmozeEpuNVJwSlVhMlhIZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzEyMDc0MjIuNTg3MjUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4gPERVQjEwMS1XMjhDNjI0RDlFRUNFMkFDQzUwNEE4NkI3NTQwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDxDQU9PVGFYUEN0dlBCaERfdEFEcFZIRUR5TXhmOEVCMUdHT0ZqM3hKbjVScEpVYTJYSGdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":66047,"nextInTopic":66066,"prevInTime":66047,"nextInTime":66049,"topicId":66037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":" ***They didn t feel bought - they felt like their grandmother was a really nice person who thought about them and cared about them.

I don&#39;t have to do that as often as you, but when I do, I usually have a deadline (i&#39;m a freelance writer - and have a tendency to leave things to the last minute!) and need a good few undisturbed hours in there to get an article finished.<br/>\n <br/>\nIf I really need a good portion of time, I ask them to go out. We brainstorm ideas until we come up with something Kai wants to do. Ideally it&#39;s a fairly long way away, to avoid the possibility they come home before i&#39;m done - because if he&#39;s home, he does come into the room to find me - just because normally i&#39;m the one who does stuff for him - gets drinks, makes snacks, etc - he&#39;s not used to his Dad doing that so much in the daytime. Things they&#39;ve done include the zoo, go-karting, movies, indoor play places, fishing....perhaps you can come up with and idea that could become a regular thing? My son just likes to go to the mall, have sushi and browse the gaming shops?<br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps if they could have something &#39;they&#39; do, a weekly ritual, so to speak, it might help their relationship too?<br/>\n <br/>\n==Something I have been doing recently is trying to be extra caring and gentle with my husband. I thought it might help if Sam saw me taking the time to be more affectionate and caring. Even if it doesn&#39;t help, I figure it will still be nice for my husband!==<br/>\n <br/>\nYes, but if you do this in front of your son, it is likely to exacerbate the problems he&#39;s feeling toward his father. Can you just be normal to your husband when your son is around, and perhaps try and spend extra time with him when your son is asleep?<br/>\n <br/>\n==I suggested to my husband that he come home with little presents, or fun things to show Sam or to do with him. He doesn&#39;t want to bring presents (I think he feels like he&#39;d be trying to buy his affection), but says he will try to be more interesting to my son, but it is very hard because there are no &#39;windows&#39;.==<br/>\n <br/>\nI tend to agree with your husband, unless your husband genuinely finds things he thinks your son is into? My own father often tried to buy my affection with trinkets as a child - i was never fooled and privately resented him for doing it.  <br/>\n <br/>\nPerhaps a weekly ritual can be a window - something for just them when you are working? My son and husband wrestle. That&#39;s their thing - I guess their window. They have all sorts of little rituals that go along with wrestling that I have no idea about! Does your son play video games? Could your husband join in with those and they play together?<br/>\n <br/>\n==Another possibility that has been on my mind is that I could change where I work, and move my office out of our house back to our workshop up the road (about a mile away), so that there is a natural boundary around the days I work, and his only choice is Daddy on those days.==<br/>\n <br/>\nI would do this. Without hesitation. I don&#39;t have that option, but boy - i wish i did! I think you will obviously get more work done, and it will give your son and husband a chance to find their &#39;window&#39;.<br/>\n <br/>\nI hope some of this helps.

Gifts should be given just because you think someone might like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will help if he can let go of expecting what he offers to succeed. It should be a gift :-) This can be really hard! We tend to put ourselves and our self esteem into choosing with the goal of making someone happy. That&#39;s too much expectation that depends on what can&#39;t be controlled (someone else&#39;s feelings) and often leads to disappointment. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf his goal, instead, is figuring out what your son enjoys, then the feedback of your son not liking something is useful input rather than failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Something I have been doing recently is trying to be extra caring <br/>\n&gt; and gentle with my husband. I thought it might help if Sam saw me <br/>\n&gt; taking the time to be more affectionate and caring. Even if it doesn&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; help, I figure it will still be nice for my husband!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Yes, definitely nice for your husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if your son&#39;s jealous of your time, it&#39;s likely to make him more upset.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about engaging your son in helping you do thoughtful, sweet things for your husband? And come up with thoughtful, sweet things for your son too. Like making your husband&#39;s favorite meat dish and your son&#39;s favorite dessert. If he doesn&#39;t want to -- yet! -- that&#39;s okay. If he doesn&#39;t&#39; want you to, let him know -- not in a shaming way but as a fact -- that it makes you happy to do nice things for people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; Recently I have started to tell him that he is being rude to Daddy when he does<br/>\n&gt; that kind of thing and that Daddy has a right to live in his home without being rude to,<br/>\n&gt; and that he must stop. That seems to be about as effective as saying nothing.<br/>\n&gt; In fact saying nothing might be better?<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe he&#39;s jealous. He sees you as his and your husband as competition. He doesn&#39;t want to share. (Seems to me there&#39;s an age when this is not uncommon.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe your husband smells funny to him. Just some biochemical reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there&#39;s something that rubs him the wrong way about how your husband interacts with him. Not necessarily wrong in a universal sense but something he personally doesn&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be helpful to figure it out, but maybe you can&#39;t know. He might not know. You could ask -- if you can listen without giving him negative feedback. <br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately his feelings are his feelings and he can&#39;t (yet) control them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you can help him react to his feelings better. Telling him he&#39;s rude doesn&#39;t give him better tools. It just makes him angry and hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nEngage him some other time well away from the moment, like during the day. Don&#39;t explain a lot! Keep it simple. He probably already knows what he&#39;s saying is hurtful. You&#39;ve already told him people need to be safe (though it sounds like you used too many words.) Go right to coming up with a better way he can ask for what he wants.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the less he&#39;s put in the position where he feels he needs to be rude to get what he wants the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Help with son and father&#39;s relationship","postDate":"1331209373","msgId":66038,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRDMzZERTkzLTEwQzEtNDA4Ri04RTA4LTNFMTM4MzY2RUI5OUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzEyMDc0MjIuNTg3MjUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzEyMDc0MjIuNTg3MjUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":66037,"nextInTopic":66039,"prevInTime":66037,"nextInTime":66039,"topicId":66037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-When I first started working from home, my husband and I agreed that they would go out on the days I work.

But this quickly stopped happening, because they often don&#39;t want to go out. And I can see their argument of why should they, just because I&#39;m working from home?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of all the reasons you wrote out.  Things aren&#39;t going well with you all in the same space.  If your being there is keeping them from interacting, and they don&#39;t want to go out all the time, find a some-and-some solution, maybe.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your husband doesn&#39;t want ideas from you, maybe he would listen to the sound file at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a>  especially if you could get it into the car somehow (CD or iPod) so he could listen without you around.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf he can see himself as a partner, and see that every choice he makes is getting him &quot;warmer&quot; or &quot;colder&quot; as to the goal of closeness with his son, it might help him.  He&#39;s either making a deposit or a withdrawal from the credit in that account.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could see that your son is doing damage to the relationship, too, but IF they are partners, and one of them is five years old, it falls on the other one to do the hard work and to take up the slack.  It won&#39;t be forever that he&#39;s five.  But it will be for the rest of your husband&#39;s life that the relationship&#39;s health or lack thereof will affect them both.  My kids are grown now and being really helpful and kind to me and Keith as we&#39;re getting older.  Being patient and generous with them was a good investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother aspect is that inside each man is the little boy, comparing and reviewing (whether consciously or not) and if your son is getting to do things your husband didn&#39;t get to do, there will be some jealousy.  If you&#39;re treating him in ways your husband&#39;s mom didn&#39;t treat him, he&#39;s going to have a reaction, maybe very deep inside.   Those are things for you to think about, not to say, probably--at least not all at once in any insensitive way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I said when one of my kids was preferring me and saying &quot;I don&#39;t like dad,&quot; was &quot;I really like him.&quot;  So they would be nice to him for my sake sometimes, and that was okay.  As they got older there was more to like.  The kids were becoming more aware, and so was the dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283914803,"authorName":"jo kirby","from":"jo kirby &lt;jokirby2004@...&gt;","profile":"jokirby2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Help with son and father&#39;s relationship","postDate":"1331207422","msgId":66037,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzEyMDc0MjIuNTg3MjUuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjI5NjA2Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":66038,"prevInTime":66036,"nextInTime":66038,"topicId":66037,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi all, I would very much appreciate your thoughts on this, which is currently going on pretty much on a daily basis in our house: My son is just five, and an","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1413949088\">Hi all, I would very much appreciate your thoughts on this, which is currently going on pretty much on a daily basis in our house:<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son is just five, and an only child. He and I have always been very close, and we spend a lot of time together, generally having a great time. However, I work two days a week and on those days my husband (his Dad) takes care of him. I work from home, and whilst I try to stay focussed on my work, I am ultimately available and he does come to visit me in my work room quite a lot. My husband tries to discourage this, because he knows I need to get on with my work, and I tend to give him a few minutes, but then gently remind him that I need to get on with my work now, and Daddy is here to play with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a long time now he has often expressed his dislike of his Dad. (It&#39;s not consistent - he also will often tell him in private how much he loves him etc.), but it seems if I&#39;m around or in his mind he will be very verbal about preferring me. This quite often gets to the point where it is upsetting for both my husband and myself, I mean, he will shout &quot;I don&#39;t want you, I want Mummy&quot;, or make aggressive arghhhhh noises at my husband to express his dislike. Quite often he will simply ignore his Dad&#39;s questions, not say hello to him when he comes home, tells him he can&#39;t join in the game etc. He makes it very obvious that he doesn&#39;t want Daddy, in a way that comes across as very unkind. He will then turn to me and smile and apparently expect me to just get on with something lovely with him, like a story or a game or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have asked him to speak to Daddy kindly. Recently I have started to tell him that he is being rude to Daddy when he does that kind of thing and that Daddy has a right to live in his home without being rude to, and that he must stop. That seems to be about as effective as saying nothing. In fact saying nothing might be better?, in that it makes less of a deal out of it, and we have tried that for a while too. I have also begun to tell him that I am finding it upsetting too, not just Daddy, but again I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good idea. This week my husband suggested maybe Sam should be sent to school, to &quot;teach him how to behave more politely toward people.&quot; Of course there are arguments that school probably won&#39;t teach him that at all..., I only mention it to illustrate something of how my husband is feeling. This situation does not seem to be improving. I am so unsure how to handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething I have been doing recently is trying to be extra caring and gentle with my husband. I thought it might help if Sam saw me taking the time to be more affectionate and caring. Even if it doesn&#39;t help, I figure it will still be nice for my husband!<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think we have got into a pattern where my husband comes downstairs or comes home and expects to be unwanted, so he just does his own thing (and in some ways that kind of suits him), or sometimes he wants to talk to me about business, so then he doesn&#39;t seem that fun or interesting. I am trying to help him feel more welcome and appreciated. However, my son seems to prefer it if I barely speak to him! I think he sees his Dad as someone who potentially interrupts my focus on him. If I invite my husband to join in with us, the chances are Sam will shout &quot;NO!, I don&#39;t want Daddy&quot;, which leads to feelings of unease and upset or anger in one or more of us, so I tend to just carry on focussing on Sam, to keep the peace really. Sometimes I will say &quot;No, that&#39;s not kind, Daddy is allowed to play too&quot; and then Sam will either agree or get upset depending how he&#39;s feeling. I am constantly feeling in the middle, which most of the time I can manage ok, but<br/>\n sometimes I just get exhausted with it. (Another side issue with this is that sometimes I could really do with a little bit of headspace, and there is someone there able and willing to take over for a few minutes, but it has become almost impossible for me to have without a fuss, so it&#39;s not worth it. In the moment I often find the stress of negotiating more than the benefit of the time alone, but it means that sometimes I get to burnout, because I haven&#39;t taken those moments.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggested to my husband that he come home with little presents, or fun things to show Sam or to do with him. He doesn&#39;t want to bring presents (I think he feels like he&#39;d be trying to buy his affection), but says he will try to be more interesting to my son, but it is very hard because there are no &#39;windows&#39;. I said maybe he doesn&#39;t need a window, just start doing the thing and if it&#39;s interesting to him Sam will come to get involved. But he says he is feeling very raw and doesn&#39;t want to feel criticised, and doesn&#39;t want suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I first started working from home, my husband and I agreed that they would go out on the days I work. But this quickly stopped happening, because they often don&#39;t want to go out. And I can see their argument of why should they, just because I&#39;m working from home?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility that has been on my mind is that I could change where I work, and move my office out of our house back to our workshop up the road (about a mile away), so that there is a natural boundary around the days I work, and his only choice is Daddy on those days. My main hesitation with this is that Sam will be even less happy with the situation, even though it might be clearer. And I&#39;m not sure it would help his relationship with his Dad in general, it might lead him to even more resentment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not found a way in which I can get all my work done in the evenings, as most often Sam is not asleep until around 9.30 or 10pm, by which time I am just too tired to begin a focussed, creative, work session.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would very much appreciate knowing if this sounds like an age related trait which will naturally improve with care and time? Should we try to ignore it more, and Sam will naturally, with time, become less contrary to his father? Or are we getting something wrong somehow? Are we being too soft here?, I mean, sometimes I feel that Sam has the trump card to basically behave as he likes because we chose not to use punishing techniques and the natural consequences (us being sad or upset for example) don&#39;t seem to bother him that much. Has anyone else been through something similar?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease feel free to ask for more details if I haven&#39;t explained enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would very much appreciate any help, I am finding this very stressful and therefore it is affecting my parenting (and our family life and our marriage and my work and my peace) :-(<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nThank you in advance,<br/>\nJo<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":66053,"nextTopicId":66033}}
