There are MANY uses for artistry with cloth other than &quot;becoming a top fashion designer.&quot;  There is costuming for theatre, or children&#39;s dance recitals; window and mannequin dressings; home sewing; dressing dolls; home decorating; quilt making, fiber arts; dressing oneself in the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut my hardest thought was that the odds of a child being diagnosed with autism are MUCH higher than the odds of a child **having** autism, as the definition has been QUITE expanded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSymptoms to look out for, the ad says:<br/>\n<br/>\nNo big smiles or other joyful expressions by 6 months<br/>\nNo babbling by 12 months.<br/>\nNo words by 16 months.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany children speak later than a year; that&#39;s not pathological.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought maybe someone was making money off that, but then noticed it was by the Ad Council, which provides public service announcements, and so it wasn&#39;t sponsored by a drug company or a group of doctors or the education association. :-)  I felt a little better, but not much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked Glenda&#39;s practical ideas about laundry and bedding.

(Now after reading so much about food restrictions I could kick myself.) Tonight she asked if she could have a can of tea and I told her that I thought it wasn&#39;t a good idea considering what happened last night, but that it was her body. She said something like, &quot;So what does that mean? That confuses kids.&quot; I said, &quot;I mean that I&#39;ve told you my opinion, but it&#39;s your body and your choice.&quot; She drank it.===<br/>\n<br/>\nThere can be better times of day or night for certain foods or drinks for some people, though, and you can provide some guidance in that area -- it sounds like that&#39;s what your daughter was looking for when she asked if she could have the tea.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, we seldom drink caffeinated drinks in my family. My son and I prefer to drink water, and the sodas my hubby likes to have on-hand are decaffeinated. My son and I have both figured out through first-hand experience that if we have an energy drink or other caffeinated drink the caffeine tends to make it challenging for us to fall asleep for the next 10-12 hours. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo when he gets a hankering for an energy drink or caffeinated soda, he&#39;ll ask if I think it&#39;d be okay for him to have it. We&#39;ll figure out about how long it could be before the caffeine wears off, and if it&#39;ll be later than he&#39;s usually up I&#39;ll ask if he wants to wait and have it after his first meal the next day. Or I&#39;ll suggest having a small amount of whatever it is that night and having the rest the next day. Or if he&#39;s going to be gaming late with friends and doesn&#39;t mind being up later than usual, then the caffeinated drink becomes a non-issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe really important thing here is that if he chooses to wait to have the drink until the next day, I make a point to remind him of it early enough the next day that it won&#39;t interfere with what time he wants to go to bed. I put the energy drink or soda in a very visible place so *I* will see it early enough in the day to remind him after he&#39;s up.<br/>\n<br/>\n===I told her that I thought it wasn&#39;t a good idea considering what happened last night===<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you don&#39;t know for certain the tea is causing the bedwetting, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when my stepson was 4 or 5 and came to spend the summer with us, he announced that he was allergic to chocolate so couldn&#39;t have anything chocolate. It turned out his mom felt chocolate made him hyper, so she told him and us he was allergic to it and couldn&#39;t eat it anymore. (That didn&#39;t last very long.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you&#39;re not positive the tea contributes to the bedwetting, please be thoughtful about how you present that to your daughter. If she&#39;s concerned about the tea or the caffeine in it being problematic and she wants to see if having the tea earlier in the day results in no bedwetting, you could certainly help her with that by being sure other drink options are easily available in the evenings when she&#39;d otherwise be having the tea. If she sets a cut-off time each day for having tea and you notice that time&#39;s drawing near and she hasn&#39;t had tea, you could ask if she wants some before it gets much later in the day and/or take it to her. But I think it&#39;s damaging to imply there&#39;s a connection between the tea and bedwetting without having taken the steps to confirm it. <br/>\n<br/>\n===She seems embarrassed by it, but not enough to try doing anything differently or to put the clothes in the washer or let me know so I can before everyone sees/smells them.===<br/>\n<br/>\nI know at 15 I was way, WAY!, more tolerant of dirty clothes, soiled bedding, and things like that than I am as an adult . . . even as an adult, my tolerance was a lot higher when I was single and in my 20&#39;s than it is nowadays!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could put a kitchen-sized metal lidded trashcan in your 15yo&#39;s room, line it with a plastic trash bag, and let her know that&#39;s where her wet pj&#39;s and bedding go. That keeps the odor out of the bathroom she shares with her sister. You can put one of those stick-on deodorizers inside the trashcan to help keep the odor in check; a trashcan with a firm-sealing lid will help keep the odor down in her bedroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t wait on her to let you know if she needs fresh bedding; check daily. If she&#39;s in her room, you could pop your head in and ask in an upbeat voice &quot;need anything washed?&quot;; if she&#39;s not in her room, check the hamper in her room or her bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could put two sets of sheets on her bed, with a liner in-between them, so that it&#39;s easy for her to strip off wet sheets + liner and there already be fresh sheets underneath ready to use. And if there&#39;s a hamper in her room just for soiled bedding + pj&#39;s and she makes use of the hamper, it&#39;d be easy for you to grab it and tote to the washer. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;d be sure to have blankets or comforters that can be easily washed & dried at home, and are easy to take on and off the bed so stripping the bed is easy-n-quick. (I recently purchased a down-alternative comforter for my teen&#39;s bed, because the dogs like to nap on his bed and we need the dog hair washed off regularly because of allergies. His previous comforter was too bulky for our washer and dryer; this new one is lightweight, easy to launder, and easy to take on/off the bed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some point she will very likely become more interested in getting soiled bedding to the laundry quicker. For now, I&#39;d focus on doing what you can to make it easy for her to strip her bedding when needed and to contain the bedding + pj&#39;s in her room until you can snag them in the morning and toss them into the washer. <br/>\n<br/>\nGlenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Peeing the bed; an older child","postDate":"1324674922","msgId":64607,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQjgyNzkwLTkyRDQtNDU4Ny1COEM4LTg5MTk5RTkzNEVCMUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGpkMmkzOCs4MGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGpkMmkzOCs4MGczQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64605,"nextInTopic":64636,"prevInTime":64606,"nextInTime":64608,"topicId":64528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sometimes I think when one part of a person s body grows bigger, other parts haven t caught up.

I&#39;m not sure how many times--she usually doesn&#39;t tell me when it happens--I&#39;ve just found her wet clothes in the clothes hamper or the bidet a few times. She did actually wet her bed once, which she told me about. I told her it was no big deal and helped her change the sheets. Other times when I&#39;ve found the clothes I&#39;ve just simply washed them and asked her about it later when her little sister wasn&#39;t around. When I&#39;ve asked her about the wet clothes, she&#39;s told me that she wakes up and gets out of bed to go, but doesn&#39;t make it in time. Earlier today when I found them in the bidet I asked her to please put them in the washing machine and I would wash them for her. A few minutes ago she still hadn&#39;t done it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Once in the past I suggested not drinking so much at night, or maybe going to bed a little earlier so she&#39;s not so exhausted and &quot;out of it&quot; and can wake up more easily (She&#39;s a night person like me and keeps really late hours, but then also is a really, really deep sleeper.), and that if it did happen to please tell me so I could wash her clothes.  A few nights ago, really late, she was going to drink a can of tea and I stopped her. (Now after reading so much about food restrictions I could kick myself.) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Tonight she asked if she could have a can of tea and I told her that I thought it wasn&#39;t a good idea considering what happened last night, but that it was her body.

She seems embarrassed by it, but not enough to try doing anything differently or to put the clothes in the washer or let me know so I can before everyone sees/smells them. I&#39;m worried how she would feel if one her friends dropped by and happened upon her wet clothes. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to her little sister who is disgusted by the smell. (They share a bathroom.) <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Should I not say or suggest anything at all, just wash the clothes if I notice them and act like it never happened? Should I make her wash the clothes? Could this be a physical problem or is this usually emotional? I haven&#39;t really noticed any new stressful situations that could contribute. I&#39;m not sure how to handle it. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We&#39;re also supposed to go to my in-laws for a few days for Christmas, so there&#39;s the added complication of being in someone else&#39;s house to think about too.

When his bladder is really full (like after sleeping all night) and he has a spasm he can&#39;t stop the flow once it has started so he still has accidents at night on occasion.  He wore diapers to bed until some time last year when he felt really embarrassed that he still wore them at 9 years old. <br/>\n <br/>\nIf your daughter is feeling embarrassed about peeing in her bed , she might be embarrassed about you suggesting she wear a pad.  If you think so, maybe you could leave them in a place where she can see them, but not everyone else, like her underwear drawer.  Maybe along with tips you&#39;ve printed online on how to prevent bed wetting.<br/>\n <br/>\n=Should I not say or suggest anything at all, just wash the clothes if I notice them and act like it never happened? Should I make her wash the clothes?=<br/>\n <br/>\nSometimes when my son does have an accident they are so huge that he&#39;ll wake up covered from chest to knees in urine.  He&#39;ll tell me and while he cleans up I&#39;ll strip the bedding and wash it.  I really don&#39;t feel that I need to say anything about it.  At that point we both know he wet the bed. He doesn&#39;t want to wake up covered in urine and I don&#39;t want to shame or embarrass him because he did. <br/>\n <br/>\nHe has asked me on a couple of occasions what he can do about wetting the bed so, I know it&#39;s a concern of his. I&#39;ve mentioned setting an alarm in the middle of the night to wake him to go pee or maybe not sleeping so late. The biggest accidents he has are when he sleeps in.  If it&#39;s past 10AM and he is still asleep I will go ask him if he wants to wake up to go pee.  He usually does.<br/>\n <br/>\n=I&#39;m worried how she would feel if one her friends dropped by and happened upon her wet clothes.=<br/>\n <br/>\nBecause of the spasms, if my son holds going pee during the day he&#39;ll have a small accident.  I don&#39;t usually know about these until I see him in different clothes.  He changes his clothes and puts them in the hamper.  If I can smell urine I take his hamper and wash the clothes.  If he is having a friend over I take the entire hamper out of his room and put it in the laundry room every time just in case there is a smell I can&#39;t smell and I squirt a couple squirts of room freshener.  I know he doesn&#39;t want this to be happening and he certainly doesn&#39;t want his friends to know either.  I help him in ways that I can.<br/>\n <br/>\n=And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to her little sister who is disgusted by the smell. (They share a bathroom.)=<br/>\n <br/>\nDisgusted sounds so strong.  Does the younger daughter make a big deal about being disgusted about the smell? Does the older daughter feel like her sister thinks she&#39;s disgusting?  Maybe your daughter can keep a hamper in her room so her sister doesn&#39;t have to be disgusted by the smell. <br/>\n <br/>\n=Tonight she asked if she could have a can of tea and I told her that I thought it wasn&#39;t a good idea considering what happened last night, but that it was her body. She said something like, &quot;So what does that mean? That confuses kids.&quot; I said, &quot;I mean that I&#39;ve told you my opinion, but it&#39;s your body and your choice.&quot; She drank it. She seems embarrassed by it,=<br/>\n <br/>\nHer reaction sounds like she feels judged.  Maybe because she asked if she could have a can of tea, not what whether or not you thought it was a good idea.  My son is very sensitive to even the slightest hint of judgement and I have found this page to be helpful when talking to him about things he is sensitive or embarrassed about:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/truck\">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a>  Did you not think it was a good idea because of the caffeine?  Or to have a drink at night?  If it was the caffeine, can you get decaf can tea so she can still have tea at night if she wants too?<br/>\nIf you decide to go to the doctor, I would talk with the office ahead of time about just checking her to make sure nothing is medically wrong and not focusing on bed wetting.  Because of my son&#39;s medical condition we see a urologist twice a year.  There was one time where the doctor asked about bed wetting.  When I said it still happens because of the spasms he jumped all over it and he spent a lot of time talking about how to fix bed wetting.  My son was really embarrassed to be sitting there while someone talked openly about him peeing the bed.<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":223130287,"authorName":"Krisula Moyer","from":"Krisula Moyer &lt;krisula@...&gt;","profile":"krisulaula","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Peeing the bed; an older child","postDate":"1324423619","msgId":64582,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDZGQzRGQzFELUMyRkYtNDgxOS1BN0IzLTFDRDEzRTUyODg4M0BsZW1vbmNyYWIuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":64568,"nextInTopic":64594,"prevInTime":64581,"nextInTime":64583,"topicId":64528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Both my girls did this well into the preteen years.

The best thing I discovered (wish I had known about it all along)  was bed wetting pads that are smaller than the mattress.  They are just about as big as a baby blanket.  My daughter sleeps on top of one and if she wets, the pad can be removed until morning without disrupting her sleep too much (she does this herself)  usually I just have to wash the pad and the top sheet.  (You can get these at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bedwettingstore.com/reusable-waterproof-overlays.html)\">http://bedwettingstore.com/reusable-waterproof-overlays.html)</a>  Disposable chucks pads like the kind they use in hospitals work too, but my daughter didn&#39;t like the feeling of paper and plastic.  Under that and underneath the regular sheets I keep a rubber mattress pad to protect the mattress in case of shifting or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pad can also go into a sleeping bag (or you can buy a &quot;sleeping bag liner&quot; at the same link).  My daughters tended to stay dry better while sleeping at a friend&#39;s house but in case they didn&#39;t the pad can be folded in half inside the sleeping bag and no one has to know it&#39;s there.  Just bring the whole thing home the next day and throw it in the wash.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith these practical matters taken care of, the bedwetting was no longer a big looming problem, just a slight laundry inconvenience that will pass in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nKrisula<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":484143809,"authorName":"mcve@ymail.com","from":"&quot;mcve@...&quot; &lt;marloes@...&gt;","profile":"mcve@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Peeing the bed; an older child","postDate":"1324348412","msgId":64568,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpjb3M1cytmaTNhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxQkY5MDc0LTY3M0QtNEZEOC05MjZFLTVDOTI5REQ1QTA4MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64556,"nextInTopic":64582,"prevInTime":64567,"nextInTime":64569,"topicId":64528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am a Type One Diabetic and just before I was diagnosed (14yrs old) I occasionally wet the bed.

Lots of teens sleep a lot, because their bodies are changing quickly.  And those changes could cause something like a new relationship between the time-range she&#39;s used to, and her sleep needs.  I bet she&#39;ll adjust.  I doubt it has anything to do with trauma or fears, but even if it does she could use pads for a while.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Sandra<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"Meredith","from":"&quot;Meredith&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Peeing the bed; an older child","postDate":"1324335436","msgId":64556,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpjb2ZnYytjNmF1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOZDZMcVRONzRpNjRyQkN2d3RfcXllTGFuZlJ4NTdyNUx3dmV6U0VhMVFlUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":64553,"nextInTopic":64568,"prevInTime":64555,"nextInTime":64557,"topicId":64528,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The last time I remember it happening where I didn&#39;t wake myself up was college. But I did it a lot -- what seemed like a lot to me -- as a teenager. Usually I&#39;d wake up before I&#39;d flooded the whole bed, but it definitely happened from time to time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know that I ever told anybody when it happened. And I think it probably happened more when I was a teenager than it did when I was a kid. Maybe hormonal shifts played a part? Maybe I was more exhausted because of my schedule and the sports I was playing? Not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that I was a very sound sleeper and that I wet the bed on a regular basis longer than either of my siblings did. My son is also a very sound sleeper and at 9 it&#39;s only been in the last year (or several months, I really can&#39;t keep track) that he&#39;s been dry with regularity and is only now comfortable sleeping over somebody&#39;s house without taking a pullup. <br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in the south and drank caffeinated iced tea all day long, and in college I would often come home from work and drink a cup of coffee to relax before going to bed. But as an adult I only drink coffee in the morning and then I switch to water and I have to go to the bathroom at least once in the middle of the night almost every night. And my son and I seem to have to urinate more frequently during the day compared to my husband and my daughters. So while I know caffeine is a diuretic, I think biology and/or physiology plays a big role.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are sure there&#39;s nothing like an undiagnosed urinary tract infection going on, I&#39;d tell her that it&#39;s not something completely uncommon and ask her how she wants to handle it: switching to decaf; or setting an alarm to go to the bathroom a few hours after she&#39;s gone to bed; trying some of the herbal or homeopathic remedies; putting some sort of pad on the bed to save the mattress and just dealing with it when it happens ...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found that many quilted pads also happen to be waterproof. You can get thin wool pads to put under the sheets (that&#39;s what my husband and I used on our own bed when co-cleeping with infants/toddlers).

Like mentioned there are all types of mattress covers or pads that can been worn. The pads may be a better choice to keep her clothes from getting wet too, eliminating the need to wash her wet clothes all together. Talking about how not drinking lots of fluids late at night right before bed might help also but let her be the one to make the decision. I probably would buy thick pads anyway to keep in her bathroom but not pressure in any way to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe probably is really embarrassed about it. I use to play things off when I was embarrassed about something giving others the impression I didn&#39;t care but that wasn&#39;t true at all. I just didn&#39;t really know *how* to communicate my needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n~&quot; Should I make her wash the clothes?&quot;~<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you &quot;make&quot; her wash her own clothes now? If not she may see this as you trying to &quot;punish&quot; her for doing something wrong. If I was the one who wet the bed I would not be happy if my husband *made* me wash my clothes. I would probably want to anyway but if my husband went and got the washer started I would see that as a friend helping me out with an accident. <br/>\n<br/>\n~&quot;I&#39;m not sure how to handle it&quot;.~<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe looking at it from the angle if you were the one wetting the bed instead of your daughter might help. How would you like to be treated if this happened to you? How would you have liked your parents to have handled something like this?

Other times<br/>\n&gt; &gt; when I&#39;ve found the clothes I&#39;ve just simply washed them and asked her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about it later when her little sister wasn&#39;t around. When I&#39;ve asked her<br/>\n&gt; &gt; about the wet clothes, she&#39;s told me that she wakes up and gets out of bed<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to go, but doesn&#39;t make it in time. Earlier today when I found them in the<br/>\n&gt; &gt; bidet I asked her to please put them in the washing machine and I would<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wash them for her. A few minutes ago she still hadn&#39;t done it.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Once in the past I suggested not drinking so much at night, or maybe going<br/>\n&gt; &gt; to bed a little earlier so she&#39;s not so exhausted and &quot;out of it&quot; and can<br/>\n&gt; &gt; wake up more easily (She&#39;s a night person like me and keeps really late<br/>\n&gt; &gt; hours, but then also is a really, really deep sleeper.), and that if it did<br/>\n&gt; &gt; happen to please tell me so I could wash her clothes. A few nights ago,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; really late, she was going to drink a can of tea and I stopped her. (Now<br/>\n&gt; &gt; after reading so much about food restrictions I could kick myself.)<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Tonight she asked if she could have a can of tea and I told her that I<br/>\n&gt; &gt; thought it wasn&#39;t a good idea considering what happened last night, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; that it was her body. She said something like, &quot;So what does that mean?<br/>\n&gt; &gt; That confuses kids.&quot; I said, &quot;I mean that I&#39;ve told you my opinion, but<br/>\n&gt; &gt; it&#39;s your body and your choice.&quot; She drank it. She seems embarrassed by it,<br/>\n&gt; &gt; but not enough to try doing anything differently or to put the clothes in<br/>\n&gt; &gt; the washer or let me know so I can before everyone sees/smells them. I&#39;m<br/>\n&gt; &gt; worried how she would feel if one her friends dropped by and happened upon<br/>\n&gt; &gt; her wet clothes.
