I meant to <br/>\ntell about last night, and got off on all the other things that had <br/>\nbeen going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, you have to imagine my narrow kitchen. It&#39;s a galley <br/>\nkitchen..you can almost touch both sides with your arms outstretched <br/>\nand about 16 feet long. The kids pulled my folding laundry door <br/>\nacross the entrance so there was a very narrow opening to the kitchen <br/>\nand put up a sign that said &quot;You can get in if you have an I.D. <br/>\nbecause we&#39;re cooking&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of us was issued an &quot;ID&quot;. This spawned into a menu (Sierra wrote <br/>\nup about three before settling on one we all agreed on) that had <br/>\nitems like &quot;copcaks&quot; (cupcakes) and &quot;cooces&quot; (cookies). Trevor made <br/>\nup a badge for himself that said &quot;manager&quot; complete with a picture of <br/>\nhimself. So now we&#39;ve got a manager, an owner (me), a Chef (Jared) <br/>\nand a waitress/menu designer (Sierra).<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen was asleep so Markus had to be our customer.<br/>\nI was so amazed at how diligent they all worked, even cleaning dishes <br/>\nin order to have a work space. Jared made fried rice, we had lentil <br/>\nsoup, salad and Sierra made up a sherbert/fruit dessert.<br/>\nThe table actually got cleaned off by the kids (that&#39;s a first) and <br/>\nthey set up candles and a lovely place setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Markus came upstairs for his dining experience, they served him <br/>\nlike pros, Sierra looked so cute in an apron.:)<br/>\nSo from cooking and cleaning, to serving and menu creation they did <br/>\nit all with me acting as part cook, part clean up crew. <br/>\nAnd the best part?<br/>\nJared and Sierra each got a nice tip!<br/>\nFunny how motivated people get when they&#39;re interested in something <br/>\neh?<br/>\n<br/>\nRen</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19263,"nextTopicId":19253}}
