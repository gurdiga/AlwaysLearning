I<br/>\nthought I would add it here:<br/>\n<br/>\nMore thoughts on parenting<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that has amazed me the past two years is how the &quot;mainstream<br/>\nway&quot; can seem so.... inevitable... inescapable... I guess that is why it<br/>\nis called &quot;MAINSTREAM!&quot; (maybe is should be mainRAPIDS, or<br/>\nmainHUGEROARINGRIVER&quot; -- GET OUT BEFORE YOU DROWN IN IT!!! )<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what was really, REALLY liberating for me was realizing that I<br/>\ncan do things differently and it is NOT WRONG to do so. That I can do<br/>\nthings differently and BE HAPPY (a lot happier than some people seem to<br/>\nbe doing things the &quot;normal&quot; way.) That I can do things in a way that<br/>\nfeels right and natural to me and not fight it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good example is the whole &quot;sleep issue&quot;. I first read about<br/>\nco-sleeping while I was still pregnant (one of Dr. Sears&#39; books). I<br/>\nloved the idea, it sounded so wonderful. But then MG went without a<br/>\nfight to the crib and slept well at 5 weeks. Well, she slept well until<br/>\nshe was about 5 months anyways, and then started to wake up every hour<br/>\nor so! Man was I tired for a couple of months.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started to sleep with her when we went on vacation and she never went<br/>\nback to the crib. I loved it! At first we didn&#39;t really talk about it to<br/>\nfamily and friends unless it came up. I heard all sorts of thing from<br/>\npeople -- mostly what a BIG mistake it was. I heard someone talking<br/>\nabout her own 1 year old son and &quot;Ferberizing&quot; and how much harder it<br/>\nwas to walk away from their crying when they could scream, &quot;Mama mama!!&quot;<br/>\nShe concluded, that you &quot;have&quot; to do it though.... most people seem to<br/>\nassume that eventually you WILL have to let them cry it out, and it is<br/>\neasier to do when they are little. If you sleep with them then you are<br/>\njust helping them form bad habits, no one will get good sleep, and you<br/>\ncertainly must be doing some kid of damage to your marriage! Also, when<br/>\nand how are you going to get them out of your bed?<br/>\n<br/>\nI used to worry more about these things, even though I loved sleeping<br/>\nwith my little girl (and I can see in my husband&#39;s face that he enjoys<br/>\nit too). I think that one problem people have is with the idea that you<br/>\nMAY sleep with them for a lot longer than you planned on. Or that<br/>\nsleeping arrangements may be flexible. Or that kids need help to fall<br/>\nasleep. Personally, I am happily accepting all of these possibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like drifting peacefully with my family on our own little side stream<br/>\nthank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk I&#39;m back. This is not the post anymore... The more I read about<br/>\nunschooling and think about how I want to live life the more I realize<br/>\nthat I just need to DO it. I don&#39;t need to convince anyone else (family<br/>\nincluded). I&#39;m also realizing that what I&#39;m doing is not really all that<br/>\n&quot;radical&quot; although it may seem that way to others. It helps me to not<br/>\nfeel that I am being radical -- then I am not so defensive. I am just<br/>\nliving my life in the way that I think is best for me and my family. And<br/>\nI hope to be a good example for others that there may be a more<br/>\nenjoyable, even BETTER way to live. &quot;They&quot; (whoever they may be!) won&#39;t<br/>\nget the message either if they are feeling defensive. I am also<br/>\ncontinually surprised that MORE people don&#39;t try to live by at least<br/>\nsome of these principles -- don&#39;t people want to live peacefully,<br/>\njoyfully? To enjoy their children and partners to the maximum? I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t understand... but I am trying to be patient and kind both with<br/>\nmyself and others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":285628717,"authorName":"thehomeopathicway","from":"&quot;thehomeopathicway&quot; &lt;thehomeopathicway@...&gt;","profile":"thehomeopathicway","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Hi and  understanding what we are doing here","postDate":"1213770244","msgId":35522,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGczYTltNCsxMG5vMEBlR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGczYTRiMytjbTRwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":35520,"nextInTopic":35534,"prevInTime":35521,"nextInTime":35523,"topicId":35370,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Melissa, thank you for finding this.
