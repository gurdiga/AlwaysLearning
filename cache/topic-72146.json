I remember estimation tripped me up for *ages* in school ... couldn&#39;t understand why we were being asked to &#39;guess&#39; something when they&#39;d already shown us how to work it out exactly.   It never made sense for me until I actually had to estimate something out in the real world.

I remember back in our early days of unschooling, of worrying about how she would &quot;learn math&quot; since I have such anxiety surrounding anything math or numbers related. She doesn&#39;t have that anxiety. No one judging her for not &quot;getting it&quot; or trying to show her the &quot;best&quot; way to arrive at an answer. Instead she&#39;s had the space to learn in her time and her way, and as she needs it. Today we were playing Animal Jam together and she needed about 2000 points to be able to buy something for her animal. She was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1150 already and so she asked me to play the &quot;dress-up&quot; game which gets 200 0points each time you win. Without even hesitating she said, if you can win at least 5 times I&#39;ll have enough plus some extra.&quot;.
