I have received comments in the past about &quot;how will he ever learn organization and responsibility if...&quot;, mostly when people see he hasn&#39;t had forced chores or when my husband & I help him out to remember things/organize/etc.  Seeing him blossom this fall has been such a glowing and happy example of how this peaceful and respectful partnering works so well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has taken time management and organization into his own hands, keeping track of practice times, games, and locations, which seem to change from day to day.  He lets me know what time he&#39;d like to leave for practice daily, as well as washing his gear or asking me if I will wash certain items, and getting all of his stuff together before leaving the house.  All on his own initiative.  Sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday morning, league players were required to volunteer 2 hours of their time at the annual pancake breakfast fundraiser.  Lots of boys 9-14, their jobs included greeting, seating, serving, and bussing tables and other cleanup.  Alexander went in and worked hard for the 2 hours.  Loved it, too.  Groups of kids, meanwhile, were resisting verbally or trying to hide or escape outside to avoid the tasks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHe came home excited and happy, saying the experience let him know what it must be like to have a job.  He wouldn&#39;t mind being a waiter.  ;-)  My sister & I were having a whirlwind canning afternoon, and he proceeded to help us chop apples and vegetables and make outdoor runs to empty scrap buckets onto the compost heap.  He worked with us for over two hours, happily chatting and telling stories.  He said it was fun, and we talked about jobs in food prep that some folks have.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA day full of happy experiences helping others.  None of it &quot;required chores&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeanna</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57371,"nextTopicId":57442}}
