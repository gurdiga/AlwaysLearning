I am having an online discussion and I would prefer to provide links as opposed to writing my *personal* perspective on this one.

I looked on Sandra Dodd&#39;s site but didn&#39;t see anything specific, although I&#39;m sure it&#39;s there. <br/>\n<br/>\nmartyrdom<br/>\nand controlling play<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the blog if you want to read it:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mamatrue.com/2010/05/05/play-and-let-play/\">http://mamatrue.com/2010/05/05/play-and-let-play/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nKelly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kelly.halldorson.com/blog\">http://kelly.halldorson.com/blog</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://skeletonsdontsleep.com\">http://skeletonsdontsleep.com</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://facebook.com/jeffnkelly\">http://facebook.com/jeffnkelly</a><br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":53975,"nextTopicId":53979}}
