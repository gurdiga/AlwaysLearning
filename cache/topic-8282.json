I&#39;m not happy&quot; (my baggage).....I have a child who <br/>\njust seems to melt more easily....whose &#39;language of love&#39; is getting <br/>\nthings....whose reaction to &#39;pick a special food&#39; is to find 3 and whine/cry <br/>\nbec. he can only get one.....when it is just the two of us, I can manage <br/>\nokay...when all three are with me, the other 2 pick up on the &#39;I want&#39;s and <br/>\nit&#39;s hellish.....I&#39;d say I&#39;m a pretty attentive Mom, too, I just think that <br/>\nbeing in stores and seeing things that he doesnt have is very hard on him <br/>\nspecifically so I try not to go there.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t shop with the kids much anymore....<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s a thought, may be the kids are bored when they go on big 1 hour <br/>\nshopping sprees and the &#39;I want&#39;s are a reaction to the boredom....????<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: fruits and vegetables<br/>\nThere have been lots of ideas here about that....the biggest one, imo, is the <br/>\nletting go....it seems you have the belief that if &#39;left to their own <br/>\ndevices&quot;, they will eventually pick the healthy food (&#39;healthy&#39; being defined <br/>\nby whatever theory you hold!).....THEN, theoretically, you can similarly <br/>\ntrust them that they will pick the healthy foods eventually at home - all <br/>\nthings being equal...<br/>\n<br/>\nanother anecdote:<br/>\nI am exploring with new vegetables myself....so I&#39;m making eggplant dip <br/>\n(which can be like a bean dip), squash, zucchini, and spinach.....I NEVER <br/>\nEVER had these things before this year!  Going with the theory that you can <br/>\nonly change yourself, I decided to make myself healthier through a greater <br/>\nvariety of veggies....<br/>\n<br/>\nMy theory (latest): what you wish for in someone else, do it yourself in <br/>\nyourself.....<br/>\n(eg.: want more loving?  give more loving.....want folks to be kinder and not <br/>\nshout at each other?  then be kinder and don&#39;t shout......want folks to eat <br/>\nbetter, then eat better....make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, nuff said.....Thanks for throwing out the idea....gave me a lot to <br/>\nthink about.....
