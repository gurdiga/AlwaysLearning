It&#39;s rude, and I feel it&#39;s so disrespectful to not even credit the source of your inspiration. I usually choose to skip right over, since an online spat will do little to bring more peace to my family, but it kinda bugs and surprises me every time.  Additionally, I&#39;m fairly certain they know exactly what they are plagiarizing, and also that they are looking for a fight to get more attention. <br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m getting old, but I value integrity over self-promotion. <br/>\nThank you again, Sandra, for all you have done for families. I first found AL after skimming through your unschooling site, thinking it sounded so natural and logical (it is, but much more complicated in practice, in a good way!)<br/>\nI lurk at the Facebook page, but it&#39;s nothing like this place once was.

(As an avid reader I don&#39;t say that lightly!) She is amazingly good at seeing and presenting things clearly - and their are many other amazing people there sharing as well - all of them (including Sandra) willing to change their minds. They like to think, dissect, analyze, brainstorm, and share - all in the name of helping families unschool and have sweeter, more joyful lives. I highly recommend people reading there for the best information on how to unschool - and it&#39;s all free!<br/>\n<br/>\n_______________________<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a nostalgic streak in me.  I miss various good old days, probably more than is healthy. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there was a time that this group was the best resource for unschooling anywhere.  Now it’s not.  Now, probably Pam Laricchia’s site is, and Joyce’s for a solid, static collection.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMine doesn’t stay still or stable.  It’s alive, but it’s twitchy. :-)  (I guess I can say that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do miss when this group had a fifty posts a day and all the regular writers were tuned and well oiled and quick to respond.  (Okay, I don’t know which, if any, were oiled in any but that one metaphorical way…)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my own input lately, maybe the best ways to get to my recent writing are:<br/>\nRadical Unschooling Info on facebook<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/303347574750/</a><br/>\nIt also is quieter than it used to be; you can read without joining the group, but you can’t read without joining facebook, I don’t think.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust Add Light (because there’s usually a link to something on my site, and if not, to something else in that blog, or directly to something by Pam Sorooshian, or Joyce Fetteroll, or from Pam Laricchia’s growing collection)<br/>\nFairly often the writing here is new, but I rarely say so.  Sometimes I don’t have a quote to share, so I find a photo I like and write something to match it.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com\">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUNSCHOOLING SITE NEWS, SANDRADODD.COM<br/>\n&quot;READ A LITTLE, TRY A LITTLE, WAIT A WHILE, WATCH.&quot;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com\">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSite news, with new pages, and revamped or added-to pages, also with a recent Just Add Light photo and a link back over there from it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBoth of those latter two have randomizers.   They can be used as dice, as Magic 8 Balls, as Ouija boards. :-)  If those are against your religion, you could use them to look for signs from God.  If that’s against your religion, maybe just stay in here.  This group is pretty isolated and safe. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there’s always posting something here.   I’ve had some posts from here go into my junk mail (which shows with my other mail), but it’s possible that for some reason yahoogroups mail isn’t as respected by sorting programs as it once was.  :-)  Also, in my mail program, it’s no longer showing who the post is from, which is irritating.  These are things beyond my control, as far as I know.  <br/>\n<br/>\n*IF* this group does die out, please remember it fondly, search the archives sometimes for good parts, and use some of the resources above to keep your unschooling tuned up.  Oiled, maybe.  Responsive.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes, <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":78496,"nextTopicId":78508}}
