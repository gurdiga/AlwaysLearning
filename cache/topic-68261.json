It may be used in an indirect manner, and have the form of irony, as in &quot;What a fine musician you turned out to be!&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re a whole different person now...&quot;, and &quot;Oh... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years!&quot; or it may be used in the form of a direct statement, &quot;You couldn&#39;t play one piece correctly if you had two assistants.&quot; The distinctive quality of sarcasm is present in the spoken word and manifested chiefly by vocal intonation ...[9]<br/>\nHostile, critical comments may be expressed in an ironic way, such as saying &quot;don&#39;t work too hard&quot; to a lazy worker. The use of irony introduces an element of humour which may make the criticism seem more polite and less aggressive. Sarcasm can frequently be unnoticed in print form, oftentimes requiring the intonation or tone of voice to indicate the quip.[citation ne<br/>\n-=-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSO sarcasm would be using those words with a negative intention (being cruel, contemptupous, destructive and plain mean! )and not the intention to be funny or play around!<br/>\nÂ <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":284087656,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;semajrak@...&gt;","profile":"semajrak","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"3"},"subject":"Sarcasm...Was: being cheery and not sharing bad news","postDate":"1343056366","msgId":68293,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGp1anBsZSttbWlnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzNDI5OTgyMTAuNDUwNzIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjEyMDYwMi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":68292,"nextInTopic":68294,"prevInTime":68292,"nextInTime":68294,"topicId":68261,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Many years ago I wasn&#39;t.  But after an entire childhood enduring severe peer abuse and parents that weren&#39;t a soft place to land, my nature has fundamentally changed.  I believe those three things have been a coping mechanism for me.  I don&#39;t like it about myself and I try not to be that way around my kids but I fail frequently.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading that article reminded me of an experience I had about a week ago playing World of Warcraft with my adult son.  We were in one of the hardest dungeons and it was my first time there so I wasn&#39;t familiar with the fight mechanics and how to respond.  Rather quickly another player (these groups are composed of five people pulled from all over the country randomly) started insulting me.  At first he used sarcasm.  But it got worse...it became out and out mean stuff.  It triggered all those feelings of powerlessness and helplessness I felt as a kid.  My son (who was also on Skype with me) told me to ignore it.  He tried to stand up for me but that only marginally helped.  It continued of and on for the rest of the dungeon, lasting around 20 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfterwards I told my son how upsetting it was for me to be bullied like that by a stranger.  But he insisted that it wasn&#39;t bullying...it was &quot;trolling&quot;.  I knew &quot;trolls&quot; in internet nomenclature to be people that said mean things just to get a rise out of people.  He insisted that because it was just a game that it was &quot;only&quot; trolling and that I should shrug it off.  I found that to be a strange response.  So, I did some Googling and found many articles about it.  It seems that many kids in I&#39;d say around the 14-25 year old age range right now differentiate the behavior.  They overall see it as acceptable and not serious because in the gaming environment there is this separation that exists.  Most trolls believe it is their &quot;avatar&quot; that is saying the mean things to another &quot;avatar&quot;.  Most do it because they describe it as &quot;fun&quot;.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps the meaning of sarcasm in our culture is evolving?  I think some of the best television and movies are English made.  They absolutely ooze with sarcasm and &quot;biting wit&quot; (Shakespeare was a pro at it!).  I think there is a very fine line between hateful sarcasm and humorous sarcasm.  My dad &quot;teased&quot; me constantly in a good natured way up to the day he died.  He was a &quot;smart Alec&quot; and so am I.  I really do try to confine my sarcasm to that kind of silly teasing but what Sandra has said about lightness and joy has made me re-evaluate how much of that I want to continue.

And I&#39;ve done enough mock sword play with wooden swords to know that being hit in the gut with a stick can be a rollicking good time if both parties are into it. It&#39;s not so much a matter of sarcasm versus irony as being aware and sensitive to people and situations. There are times George and I fling irony and sarcasm around all in good fun, and times when one of us starts then says &quot;woops, my bad, you&#39;re not in the mood, are you?&quot; And there&#39;s a fellow I work with who&#39;s similar - he can play rough, verbally, although there&#39;s a second fellow who can&#39;t and we&#39;re both very careful how we &quot;play&quot; with him because he can snap without much warning. <br/>\n<br/>\nRay, my stepson, doesn&#39;t really understand sarcasm as a form of play - whether because of his personality or past experiences, I don&#39;t know. My daughter is much more savvy about word play and understands the idea of sarcasm (not so much irony, yet - too subtle), although she&#39;s not very skillful with it yet. I let her know when it&#39;s Not a good time to use it, especially with other people. She shouldn&#39;t be sarcastic when she comes to work with me - not even to my witty co-worker, because he&#39;ll see her as a little brat who needs to be put in her place, rather than a quirky, interesting kid who likes the same video games and cartoons he does. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; We can only be truly free when we let all of our judgments about others fall away<br/>\n </span></blockquote>**************<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s judgement and there&#39;s judgement.

Don&#39;t ask. It&#39;s fine not to know.<br/>\n<br/>\n-------------<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a suggestion about families, and children, and learning, and  <br/>\nthe news. Please, anyone with a child too young to google or to read,  <br/>\ndon&#39;t review for them terrible news about dead babies or shootings or  <br/>\nwars. Make their lives happy, where they are, today.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor moms: If you don&#39;t know anyone directly affected by bad news,  <br/>\ndon&#39;t allow yourself to be &quot;directly affected&quot; in such a way that you  <br/>\ngo deep into your feelings about &quot;what if&quot; and &quot;poor families.&quot; It is  <br/>\npossible to slip down too far, and who&#39;s taking care of your children  <br/>\nthen?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Batman fans. :-)<br/>\nIf you have a kid wanting to go see the Batman movie, Take HIM! Don&#39;t  <br/>\nwhine or whinge or wring your hands about something that happened  <br/>\nsomewhere else. It was not about the movie, and it was not about a  <br/>\ntheater. It was about one guy who was for some reason unhappy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t let your own kids grow up to be so unhappy. Start now! HAVE A  <br/>\nNICE DAY!!!
