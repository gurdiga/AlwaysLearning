There&#39;s a good question on food here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unschooling.info/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5111\">http://www.unschooling.info/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5111</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe topic is &quot;Can ALL children eat per their body&#39;s needs?&quot;  and one  <br/>\nquote from the body is &quot;I do understand that the radical unschooling  <br/>\napproach to food lets them choose what they want. It&#39;s not meant to  <br/>\n&quot;work&quot; in the sense of them choosing to eat what I&#39;d choose for them.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe could use input, and I&#39;d like to see it all in one place!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other request is for an analogy for a list of 100 (my fantasy  <br/>\ngoal) for why unschooling might not work.  I was hoping for analogies  <br/>\nfrom all kinds of activities and hobbies and jobs.   What I was  <br/>\nthinking this morning while I was getting up was to have a list of  <br/>\nthings explaining why something might not work, in short phrases, for  <br/>\na matching list.   Like<br/>\nUnschooling might not work because you haven&#39;t stopped teaching.<br/>\nSwimming might not work because you&#39;re still standing in the shallows.<br/>\nThe car might not move because you still have your foot on the clutch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a mind to contribute any of those, please leave them here  <br/>\nand I&#39;ll gather them up.  Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":41433,"nextTopicId":41456}}
