Since living and learning go hand in hand we are less stressed from being forced/coerced by others.  I personally struggled with past traumas for many years till I came to a realisation that the traumas were all around how others crossed my boundaries and forced me into situations I had no control over.  When this happened it was a paradigm shift in my thinking about how my parenting was.  I then have worked dillengently to not force/coerce my kids into MY past &quot;issues.&quot;  JOY is what they need from me and appreciation for their presence. Tolerance and trust are crucial.  Thank you for your wonderful insights on your web site and this group.  It is so wonderful to find others with similar concepts on living.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnna</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Having Issues","postDate":"1256090935","msgId":48072,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE3MURENTYyLTMyNzktNDE3NS05MjI5LUI1NUMxOEIwRjEwMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEFDOTk1MDJGLUU5RjctNEREOS05NkVFLTlFMTkyRkM3RTc2NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGhibG9xZytzMTJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QUM5OTUwMkYtRTlGNy00REQ5LTk2RUUtOUUxOTJGQzdFNzY0QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":48071,"nextInTopic":48073,"prevInTime":48071,"nextInTime":48073,"topicId":48054,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"http://sandradodd.com/issues I used to be a teacher, so...

There were a few years when I was  <br/>\nlearning about the effects of alcoholism on the non-drinking children  <br/>\nand relatives of the alcoholics, and because I went to a meeting every  <br/>\nweek and helped other people understand it I was very definitely the  <br/>\nAdult Child of an Alcoholic.  I was vigilant and self-conscious in the  <br/>\nchoices I made, seeing them all in that light.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had discovered I had a big issue, and I worked through it.  I&#39;m  <br/>\nstill an adult child of an alcoholic, but now the thought comes to  <br/>\nmind two or three times a year, maybe, if someone else doesn&#39;t bring  <br/>\nit up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have lived there.  I could have used it as an excuse for  <br/>\nreactive and irrational behavior, but in working through it bit by  <br/>\nbit, I also started to see what was a natural part of me and not  <br/>\ncaused by my mother&#39;s inconstant and unreliable presence, or by my  <br/>\nfeeling that if I helped her pay her phone bill, and let her borrow my  <br/>\ncar, somehow the alcoholism would be gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I had children, I consciously worked on those issues so the  <br/>\nproblem wouldn&#39;t passed on to them, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther parents have other issues, about abuse or neglect or bereavement  <br/>\nor religion or guilt or higher education or class or race or body  <br/>\nimage.   For the purposes of unschooling, those are the things the  <br/>\nparents need to deal with directly and quickly, with professional help  <br/>\nif necessary (at least indirect professional help--books, groups,  <br/>\nwebpages) to get clear what is a natural part of you and what is odd  <br/>\nemotional rashes and baggage.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, while the issues are being examined, be attentive and sweet  <br/>\nto your children.  That might be one of your best healing tools.  It  <br/>\nhelped me immensely, and I&#39;ve seen it help some others.  Don&#39;t justify  <br/>\nreactionary treatment of your children by saying &quot;Well, I was raped so  <br/>\nthey will be&quot;; &quot;I overate so they will&quot;;  &quot;I was forced to go to  <br/>\nchurch so they will never see the inside of a church ever.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a parent&#39;s choices are based on being the same or being the  <br/>\nopposite of parents or of anyone else, they&#39;re reacting.  Sometimes in  <br/>\na healing phase that can help. It can help to have role  models.  It  <br/>\ncan help to have bad examples, marked like crime scenes in our  <br/>\nmemories, to remind us.   Let the reactions be part of a temporary  <br/>\nhealing phase, though.  Let reactions be a stepping stone toward  <br/>\nmindful actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the issues are identified and dealt with, let them fade into  <br/>\noccasional memory, not constant reminder.   Don&#39;t label yourself in  <br/>\nways that hurt your children.  Don&#39;t declare yourself to have a  <br/>\nhandicap and keep that for life as a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card that  <br/>\nyou play when you were irresponsible and want to whine, &quot;Yeah, but...&quot;  <br/>\nand not be a mindful adult.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled kids can&#39;t have irresponsible parents and still have the  <br/>\nfull benefit of unschooling.  Being a good unschooling parent involves  <br/>\nbeing a good person, a good parent.  Unschooling can&#39;t work unless the  <br/>\nparent is there, whole and attentive and not screwing it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48064,"nextTopicId":48075}}
