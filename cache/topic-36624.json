It&#39;s not that I was an unattentive<br/>\nparent, it&#39;s just that Chamille was an easy child.  When Margaux came<br/>\nalong I was already into unschooling and had to relearn how to be<br/>\nattentive and patient because of the kind of kid she was/is.  Chamille<br/>\nbenefitted from that change in my parenting too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s like I had the unschooling down, and then grew into all the other<br/>\naspects that make unschooling work well.

For this list, you act as the attentive parent and we all have choice in reading and replying. You may sometimes feel like you are being a bad guy but I think that happens when one is an attentive parent. You aren&#39;t rude or controlling and are a great role model for me in the way you communicate. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that many of us are used to controlling parents who aren&#39;t attentive, and are trying to not treat our kids the way we were treated. If people get defensive, it isn&#39;t your problem and you shouldn&#39;t take it personally. But if you do, that is something that we all feel at times, and you are still a role model in how you handle it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Mom,<br/>\nJae<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":267847069,"authorName":"J Geller","from":"&quot;J Geller&quot; &lt;gellerjh@...&gt;","profile":"topiecat","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Should I change the list description?","postDate":"1216347175","msgId":36645,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTEyNC1EUzNBRDg3REVENURDNzlCQjcyMzk5OEQ4ODkwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDREIwNzg4LTEzMDItNEI5MS05OTRFLURGRjQ0MjJFMjM3NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEJBWTEyNC1EUzYwN0ExNTA4OUNCQ0ZENzQ2NUM4QkQ4OEUwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDxDNUU1MDEwMy0zMDJDLTQzNTMtOUIyMy0yRUY5NkQ3NDgwN0RAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDNDREIwNzg4LTEzMDItNEI5MS05OTRFLURGRjQ0MjJFMjM3NEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPEJBWTEyNC1EUzYwN0ExNTA4OUNCQ0ZENzQ2NUM4QkQ4OEUwQHBoeC5nYmw+IDxDNUU1MDEwMy0zMDJDLTQzNTMtOUIyMy0yRUY5NkQ3NDgwN0RAc2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":36644,"nextInTopic":36649,"prevInTime":36644,"nextInTime":36646,"topicId":36624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Was that there all along and I missed it or did you just do it?

I do like the idea of having you include local links on your website or something. There has been talk recently about where people are from and I include my city under my name most of the time. I came to this list because our local unschoolers list seemed to be trying to be so inclusive that it had lost the principles of unschooling and had become radical unschooling unfriendly. I had never considered myself a real unschooler until I realized that I had way more in common with the radical unschoolers than with anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you said in a previous email, you can&#39;t be responsible for people feeling welcome.
