If parents have a good relationship with their child, they talk about drugs in an informative way, they talk about their own experiences, and provide their opinions (without the expectation that their child will agree with it). It&#39;s not like they hand their kid a joint, but they do (and I&#39;ve seen this) say &quot;If you are going to experiment, I&#39;d rather you do it at home. If you are out, though, and you need help, you can call me and I&#39;ll come get you&quot; or provide whatever other help they need. Kids make mistakes!

The urgency I have been feeling was made even greater. We are on a great path and I see my relationship with my 14 year old son really doing better and better. The book Parent/Teen Breakthrough and this page and the Yahoo groups have been so beneficial as well as Sandra&#39;s site and Living Joyfully. I have learned so much. Even though his life of relaxed/eclectic homeschooling seemed like freedom to most who observed, I can see how it was not the relationship centered lifestyle that would develop the most peace and joy in my home. He&#39;s my youngest. My husband runs his business out of our home.

The thing is, we haven&#39;t stopped him from these things but have shared our views. So for example, right now it&#39;s pretty vulgar rap music which his sister is offended by. He has gotten pretty good at playing it less around her. He&#39;ll share videos with me and we&#39;ll talk about them. He thinks they&#39;re funny.

I don&#39;t (I&#39;m a bit of a Rock n Roll snob and don&#39;t hear enough guitars!) but we can have good conversations.

Now these kids are not hanging out at someones house. They ride around looking for good things to jump off of. They range in ages and experiences and levels of drug use from none to some to probably a lot. Stevie tells me about it. He probably doesn&#39;t tell me all about it. He knows our family history (lots of addiction on both sides) and how fearful I have been for my kids in that area. He hasn&#39;t tried anything (yet) and I think it is mostly because he thinks he&#39;ll get caught and is worried about it hurting me. I have shifted my conversation to things like your body is still growing and I would love it if you waited until adulthood to experiment with things like that. I posted on &quot;My Unschooler is Interested in...&quot; on Facebook and got so much feedback that I have shared resources with him about drugs. We have watched videos together.

He was gentle and loving.  <br/>\nHe loved the children ...-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nAll true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso true (well, &quot;equally true&quot;):  Jesus told his disciples to leave  <br/>\ntheir families and follow him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI found something with lots of references.  I don&#39;t want to look them  <br/>\nall up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first striking thing for anyone prepared to read the gospels is  <br/>\nthat Jesus was no supporter of family values. He rejected his mother  <br/>\nmore than once, just as he rejected the rest of his family. He had no  <br/>\nqualms about taking his disciples away from their families. The  <br/>\nbrothers James and John abandoned their father, leaving him to manage  <br/>\nas best he could with the fishing nets they had been preparing  <br/>\ntogether. On one occasion, a disciple asked permission to go and bury  <br/>\nhis dead father: &quot;But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead  <br/>\nbury the dead&quot; (Matthew 8:22 c/f Luke 9:60). Jesus then refused  <br/>\nanother potential follower who asked permission to say good-bye to his  <br/>\nfamily before abandoning them (Luke 9:61-62). This attitude was  <br/>\nentirely in line with Jesus&#39; purpose: &quot;For I am come to set a man at  <br/>\nvariance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and  <br/>\nthe daughter in law against the mother in law&quot; (Matthew 10:35). Jesus  <br/>\nconsistently taught that his followers should abandon and despise  <br/>\ntheir families. Everlasting life is promised to those who leave their  <br/>\nhomes and families (Matthew 19:29, Mark 10:29-30 and Luke 18:29-30).  <br/>\nThe Luke author gives Jesus&#39; summary of his views on family life: &quot;If  <br/>\nany man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and  <br/>\nchildren, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he  <br/>\ncannot be my disciple&quot; (Luke 14:26, Cf. Matthew 19:29).<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone picks and chooses what to believe, no matter how much they  <br/>\ndeny it.  No one follows everything in the Bible, which is good.  <br/>\nThere&#39;s a lot of sex and violence to gloss over to get to the  <br/>\npeace&#39;n&#39;love parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":346810200,"authorName":"sunya silverthorn","from":"sunya silverthorn &lt;themrsfish@...&gt;","profile":"suncee37","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas","postDate":"1235419743","msgId":42421,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJBWTExMi1XNDkxQzJENjg2MTQ5NDhEREQ1NTQ3NUNFQUUwQHBoeC5nYmw+","inReplyToHeader":"PDlDNDZCQjQ0MzUxODQ4OEI5QUI0RTY0NjQ0MDFCQTU3QFNoYXJvblBDPg==","referencesHeader":"PDlDNDZCQjQ0MzUxODQ4OEI5QUI0RTY0NjQ0MDFCQTU3QFNoYXJvblBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":42403,"nextInTopic":42424,"prevInTime":42420,"nextInTime":42422,"topicId":42398,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi Sharon, (I ve been reading this list for a while now and this is my first response, so I hope that I have posted correctly) One of the persuasions that led","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1432707233\">Hi Sharon,<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n(I&#39;ve been reading this list for a while now and this is my first response, so I hope that I have posted correctly)<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the persuasions that led me to unschooling was looking at Jesus&#39; example.  He lived life with the disciples, he would answer their questions, he would share stories of how to live life. He was gentle and loving. He loved the children and when the children came to him he did not turn them away. He would answer questions of people and would help them yet he never forced himself on anyone, it was their choice in which direction they would go, he was there to guide and help. He wanted people to come to him out of their own free will, not because they had to.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling to me is guiding our children by taking part in their childhood, to be here when they have questions, to be gentle and loving, help to inspire their curiosity by strewing all kinds of fun things. Being part of their lives and enjoying all kinds of fun adventures with them.  Making sure their needs are met and if a need hasn&#39;t been met then find ways of meeting that need.  Being an active participant in their lives and being available to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve/we&#39;ve been deschooling/unschooling since June of last year and in this period of time my daughter 13 has opened up more and she laughs and jokes more. She is gentle and kind. She now reads for pleasure, this is a miracle in itself. Our relationship has become very close, she comes to me now instead of friends for advice and answers and we have a lot of fun together.  My son 9 took to unschooling like a fish to water, he loves doing all kinds of things and he helps keep me in shape by doing a lot of hiking, walking, playing, gardening, ect. He and his sister are best buddies they have &quot;sleep overs&quot; at least 2 times a week. It&#39;s been wonderful to see the joy that comes with unschooling and our family has embraced this joy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps Sharon,<br/>\n<br/>\nBest whishes on your discussion and I love the title you&#39;ve chosen to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuncee <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:loveinthehouse@...\">loveinthehouse@...</a><br/>\nDate: Mon, 23 Feb 2009 08:14:15 -0800<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Ideas<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be speaking on unschooling to a group of very conservative mothers in March and I was wondering of ideas to make the message &quot;hearable&quot; without compromising.
