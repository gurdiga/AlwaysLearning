The unschoolers in the group were trying to point out the fallacy of over and insincere praise, and indirectly about treating your children as people first. After much talk getting nowhere, one of the other unschooling parents turned to me and in the French poodle voice started thanking me for all the things I had done for the group that day. Something like,&quot;Oh Dan, thank you for bringing the stove for hot cocoa. You did such a good job setting it up and heating the water! You&#39;re so strong carrying that big jug of water all by yourself!&quot; Everyone had a good laugh and the point was succinctly made.<br/>\n<br/>\n(It was Pam Sorooshian who said what he&#39;s quoting, that day at their meet-up, to demonstrate.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- It recognizes that we all get disregulated sometimes-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Disregulated is another two-steps-from-clarity term.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe should not be &quot;regulated&quot; in the first place, so to be &quot;disregulated&quot; is far, far from making a thoughtful decision.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/self-regulation\">http://sandradodd.com/self-regulation</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422674740","msgId":75516,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI2OTkwQkU3LUIxQzYtNDRGQS1CMDBGLTIwRTc1RTIzRDNCNUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQkg2eDBPaWU9K2FnYVRyUExvenU2WUNlT2FEREg1aWV3RDE0S3JxV1ZuWURFTVRiUUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":75498,"nextInTopic":75517,"prevInTime":75515,"nextInTime":75517,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-No. I am not asking in the form of a question.

I used those words to describe what I did. I did not quote myself intentionally because there are many different ways in which I might go about verbalizing what I want. I was trying to be brief. It was a brief sentence to get the point across that I use my voice/words to communicate to my child about not being hit. An actual example might be &quot;Stop, I do not want to be hit&quot; or &quot;Do not hit me&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want you to hit me&quot; all of those are examples of how I might &quot;verbalize&quot; to him that I do not want to be hit. There are times when I have started by validating his feelings and then told him to stop or redirected him. &quot;I can see you&#39;re really angry and I don&#39;t want to be hit&quot;, &quot;Wow, you&#39;re really angry, hit the pillow instead&quot;.

He was asked to stop hitting. </div><div><br></div><div>In regards to using the word &quot;less&quot;, I mean that in terms of over-all. I want less hitting and name calling over-all, So, over all, I&#39;m asking for (read requesting) more of what I want and less of what I don&#39;t want. I also don&#39;t see it as an absolute, No hitting or name calling again, ever. That seems unrealistic and dominant paradigm.

The way I read it, her daughter was getting very frustrated and yelling at her Mom and blaming her for things going wrong or being ruined. Tamara was finding it difficult to stay calm and respond without yelling back. She wanted some suggestions of some things she could do instead. She also wanted to change the dynamic because she saw a pattern repeating and wanted to stop the cycle. That was how I perceived what I read. <i>I</i> used the word abuse because sometimes being in a stressful situation with lots of emotions, being yelled at can feel like abuse (especially if you&#39;re in that mindset) when it might really be a very frustrated child that could use some empathy and understanding and later, coaching. I also don&#39;t want to negate the possibility that <i>she</i> feels that it <i>is</i> abusive. That is up to her to decide.

They are equally valid responses depending on the moment and the child. I don&#39;t think anyone who wants to take a more peaceful approach is wrong for doing so and it is still possible to be &quot;solid&quot; AND reassure your child that you have some understanding and empathy for their feelings. Saying &quot;Well, sweetie, I understand that you might be feeling frustrated, but your sister doesn&#39;t want to be hit and when you yell it hurts mommy&#39;s ears, so please find a way to be more peaceful&quot; does not justify anyone&#39;s actions, or deny bullying behavior. It recognizes that we all get disregulated sometimes and need help getting back to center without shaming a child for having feelings they weren&#39;t able to manage in that moment. (which can often make matters worse) It&#39;s not calling it right that they hit either. </div><div style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-size:13px;\">~But the original question, I think, is a child hitting and yelling at his own mom at home. If she just lets it go by without suggesting alternatives (which I&#39;m not saying you do, which I am saying at least one poster has indicated that she does sometimes), It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be a good unschooling-partnership example to encourage in a discussion such as this one.~<br></div><div style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-size:13px;\">IF you are referring to me being the &quot;one poster&quot;. I did not indicate that I did not suggest alternatives. Other people were already making suggestions of that nature. I was simply offering a different perspective on the mindset she could choose during the yelling that might help her stay focused and calm (and not get triggered and yell back) so that she could actually attempt to put into action whatever method she then chose to implement to remedy the situation. I was trying to offer something that might be a helpful piece of the puzzle. Not a total solution, but something that might aide in the implementing of her chosen solution.  </div><div style=\"font-size:13px;\"><br></div><div style=\"font-size:13px;\">Mindset can make a huge difference in staying calm instead of reactionary.

Instead of<br/>\n helping a child be at peace in the world, some parents hope the world will<br/>\n accommodate the child&#39;s actions, instead of helping him out-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a typo; sorry:  &quot;some parents hlpe the world will&quot; should have been &quot;hope.&quot; <br/>\nAnd the last &quot;helping him out&quot; referred to parents, not to the world.  It could have been worded more carefully.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Every time I read something like this I feel angry. My son has Asperger&#39;s. It is a lifelong disability. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m sorry your son has Asperger&#39;s.

IF a parent is NOT helping a child to be at peace in the world, and IF a parent is not helping the child out, THEN I think they&#39;re using the condition or label or disability or unfortunate circumstance as a justification for not coaching the child to do better.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-He is learning with time (he is 12 now) how to better manage himself and has learnt to calm himself down to an extent, and gaining more and more insight into his own and other people&#39;s feelings and behaviour; we talk a lot and I help him in many ways every single day and life can be hard for him and us all.  -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you expressed anger even though my statement didn&#39;t apply to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-If a child has a physical disability no one would suggest that  a parent is justifying their child&#39;s limitation(s) because he or she has a disability. It is exactly the same with Asperger&#39;s. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a parent whose child has a disability chooses to homeschool and the parent does not help the child compensate for and live well with that limitation, then perhaps the child would be better off in school with professionals.   If a parent does not have the desire or the will or the ability to help a child, homeschooling might not be a good idea.   <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a child for ANY reason is yelling or hitting people in the family, the way the parent responds in the moment, and over time, could make the difference between a future marriage and career, or frustration, running away, prison.   This is true with or without government actions.   <br/>\n<br/>\nStating that Asperger&#39;s is &quot;a lifelong disability&quot; and &quot;rightly so&quot; might cause some people to relax and decide that their child has no choice, and can&#39;t learn to be better—that age and experience won&#39;t help, because it&#39;s lifelong, and it&#39;s a disability, and so the parent might not bother to coach and advise and assist so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome parents take that stance because of divorce, or genetics, or religious rejection of a trait in a child, or because they want to be the mother of a gifted child or an indigo child, and so they stand by and smile, or stand by and scowl, because they don&#39;t want to or they don&#39;t know how to or they are unwilling to guide a child, as a partner, into acceptable, helpful, generous interpersonal paths.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople can be as mad or self-justifying or as political or as religious as they want to be, and reject or enable their children&#39;s behavior as they want to.  Meanwhile, what I intend to continue to do for people who want to be unschoolers in the way it&#39;s discussed here, is to encourage them to be each child&#39;s partner, to help him live peacefully and joyfully, and to learn in his own way as happily and as richly as they can arrange for it to happen.   <br/>\n<br/>\nYour child is twelve.  I&#39;ve been helping other people see and understand unschooling for nearly twenty four years now.  Some in person (local weekly meet-ups, when my kids were young), some who came to visit or to a conference, and many online have had children they or professionals had identified as Asperger&#39;s.  Some were helped more by the parents than others.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had never seen a parent justify bad behavior and say &quot;oh well, it can&#39;t be helped&quot; when the child could have been helped, or others could have been less affected, I wouldn&#39;t even have the idea in my mind.  I&#39;ve seen a range of great, good, not great relationships, and I&#39;ve seen how they affect the unschooling environment in the family and the peace and development of the individuals and their siblings.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen hands-off, hands-up parents use various justifications for not helping a child do better.  I&#39;ve seen them blame other things, other people.  I don&#39;t like to see it recommended in discussions I&#39;ve organized and invited people to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":494160111,"authorName":"","from":"jwaller222@...","profile":"jwaller222","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422452147","msgId":75477,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG1hYW81bCthNW9jcWtAWWFob29Hcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PG1hYW0xMSsxYnQ5NmVsQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":75476,"nextInTopic":75478,"prevInTime":75476,"nextInTime":75478,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, I don t think that Sandra stated that Asperger s does not exist or cannot be the root of certain behavior.

&nbsp;Or offer one or two things, but be mindful of whether your offerings actually do help or exacerbate the situation. &nbsp;With my son, sometimes when he&#39;s feeling really frustrated, my offering a bunch of suggestions on how to fix the situation makes him feel more frustrated. &nbsp;Often he just really wants me to hear how he&#39;s feeling. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t want me to do anything about it—just be there for him. &nbsp;That can be really hard for me because *I* want to help, and if I know I can, that makes it even more difficult to hold back. &nbsp;But if *he* doesn&#39;t want my help, it is rude of me to just go ahead and do it anyway. &nbsp;What he needs is for me to hear him and be okay with his frustration, maybe help him move through the frustration a little more easily just by providing company for him. &nbsp;Respecting his feelings helps set an example for him to learn from. &nbsp;When he feels respected I think it&#39;s easier to treat others with respect as well. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If your daughter is open to the idea, try to be playful. &nbsp;This needs some tact and consideration though. &nbsp;Don&#39;t make fun of the situation, but maybe a well placed &quot;Doh!&quot; or smile or some exaggerated silliness might make things lighter. &nbsp;Some people really don&#39;t like that though, so be mindful, and apologize if it&#39;s not welcome or well received.</div><div><br></div><div>Don&#39;t yell. &nbsp;Just don&#39;t. &nbsp;It really doesn&#39;t work to yell &quot;Don&#39;t yell!&quot; at someone. &nbsp;If you think you&#39;re going to yell, take a washroom break or get a glass of water. &nbsp;Tap dance while you&#39;re alone. &nbsp;Tell yourself jokes. &nbsp;Lighten up. &nbsp;Remind yourself what your goal is—to help your daughter learn what she needs to learn to do what she wants to do, in that moment, and in the future when she&#39;s on her own.</div><div><br></div><div>Karen James&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422412797","msgId":75472,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU1QjVCRkRGLTlEMTktNEJDMS1BODMxLUM2ODJCNDIyRDJBNEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQkg2eDBNUEdGVjZ4U3dlSGYrOEU5Q1orS0JKalh4UkFKLThkdzFQZT1HLWlWMD03UUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"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"},"prevInTopic":75470,"nextInTopic":75473,"prevInTime":75471,"nextInTime":75473,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- ~If your neighbor or a stranger came into your house and hit you or one of your children, would you have verbalized that you do not want to be hit, etc.?~ ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1817528615\">-=-<br/>\n~If your neighbor or a stranger came into your house and hit you or one of your children, would you have verbalized that you do not want to be hit, etc.?~<br/>\n<br/>\nMy child is not a stranger.

With feeling.  Be the lead partner in your relationship.  Take care of your children.

You said, &quot;</span><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">Sometimes yelling IS abusive&quot;. When?

It presumes that there is a result before there is a decision. The word <i>might</i> is key here I think. In which case, I think the answer is because she would not know until she tried. Is this in reference to my comment about what works for me? I would think <i>if </i>things escalated, she might find a different solution. My kids respond well to empathy. If anything, it tends to deescalate matters. Then we can have a calm conversation about what works and what doesn&#39;t and other more desirable options for expressing frustration. IE: It would work better if the child yelled out, but not <i>at</i>.  I think that might fall under &quot;coaching&quot; but I just see it as parenting and automatically part of every process involving raising kids. Perhaps that was the key to my lack of complete details.  </div><div><br></div><div>The idea of changing one&#39;s mindset about a situation can be helpful in staying centered and therefore more capable of having calm conversations and giving advice to your child about options and more socially appropriate responses to feelings.

Instead of helping a child be at peace in the world, some parents hlpe the world will accommodate the child&#39;s actions, instead of helping him out.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=- Meaning that if you let your child be abusive toward you, without coaching otherwise, that they will be abusive to others without realizing that there are consequences to that?-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a child is left to discover that there are consequences to being abusive, how long might that take?  There are things that children might do without legal consequences that will be illegal in a teen or adult, and could result in jailtime or prison.   That&#39;s an extreme example, but these are extremely basic questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I am also curious to know what your ideas are about when yelling becomes abusive.  Frequency? Volume?

It seems if I answer, you might want to use it to justify some action of your own.<br/>\nIf the mother feels abused, she should ask that child to stop, or remove herself from the situation, or get help.<br/>\nIf the mother decides to find ways not to feel abused, in such a fashion that the child might escalate his behavior to get her attention, why would she do that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIntent would be a factor, certainly.  Awareness and expectation could matter.<br/>\n-=-Frequency? Volume? Content/context? -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThat can&#39;t be answered any more than &quot;at what age does it stop being acceptable?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose if the mother has no interest in or ability to coach the child, she might want to hire a coach or counsellor.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy\">http://sandradodd.com/issues/therapy</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":413125980,"authorName":"Sandy Kappa","from":"Sandy Kappa &lt;sandy.kappa@...&gt;","profile":"shineonthewater","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422289197","msgId":75459,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4NzUwRjY1LUEwODItNDU0Mi04OUFBLUI0M0JCRjhBRkVDNEBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75455,"nextInTopic":75461,"prevInTime":75458,"nextInTime":75460,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Ali, you mention a book you use that has techniques for managing big tense feelings before an outburst.

She puts a pencil between her teeth at the most vulnerable time of day.... trying to get out the door.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe heard it on a TED talk about changing your body stance to reflect where you want to be. The speaker, who is a professor in an MBA program, says that taking a pose like spreading your arms can help you feel more powerful. She also mentioned that the presence of an object in your mouth forces you to smile, making it hard to get angry. Not only that it keeps said little kids curious enough to get their boots on. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother mom told me she was starting to lose it with her daughter while she was brushing another daughter&#39;s hair. She poured her focus into the soft brown locks, and it kept the anger at a distance. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a time in Odhner history when I knew I had to be at the local library at four o&#39;clock. Every day. The librarian probably thought I was an over achieving mother of preschoolers, exposing them to books often and eagerly. But it was a survival tactic. If we were home in the late afternoon, bedlam would erupt. If we were in a public place, we held it together. Then by five I could trundle them home in my bike cart and drop the kids in a pile of Legos while I rustled up supper. <br/>\n<br/>\nI applaud such proactive measures. We are generally smart enough to put on coats when it is twenty degrees outside. There are ways to protect us from unfriendly interactions as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne time John and I were just beginning to clash about something that is no longer of any consequence, and he tossed me an appreciation. It was like a pencil between my teeth. I had to smile. Another time we were arguing when he noticed our son, who was supposed to be vacuuming the floor, was sucking up Cheerios one by one. And laughing. Our angst flew out the window. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love that the content of the disagreements have long ago expired, but the peacemaking attempts are still fresh in my memory. <br/>\nLove, <br/>\n<br/>\nLori<br/>\nLori Odhner<br/>\nCaring for Marriage<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://archive.aweber.com/marriagemoats/9zGf5/h/Marriage_Moats_Pencil_in_My.htm\">http://archive.aweber.com/marriagemoats/9zGf5/h/Marriage_Moats_Pencil_in_My.htm</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":310848040,"authorName":"Ali Zeljo","from":"Ali Zeljo &lt;azeljo@...&gt;","profile":"azeljo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422287306","msgId":75454,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQxQjkzNzYwLTc2MEEtNEQ4NC04RThDLTgzNTJBMTFENTIyNUBnbWFpbC5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PEY3QUMxRjM0LTVCRTUtNEZFNi1BRDQ0LUNDMzkwODBDQkE5MkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG05dDRnZysxbzlhbGZzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4gPDEwNzY0Mjc3MDkuMTY5OTM5LjE0MjIyMDU3MTkwMDQuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob29AbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+IDxDQUJINngwTUxubzQ1RzlFUnJvVT1MRzk1K29IeWoyU0ZXZkpKdmZuaFVESm1BcUc9dmdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+IDxGN0FDMUYzNC01QkU1LTRGRTYtQUQ0NC1DQzM5MDgwQ0JBOTJAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75453,"nextInTopic":75455,"prevInTime":75453,"nextInTime":75455,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

He has explosive anger fits and he seeks me out during these times.  I&#39;m grateful that he seeks me out because I do not get offended or reactive to him and so we can work to help him calm down.  My husband often gets drawn in, feels offended and reactive, which isn&#39;t good for either of them.   As my son gets older, I&#39;ve been able to do more coaching.  It&#39;s been a gradual process, but now when he is verbally mean to me because he&#39;s angry from losing a game, I say that I&#39;m not going to take that to heart.  I&#39;ll wait for you to calm down.  He hears me and is usually able to calm himself within a minute and apologizes for his meanness.  We&#39;ve come a long way.  He used to jump at me and physically attack me.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAlways part of his anger outburst is a demand for food, so I do think blood sugar is part of it.  I&#39;m not sure if some losses are manageable simply because his blood sugar is stable and others are not because of hunger?   Or maybe it&#39;s that a huge disappointing loss uses up a lot of energy and there&#39;s an immediate need for food right away.  Bringing regular snack trays is part of the solution for us.  Me always trusting that he will learn to manage these big frustration outbursts has been really important.  I approach it like a partnership.  I&#39;m the stability during the outburst, and I give him feedback afterwards.  He&#39;s old enough to understand and work on it now.  He&#39;s 11.  We have a book for kids that explains techniques that people can use to manage that big tense feeling before an outburst.  At this point, years into working on his anger, I can even suggest some of the techniques when his anger is rising.  This is because I&#39;m a trustworthy partner.  I&#39;m not reactive and I stay calm when he is getting angry.  He has learned to go away and read a book with a snack.  He can calm himself down a good deal of the time.  It&#39;s pretty amazing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAli</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":532773099,"authorName":"Jorie Denny","from":"Jorie Denny &lt;joriedenny@...&gt;","profile":"twostorie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422261129","msgId":75452,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBQkg2eDBPUWY5T2QzbmNVS21IT3htK2YtZDl1YT1nbitfcXRDVFJRVWNvVXRkcy1wZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBQkg2eDBORVkxR2NYV2dtVURuRFExQkFtOXBwejVNNTN5YnJRNXpmdnFTLUxodk9rZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PG05dDRnZysxbzlhbGZzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4JPDEwNzY0Mjc3MDkuMTY5OTM5LjE0MjIyMDU3MTkwMDQuSmF2YU1haWwueWFob29AbWFpbC55YWhvby5jb20+CTxDQUJINngwTUxubzQ1RzlFUnJvVT1MRzk1K29IeWoyU0ZXZkpKdmZuaFVESm1BcUc9dmdAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+CTxGN0FDMUYzNC01QkU1LTRGRTYtQUQ0NC1DQzM5MDgwQ0JBOTJAU2FuZHJhZG9kZC5jb20+CTxDQUJINngwTkVZMUdjWFdnbVVEbkRRMUJBbTlwcHo1TTUzeWJyUTV6ZnZxUy1MaHZPa2dAbWFpbC5nbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":75451,"nextInTopic":75453,"prevInTime":75451,"nextInTime":75453,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"~Sometimes yelling IS abusive.~ I am also curious to know what your ideas are about when yelling becomes abusive.

When my kids have gotten more extreme, like name calling or hitting, I have asked for more kindness and less name calling or whatever the issue, and have verbalized that I do not want to be hit, etc. There are limits to what I want to accept for myself and I imagine everyone has different limits along those lines. I noticed that the previous commenter had already mentioned some helpful ideas, including verbalizing her request to not be yelled at, leaving the situation, etc. I was trying not to be redundant, but offer a different perspective. Is it your opinion that what Tamara is describing IS abusive? The way I read it, her child seemed to be expressing a lot of frustration through anger and blame. Strategies that don&#39;t seem to be working for Tamara.  I have found that sometimes when I am triggered, it is not as much about what&#39;s happening as my <i>thoughts</i> about what&#39;s happening. When I am able to shift my thoughts about it, I can stay centered and access my higher brain functions as apposed to being in a fight or flight mode. <div><br></div><div>You mentioned that some overflow is acceptable with younger children.

We&#39;ll watch a funny show while we have cocoa and then he goes back to the game refreshed and calmer.<br>  </div><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3661\" style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\"> <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3660\" style=\"font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;\"> <div id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3676\" class=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225y_msg_container\"> <hr id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3691\" size=\"1\"><font id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3658\" size=\"2\" face=\"Arial\"><b id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3657\"><span id=\"ygrps-yiv-531872225yui_3_16_0_1_1422204650232_3656\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"></span></b></font><br></div> </div> </div>  </div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":333388203,"authorName":"","from":"rinelle@...","profile":"rinelle2011","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Getting angry at people who are helping","postDate":"1422005584","msgId":75441,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PG05dDRnZysxbzlhbGZzQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":75449,"prevInTime":75440,"nextInTime":75442,"topicId":75441,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Lately my daughter (10), has been frequently asking for help, and then when it either isn t done the way she wants, is impossible, or something goes wrong,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1724685655\"><div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1724685655ygrps-yiv-1169476194\"><p><span style=\"line-height:1.25;word-spacing:normal;\">Lately my daughter (10), has been frequently asking for help, and then when it either isn&#39;t done the way she wants, is impossible, or something goes wrong, yelling at me and blaming me. </span><br></p><p><br></p><p>For example, today she&#39;s been really interested in pottery, using a kids pottery wheel she has. It&#39;s a really difficult skill, and one I don&#39;t know much about, so there has been a lot of frustration. She has asked me to get the clay centred for her, then when I&#39;m struggling to do so, she started yelling that I&#39;d ruined it. If I tried to suggest that she try something different (bracing her hands against the side for example), she yells that that won&#39;t work. I suggested looking up some tutorials on YouTube. Again she yelled that she&#39;d tried that, and it had made it harder. A little while later, she asked me to look for some tutorials on YouTube. (These suggestions weren&#39;t all at once, but over the course of the day, she&#39;s been playing with the clay on and off all day.)</p><p><br></p><p>She finally managed to get it centred, and make a small pot, and then she wanted to take it off the wheel. After trying to slide the string under it as she&#39;d seen on YouTube, she asked me to do it for her. I slid the string under, but the clay was still too soft, so I suggested we wait until it had dried a little. At first she said it had to be done right away, so I took a deep breath, and showed her how even putting the string under a little was putting pressure on the pot. She decided we should wait until it had dried a little. Then she started spinning the wheel (I think with the intention of the motion helping dry it faster.) </p><p><br></p><p>Because the pot had been moved a little off centre by our attempts to move it, the spinning pushed it out of shape, so I said to stop, and explained what was happening. My daughter got very upset, and began yelling at me that I&#39;d ruined her pot. </p><p><br></p><p>I understand that she&#39;s upset and frustrated by things not working out the way she wants, but I&#39;m finding it really hard to be yelled at for running things frequently, (This has happened on several occasions over the last week, maybe 4 or 5 times?) and I&#39;m not sure how to respond. I&#39;m trying really hard to stay calm and not yell back (not always successfully!), and would love some things I could do instead. </p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, I do feel the need to do something too change this dynamic, as I can see that it&#39;s making me reluctant to do things with her or help her when asked. I&#39;m finding myself pulling back from this sort of activity for fear that it will end up making us both upset, and I really don&#39;t want to do that. (And I&#39;m sure my daughter can sense my reluctance, and it&#39;s making the situation worse.) </p><p><br></p><p>Both of us really enjoy craft (and both have very definite ideas on the best way to do something!) and I want to be able to enjoy this activity, not it be a source of conflict.</p><p><br></p><p><span></span></p><p>Tamara </p><p><span><br class=\"ygrps-yiv-1724685655ygrps-yiv-1169476194yui-cursor\"></span></p></div></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":75482,"nextTopicId":75532}}
