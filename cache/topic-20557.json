I, also, get so frustrated at the lack of<br/>\nspontaneous play allowed for children. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven in the realm of homeschoolers, I get back-to-school blues due to<br/>\nthe mostly school-at-home thinking.  I would not and could not change my<br/>\nway of thinking, but there is a great deal of disparity between what I<br/>\nthink would be &#39;ideal&#39; for my children&#39;s learning.  Our family is rather<br/>\nisolated due to unschooling, but we would benefit greatly from more IRL<br/>\ninteraction with similar-minded people.  I know my children would<br/>\nbenefit from more interaction with other children; but I just haven&#39;t<br/>\nfound it much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am finding myself likely to have great distances form in some<br/>\n(more)friendships because they are choosing the school route, which<br/>\npulls them away from us by time, as well as by way of thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am trying to think creatively about this.
