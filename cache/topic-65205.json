Through the years while the boys were little we had all sorts of sleeping arrangements. My oldest slept in the bed with me and DH until my second son came along. Then we slept (for a number of years) in two separate rooms.  I was in one room with one child, and hubby in another room with the other.  For the last few years we have all been in one room. Hubby and I sleep in the king sized bed and my boys have bunk beds in our room. Still, at times ,my youngest likes to come into our bed because he wants to cuddle (and falls asleep there) . At different times the boys have talked about &#39;someday&#39; moving into a room together. So far that has not happened because one or the other of them still wants to be in our room, so the other decides to stay too.  A couple of weeks ago (while we were on vacation ) my oldest son mentioned that he might be ready to have his own room.  He is a light sleeper and is prone to having someone in the room accidently wake him up. He feels he would get better sleep by himself. I told him I would be happy to help arrange that for him and that we could figure out which room he would like to use, etc., when we returned from our vacation.  We&#39;ve been back a week now and the subject hasn&#39;t been brought up again (smile) so I may ask him if he is still thinking of moving into his own space....whatever he wants is fine. Maybe he will try it out and change his mind and come back to our room. I have found that having them in the room until they feel ready to have their own space (or not) has given us all a sense of security . It started because it made sense from a nursing standpoint to co-sleep.  It felt safe and comfortable to have the babies close and made things easier. As the months (and then years) ticked by there seemed no reason to change. We never suffered the anxiety of letting them &#39;cry it out&#39; so they could learn to sleep in their own rooms. The boys never suffered anxiety about sleeping alone or were worried about scary things in the closet (I remember going to my mother&#39;s room every night for YEARS because i was afraid of the dark or what was in my closet). Now  my boys  are thinking of moving into their own space but its their idea. I support whatever they are comfortable with at this point. I have no regrets about the co-sleeping.  Soon enough they will have their own lives and their own families and their own homes. For our family this arrangement has been a positive one and I would do things the exact same way if I had more children.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":173560398,"authorName":"sebrina w","from":"&quot;sebrina w&quot; &lt;sunmamma@...&gt;","profile":"sebrinawilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Additional Co-Sleeping Question...","postDate":"1327407167","msgId":65226,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGpmbTc3dittaTJjQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGpmam9hYis0a3M0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":65224,"nextInTopic":65227,"prevInTime":65225,"nextInTime":65227,"topicId":65205,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I have 4 kids ages 11, 10, 8 and 5 and my experience has been that at about 9-10 both my older boys stopped coming to us at night.

Five of us<br/>\nin one bed was rare - it just wasn&#39;t comfortable for anybody, really. But<br/>\nwe had a mattress on the floor beside our bed for years and it wasn&#39;t<br/>\nuncommon for the kids to fall asleep in our bed and then be moved to the<br/>\nmattress to sleep all night. Sleeping alone in their own beds started<br/>\nhappening off and on as they got to be around five years old...they&#39;d be<br/>\ntired and we&#39;d go into their room and snuggle up on their bed to read<br/>\ntogether or sing or talk and they&#39;d fall asleep. Often they&#39;d get up in the<br/>\nnight and get into our bed, though. And then sometimes, in a while, I would<br/>\nmove them back to their bed if ours got too hot and crowded &lt;G&gt;. Or I would<br/>\nmove to their bed, myself. Sometimes my husband would move to one of the<br/>\nkid&#39;s beds if a kid was restless. I did usually keep the kids sleeping on<br/>\nthe side of me away from my husband because I seemed able to handle<br/>\nsuddenly flailing elbows or feet - would stop them gently and it didn&#39;t<br/>\ndisturb me too much -  but the kids seemed to inevitably whack him right in<br/>\nthe face or some other sensitive spot if they were sleeping between us.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was never a time when I could say the kids always slept in their own<br/>\nbeds. Even after ten or eleven years old there were many times that a kid<br/>\nmight crawl into bed with us during the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never talked with them about any of this. It just all happened very<br/>\nnaturally based on what was comfortable and enjoyable. There were times my<br/>\nhusband needed an undisturbed night&#39;s sleep and I&#39;d make sure he got it by<br/>\nme going to sleep with the kids in another room.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes we fell asleep - all five of us - watching a movie in our<br/>\nbedroom, all squished together in the same bed. Usually I&#39;d wake up<br/>\noverheated and I&#39;d move a kid or two to the mattress on the floor so that<br/>\nwe could all be comfy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed very normal to my husband to have children around us during the<br/>\nnight. He is from Iran and in his home town, at least, entire extended<br/>\nfamilies slept in the one heated room during the winter and on the cooler<br/>\nroof in the summer. They had thick mats that were rolled up during the day<br/>\nand pulled out to sleep on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy 27-year-old is married and lives in her own house (around the corner<br/>\nfrom ours).

My twin daughters co-slept until about 4. When they were about 18 months old, I got them beds for their room. They picked out their own special sheets with their favorite characters on them, and we put all their stuffed animals in the beds. They loved it! They napped in there during the day, initially. I would lay in the bed and &quot;nurse them down&quot;. Eventually, after they weaned a few months later, they started napping in there by choice because they felt secure. They were never pushed. We read stories and enjoyed back rubs and such. By about 2 1/2, I started incorporating their beds into our night time routine. Same thing...bath, stories in their beds, back rubs, etc. At first, I only did this maybe once or twice a week. No rush. When they woke up during the night in their natural rhythm, they would climb in my bed (I put LOTS of night lights in the outlets between their room and mine). This lasted until they were 4. They are 7 now, and have had no difficulty at all. I think the gradual, secure change made all the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nMy 2 1/2 year old daughter slept in a co-sleeper initially because my husband worried that he would roll over on her if she were between us. She often slept in my arms on my side of the bed. When she outgrew the co-sleeper, we bought a small kids&#39; mattress at Ikea to put on the floor next to our bed. She would either sleep there or in my arms. For Christmas, she got a toddler bed that we decked out in her favorite princess sheets. She was SO EXCITED about her princess bed. It is in the corner of our bedroom. She loves sleeping there. She often crawls in bed with me during the night. Because she is little, and her natural sleep pattern still causes her to wake up during the night, I&#39;m in no rush to move her into the big girls&#39; room. I don&#39;t want them to be disturbed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of this might help you! &lt;3<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKim <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: AshleahD &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:ashleah_dumdei@...\">ashleah_dumdei@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: AlwaysLearning &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;<br/>\nSent: Mon, Jan 23, 2012 8:52 am<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Additional Co-Sleeping Question...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n    <br/>\n                  <br/>\nI was reading the co-sleeping question, but I have an additional question...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m the mother to 3 co-sleeping boys (4, 2 and 3 months).
