I check on him frequently, look up walkthroughs, discuss his games and watch him play some. I always applaud his achievements (when he beats a boss). Being enthusiastic about interests no matter what they are, does a lot for your child&#39;s self esteem. If I am busy, I always take at least a few minutes out of what I&#39;m doing to listen (my son talks about his games quite often so I have a lot of chances). Letting him know you are interested and do care, even though you are busy with the babies, can mean so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son also has female friends that love gaming.

My oldest daughter is very social and loves new experiences, so if we don&#39;t get out of the house for Something Fun at least a couple of times a week, my daughter starts getting squirrelly.  She recently had the chicken pox and we kept her out of the community for a week.  We really only left the house for dog walks, and by the end of that week, school started seeming like a Good Idea to her.  We had 5 days between the time she was no longer contagious and before my 3 yo was likely to be contagious, so we squeezed in about 3 weeks worth of activities into that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to a homeschool 4-H meeting, the children&#39;s museum, and an indoor play gym.  We volunteered at the kids tent at a local festival where my daughter enjoyed helping with face painting.  We went to a parade, had a child sleepover, and attended a dance class and an aikido class.  We also bought the Klutz kit for balloon twisting and brought it to the park where my daughter made balloon swords and hats for every child at the park.  All the kids loved it and my daughter felt very proud of herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring all of this, the baby rode in a front carrier or a backpack carrier or laid out on a blanket.  The 3 yo had lots of snacks, water, and extra toys along, as well as a stroller to retreat to when she got tired or overwhelmed.  Sometimes she stayed home with her dad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly don&#39;t recommend doing this all the time, but even my 7yo is happy to be home relaxing, snuggling, watching TV, cooking, etc, now that the 3 yo has chicken pox and we have another week out of the community before she is no longer contagious.  School has lost all its appeal, but by the end of the week, I&#39;m going to be thinking of some Interesting places to go for our dog walks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting long, but my point is it can be done.  As long as we&#39;re well prepared, and we go somewhere where the kids can move around a lot and be noisy, it seems to be beneficial to All of Us to keep up with my daughter&#39;s active social needs.  Maybe, start with once a week, or twice a month.  Follow your sons interests,  the younger ones will probably enjoy it on some level, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nNikole</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":265299176,"authorName":"k","from":"k &lt;katherand@...&gt;","profile":"katherand2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Logistical question: how to engage curious 10-yo while juggling two babies","postDate":"1285614582","msgId":57515,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGlrZj01RTVfOWlRZ004V3VSTHZ5X0VzcEptaGRnTFJoaE43c2ZpUEBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGk3bTMzcytkMTg2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFCNzI0QTZFLUIxQTctNDE2NC1BNkJELTFDMjFCNTBDQTI3M0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4JPGk3bTMzcytkMTg2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":57512,"nextInTopic":57533,"prevInTime":57514,"nextInTime":57516,"topicId":57483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... don t rule that out.","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1820853502\"><blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been surprised by how well my boys play with girls as well.

Karl can break into the scene with girls easily<br/>\nalthough he&#39;s getting to an age now where subtle changes make befriending<br/>\nboys easier. Part of this is due to the fact that most boys Karl has met<br/>\nwith are a lot older than he is and the girls have been mostly his age,<br/>\nwhich is a key concern of the other kids (who go to school with typical age<br/>\nsegregation). He, by contrast, plays well with toddlers and enjoys it.. he&#39;s<br/>\nvery doting with them, helpful and the mothers always say he is so good with<br/>\nthem. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of our recent decisions is to move and if things work out we will. The<br/>\nbiggest reason is for Karl (and really all of us) to have more social<br/>\nopportunities, as where we currently live is an hour round trip for people<br/>\nto visit us and vice versa, and our old car is a gas guzzler. The other big<br/>\nreason is to free up our time from caring for 13 acres of land constantly in<br/>\nneed of mowing, which would also be socially beneficial.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Katherine<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":188389249,"authorName":"Leah P","from":"&quot;Leah P&quot; &lt;leah_cierra@...&gt;","profile":"leah_cierra","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Logistical question: how to engage curious 10-yo while juggling two babies","postDate":"1285596010","msgId":57512,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk3cTgxYStodnBuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltZEtPVk9PVWFYZE84WDRIPVgtOE5ZZmZXb0pTTStSOUY0RHA3cUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57495,"nextInTopic":57515,"prevInTime":57511,"nextInTime":57513,"topicId":57483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Wow!

I&#39;m not really sure what kind of advice to give you.  It&#39;s easy for someone outside of the situation to tell you that you just need to bring the babies along.  I can sympathize somewhat with you as I run a home daycare while homeschooling.  Recently I&#39;ve started to be able to take all the children out to activities (I only have 2 extra during the day - one is three and the other is two).  It&#39;s not easy to get into a routine of frequent trips with toddlers and even less easy to do it with babies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion to you is a Mother&#39;s Helper.  A Mother&#39;s Helper is such an amazing tool when you are juggling several children.  I would enlist the help of another homeschooler, and have this person start helping around the house with the little one&#39;s first.  Use that opportunity to do more around the house/property stuff with Julian.  You&#39;ll still be there with your babies (I&#39;m not suggesting having someone else take care of your babies, just having someone help you take care of them.  They&#39;ll be still in the same space that you are in.), and your babies will have two more hands to meet their needs, making it easier on you. Once your babies and the Mother&#39;s Helper have become more comfortable with each other, you could start taking outings. The Mother&#39;s Helper for example could sit with you and the 18 month old and follow her around to keep her out of trouble while you help Julian and potentially sling the baby.  I suggest slinging the baby on your back. This frees up your hands for activities with Julian, plus helping/holding the other little one when she needs it.  I&#39;ve also found that slinging babies on my back is more comfortable while hiking and long walks.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly I just want to send you some positive energy and hugs.  I know that there is no easy solution to your problem.  Just enjoy as much as you can and let go of what you can&#39;t.  :)    <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Deborah McKee Kelly &lt;dlmckee@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve posted recently about my 10 yo step-son and his interest in army<br/>\n&gt; stuff.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Today, I have a logistical question.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve got two babies: an 18-month-old girl and a 4-month-old girl.  I&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; warnings from concerned friends and family that I wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt; *teach* Julian with the two babies around.  Because we are on more of an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling path, and because J has lots of interests, I wasn&#39;t too<br/>\n&gt; concerned.  I know that, for instance, my MIL is worried that I can&#39;t stand<br/>\n&gt; at the front of the *school room* and give J lectures on all his *required<br/>\n&gt; subjects* with two babies, and she&#39;s right, I can&#39;t.  Which is fine with me,<br/>\n&gt; because we don&#39;t do school at home anymore.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But I was just re-reading this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; *Excerpt: &quot;...Are you saying you&#39;re never using your own knowledge about<br/>\n&gt; what might interest her, but waiting for her to take the initiative all the<br/>\n&gt; time? That&#39;s too much waiting. I mean, just take the example of games <br/>\n&gt; there are LOTS of times that kids can&#39;t imagine how much fun a game is going<br/>\n&gt; to be, just from looking at the box, for example. If YOU know that she LOVED<br/>\n&gt; Candyland, then you might pick up Chutes and Ladders because it is also<br/>\n&gt; likely to be fun for her  ou don&#39;t need to wait for her to ask for it. She<br/>\n&gt; might never happen to see it and might very likely never realize that it is<br/>\n&gt; a game she&#39;d like a lot. Or maybe she loves CLUE  she&#39;d likely enjoy<br/>\n&gt; MASTERMIND  both involve the same kind of logical thinking. So  how is she<br/>\n&gt; going to know that?**  I&#39;ve heard of unschoolers who say they never bring<br/>\n&gt; home anything for their kids, because they feel that puts subtle pressure on<br/>\n&gt; them to learn what the parents are promoting. I say hogwash to that. I pick<br/>\n&gt; up stuff ALL the time  STILL do it and mine are 14, 18, and almost 21. If I<br/>\n&gt; see an unusual fruit in the grocery store, I buy it and take it home and put<br/>\n&gt; it on the table for others to notice. If a kid is in the store with me I<br/>\n&gt; might say, &quot;Oooh look at this. Let&#39;s take it home and cut it open. (Pam<br/>\n&gt; Sorooshian)&quot; *<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I realized that often, J is kind of left on his own, and he has been<br/>\n&gt; doing this lately: laying on the couch, looking unhappy, sighing loudly,<br/>\n&gt; saying, &quot;I&#39;m booooored.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He has lots of stuff to play with, and every now and then he gets absorbed<br/>\n&gt; in video games or Legos.  But I know he would benefit if I could offer more<br/>\n&gt; of my own time to explore different things with him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I know there are SO many things he and I would be doing together if I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t rushing back and forth between the needs of these two baby girls.  J<br/>\n&gt; wants to do things with me.  We have so often talked about doing this or<br/>\n&gt; that -- his dad even mowed a path in the back part of our 40-acre property,<br/>\n&gt; and we were going to go out there and do a bunch of exploring around the<br/>\n&gt; trees and shrubs and creek, but...the babies make it, if not impossible,<br/>\n&gt; definitely difficult.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t get out of the house much.  Even going down to our library, less<br/>\n&gt; than half a mile down our road, is kind of tricky.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m making excuses -- it&#39;s NOT impossible, like I said.  It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; that both babies are really demanding.  The 18 month old wants what she<br/>\n&gt; wants, when she wants it.  And I follow her lead a lot.  She has the biggest<br/>\n&gt; needs right now, I would say.  Julian is more capable of waiting and<br/>\n&gt; entertaining himself.  The 4-month-old is starting to have bigger needs, but<br/>\n&gt; for now, she&#39;s pretty content to hang out in the bouncy seat.  And I do have<br/>\n&gt; a carrier for her -- but when I have her strapped to my chest, it makes it<br/>\n&gt; difficult to meet the needs of Josephine, the 18-month-old.  (hard to bend<br/>\n&gt; over, lift Josephine up, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As one example, Julian really likes and wants to cook.  He wants me to help<br/>\n&gt; him, and be in the kitchen with him.  However, our kitchen is just not quite<br/>\n&gt; baby-proofed for Josephine, and even if she could be in there with us while<br/>\n&gt; we worked, she would be yanking on my leg for my full attention the whole<br/>\n&gt; time.  Usually when I&#39;m making supper, Julian is in the living room with<br/>\n&gt; her, keeping her company, playing with her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have only one friend nearby (15 minutes away) who is also home-schooling<br/>\n&gt; and who has kids around Julian&#39;s age.  She and her boys are really busy with<br/>\n&gt; activities and such, and it&#39;s been difficult to coordinate schedules.  She<br/>\n&gt; also has one older boy in public high school, and she&#39;s involved in a lot of<br/>\n&gt; carpooling for his sports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Julian is frustrated with the high needs of the babies.  I am trying to be<br/>\n&gt; empathetic about it with him, and just try and love on him and give him my<br/>\n&gt; time when they&#39;re sleeping or otherwise engaged.  But -- you know -- that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty rare.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I struggle with my own expectations, too, because I feel like he has a lot<br/>\n&gt; of independence, which I didn&#39;t get as a child.  I, too, was a lonely child<br/>\n&gt; with few friends my age, but I was trapped by my mom&#39;s fear of everything.<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t go or do anything.  I feel almost jealous of his freedom.  I do<br/>\n&gt; the whole, &quot;Jeez, if I were him I&#39;d be gone -- running the back woods for<br/>\n&gt; hours, riding my bike to the library,&quot; etc. -- which I know is not the way<br/>\n&gt; to look at it, and I NEVER say something like that to him.  He&#39;s not into<br/>\n&gt; that.  He wants a friend with him or he wants me to hang out with him, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had to re-examine my own thought process and not judge him about it.<br/>\n&gt; Ideally, he wants me to adopt a 10-year-old boy (he has asked me to,<br/>\n&gt; actually), so he could have someone to play army with, and run around with.<br/>\n&gt; Seriously, if I could, I would consider it.  I hate seeing him so unhappy<br/>\n&gt; and lonely.  His dad is here all the time, working outside, and Julian knows<br/>\n&gt; he is always welcome to be out there with his dad helping.  Sometimes he<br/>\n&gt; does that.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; We have only one vehicle, and most of the time, I cannot ask my husband to<br/>\n&gt; watch the babies while I do something with Julian, because it cuts into his<br/>\n&gt; work.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Do I need to work harder at moving the babies with us, so Julian and I can<br/>\n&gt; do some engaging things outside the house?  (I know I tend to start<br/>\n&gt; thinking, &quot;oh, that would mean making bottles, and packing the diaper bag,<br/>\n&gt; and dragging the stroller out, and putting seats in the van, and ...&quot; In<br/>\n&gt; other words, making excuses for how hard it would be to do X or Y with the<br/>\n&gt; babies.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ll stop there.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Regards,<br/>\n&gt; Deb<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n&gt; </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Logistical question: how to engage curious 10-yo while juggling two babies","postDate":"1285472661","msgId":57495,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDkxNTc3N0I5LTQ1RTUtNEM2Ny1CRjgxLUU4ODRBRjY2RjgxQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3QkVCQTk0Rjk4MTQ4QTI4Rjc4QTlFOTYzNDFCODIwQEVkUEM+","referencesHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltZEtPVk9PVWFYZE84WDRIPVgtOE5ZZmZXb0pTTStSOUY0RHA3cUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4gPGk3bTU0YytkdmExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QUFOTGtUaT1QLU1iQXcrU3dpb3FCWXluUGgxZnZBUVRLcm5PS0Z1Z1FaR3FFQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPiA8Q0REQjg0MjQtQzA1Qi00MEMyLUI4OTgtMkUyQzY3MUQ3MUVCQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8NzdCRUJBOTRGOTgxNDhBMjhGNzhBOUU5NjM0MUI4MjBARWRQQz4="},"prevInTopic":57494,"nextInTopic":57512,"prevInTime":57494,"nextInTime":57496,"topicId":57483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-They ve gone fishing.-=- That reminds me of the Lyrics Game.

And then here, at our house, he is sort of the odd man<br/>\nout.

He didn&#39;t seem to,<br/>\nuntil just recently.  And then Autumn came, just 14 short months later.  I<br/>\nthink he internalizes a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce, early in my unschooling journey, I wrote a message on here about him<br/>\nwanting a lot of praise and affirmation on things, and I was trying to<br/>\ncontrol that, because I didn&#39;t want him to be so *needy.*  You guys, of<br/>\ncourse, set me straight, and since, I&#39;ve looked at it very differently.  He<br/>\ncraves the reward stickers and the &quot;good job!&quot; stuff, and so I look for ways<br/>\nto meet that need.  Life is hard enough without me trying to make him &quot;grow<br/>\nout of&quot; wanting to be praised.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian and I are real kindred spirits in many ways, and even though I can&#39;t<br/>\nbe the replacement mom, and I&#39;m not trying to, I don&#39;t want to alienate him<br/>\neven more just because these little girls are so needy in their own ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe asks me often, &quot;Why do they cry?  Why do they want what they can&#39;t have?&quot;<br/>\nEtc. with just the slightest edge to his voice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe actually has played WoW since he was five!  :)  His dad is a WoW-aholic,<br/>\nand if anyone ever watched Julian play, they would think he was involved in<br/>\na serious research project.  He sits here with multiple internet tabs open,<br/>\nand takes notes on other characters&#39; armor and stats, etc.  He and his dad<br/>\ndo play together at least once a week, pretty intensely.  I&#39;m going to check<br/>\nout Roblox as someone suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe live in a pretty rural area, but I&#39;m going to keep working at getting<br/>\nsome kids over here, even if they don&#39;t *fit* our concept of the *right*<br/>\nkind of friends.  That&#39;s been one obstacle -- Julian&#39;s dad is fairly strict?<br/>\nuptight? nervous? about getting involved with non-homeschooled kids, or kids<br/>\nwho come from families that aren&#39;t *like-minded.&quot;  Which is kind of silly;<br/>\nwe are in the heart of rural Indiana, and we are basically<br/>\nhydroponic-lettuce-growing atheists, and my husband is not even an American<br/>\ncitizen.  Good luck finding like-minded friends.  I just feel like we live<br/>\nin a place where we can&#39;t afford to be that picky.  Like Sandra said, these<br/>\nkids aren&#39;t moving in; they can come over and hang out and then go home.  No<br/>\nbiggie.  And if they get Julian all excited about going to public school, so<br/>\nbe it.  In some ways -- and I&#39;m not saying this because I don&#39;t love hanging<br/>\nout with him and giving him the unschooling experience -- I think the<br/>\nexperience of being in school, maybe even for a short time, would help him.<br/>\nHe often asks me what school was like when I was little.  It&#39;s hard to know<br/>\nwhat a young person imagines about *school* when they&#39;ve never set foot in<br/>\none.  And then, with this lack of social life with other kids (partly my<br/>\nfault, I know), he sees how easy it is for his older sister to have a dozen<br/>\nfriends to hang out with at any given time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to work on all these suggestions; trading off a baby or a toddler<br/>\nto Dad or sending Julian to hang out with his dad for *non-work* fun, or<br/>\ngetting someone to watch the babies, etc.  I am feeling scared that it would<br/>\nbe easy to let these next couple of years keep on the way they are, with<br/>\nJulian not really having the stimulation or emotional attention he really<br/>\nneeds, and growing further and further from us, all in the comfort of his<br/>\nown home.  How sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to avoid that.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Deb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":154304522,"authorName":"plaidpanties666","from":"&quot;plaidpanties666&quot; &lt;plaidpanties666@...&gt;","profile":"plaidpanties666","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Logistical question: how to engage curious 10-yo while juggling two babies","postDate":"1285461964","msgId":57489,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGk3bTU0YytkdmExQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGltZEtPVk9PVWFYZE84WDRIPVgtOE5ZZmZXb0pTTStSOUY0RHA3cUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":57488,"nextInTopic":57490,"prevInTime":57488,"nextInTime":57490,"topicId":57483,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Mine are 8 years apart - stepson and daughter. Its kind of a thrill when they both get excited about the same thing at the same time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have suggested, other people are a valuable resource - but don&#39;t forget that sometimes it can be better to ask other people to help out with the girls, too. That&#39;s something to be aware of as a step-mom, especially, because you want your guy to feel as solidly a part of the family as anyone else. Its challenging enough to have two new babies in the house without the doubts that can creep in to a step-child&#39;s mind.

I&#39;ve had<br/>\n&gt; warnings from concerned friends and family that I wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>\n&gt; *teach* Julian with the two babies around.  Because we are on more of an<br/>\n&gt; unschooling path, and because J has lots of interests, I wasn&#39;t too<br/>\n&gt; concerned.  I know that, for instance, my MIL is worried that I can&#39;t stand<br/>\n&gt; at the front of the *school room* and give J lectures on all his *required<br/>\n&gt; subjects* with two babies, and she&#39;s right, I can&#39;t.

That&#39;s too much waiting. I mean, just take the example of games <br/>\n&gt; there are LOTS of times that kids can&#39;t imagine how much fun a game is going<br/>\n&gt; to be, just from looking at the box, for example. If YOU know that she LOVED<br/>\n&gt; Candyland, then you might pick up Chutes and Ladders because it is also<br/>\n&gt; likely to be fun for her  ou don&#39;t need to wait for her to ask for it. She<br/>\n&gt; might never happen to see it and might very likely never realize that it is<br/>\n&gt; a game she&#39;d like a lot. Or maybe she loves CLUE  she&#39;d likely enjoy<br/>\n&gt; MASTERMIND  both involve the same kind of logical thinking. So  how is she<br/>\n&gt; going to know that?**  I&#39;ve heard of unschoolers who say they never bring<br/>\n&gt; home anything for their kids, because they feel that puts subtle pressure on<br/>\n&gt; them to learn what the parents are promoting. I say hogwash to that. I pick<br/>\n&gt; up stuff ALL the time  STILL do it and mine are 14, 18, and almost 21. If I<br/>\n&gt; see an unusual fruit in the grocery store, I buy it and take it home and put<br/>\n&gt; it on the table for others to notice. If a kid is in the store with me I<br/>\n&gt; might say, &quot;Oooh look at this. Let&#39;s take it home and cut it open. (Pam<br/>\n&gt; Sorooshian)&quot; *<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; And I realized that often, J is kind of left on his own, and he has been<br/>\n&gt; doing this lately: laying on the couch, looking unhappy, sighing loudly,<br/>\n&gt; saying, &quot;I&#39;m booooored.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; He has lots of stuff to play with, and every now and then he gets absorbed<br/>\n&gt; in video games or Legos.  But I know he would benefit if I could offer more<br/>\n&gt; of my own time to explore different things with him.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  I know there are SO many things he and I would be doing together if I<br/>\n&gt; wasn&#39;t rushing back and forth between the needs of these two baby girls.  J<br/>\n&gt; wants to do things with me.  We have so often talked about doing this or<br/>\n&gt; that -- his dad even mowed a path in the back part of our 40-acre property,<br/>\n&gt; and we were going to go out there and do a bunch of exploring around the<br/>\n&gt; trees and shrubs and creek, but...the babies make it, if not impossible,<br/>\n&gt; definitely difficult.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I don&#39;t get out of the house much.  Even going down to our library, less<br/>\n&gt; than half a mile down our road, is kind of tricky.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe I&#39;m making excuses -- it&#39;s NOT impossible, like I said.  It&#39;s just<br/>\n&gt; that both babies are really demanding.  The 18 month old wants what she<br/>\n&gt; wants, when she wants it.  And I follow her lead a lot.  She has the biggest<br/>\n&gt; needs right now, I would say.  Julian is more capable of waiting and<br/>\n&gt; entertaining himself.  The 4-month-old is starting to have bigger needs, but<br/>\n&gt; for now, she&#39;s pretty content to hang out in the bouncy seat.  And I do have<br/>\n&gt; a carrier for her -- but when I have her strapped to my chest, it makes it<br/>\n&gt; difficult to meet the needs of Josephine, the 18-month-old.  (hard to bend<br/>\n&gt; over, lift Josephine up, etc.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; As one example, Julian really likes and wants to cook.  He wants me to help<br/>\n&gt; him, and be in the kitchen with him.  However, our kitchen is just not quite<br/>\n&gt; baby-proofed for Josephine, and even if she could be in there with us while<br/>\n&gt; we worked, she would be yanking on my leg for my full attention the whole<br/>\n&gt; time.  Usually when I&#39;m making supper, Julian is in the living room with<br/>\n&gt; her, keeping her company, playing with her.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I have only one friend nearby (15 minutes away) who is also home-schooling<br/>\n&gt; and who has kids around Julian&#39;s age.  She and her boys are really busy with<br/>\n&gt; activities and such, and it&#39;s been difficult to coordinate schedules.  She<br/>\n&gt; also has one older boy in public high school, and she&#39;s involved in a lot of<br/>\n&gt; carpooling for his sports.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Julian is frustrated with the high needs of the babies.  I am trying to be<br/>\n&gt; empathetic about it with him, and just try and love on him and give him my<br/>\n&gt; time when they&#39;re sleeping or otherwise engaged.  But -- you know -- that&#39;s<br/>\n&gt; pretty rare.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I struggle with my own expectations, too, because I feel like he has a lot<br/>\n&gt; of independence, which I didn&#39;t get as a child.  I, too, was a lonely child<br/>\n&gt; with few friends my age, but I was trapped by my mom&#39;s fear of everything.<br/>\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t go or do anything.  I feel almost jealous of his freedom.  I do<br/>\n&gt; the whole, &quot;Jeez, if I were him I&#39;d be gone -- running the back woods for<br/>\n&gt; hours, riding my bike to the library,&quot; etc. -- which I know is not the way<br/>\n&gt; to look at it, and I NEVER say something like that to him.  He&#39;s not into<br/>\n&gt; that.  He wants a friend with him or he wants me to hang out with him, and<br/>\n&gt; I&#39;ve had to re-examine my own thought process and not judge him about it.<br/>\n&gt; Ideally, he wants me to adopt a 10-year-old boy (he has asked me to,<br/>\n&gt; actually), so he could have someone to play army with, and run around with.<br/>\n&gt; Seriously, if I could, I would consider it.

I&#39;ve had<br/>\nwarnings from concerned friends and family that I wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>\n*teach* Julian with the two babies around.  Because we are on more of an<br/>\nunschooling path, and because J has lots of interests, I wasn&#39;t too<br/>\nconcerned.  I know that, for instance, my MIL is worried that I can&#39;t stand<br/>\nat the front of the *school room* and give J lectures on all his *required<br/>\nsubjects* with two babies, and she&#39;s right, I can&#39;t.  Which is fine with me,<br/>\nbecause we don&#39;t do school at home anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was just re-reading this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/nest\">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>\n<br/>\n*Excerpt: &quot;...Are you saying you&#39;re never using your own knowledge about<br/>\nwhat might interest her, but waiting for her to take the initiative all the<br/>\ntime? That&#39;s too much waiting. I mean, just take the example of games �<br/>\nthere are LOTS of times that kids can&#39;t imagine how much fun a game is going<br/>\nto be, just from looking at the box, for example. If YOU know that she LOVED<br/>\nCandyland, then you might pick up Chutes and Ladders because it is also<br/>\nlikely to be fun for her � ou don&#39;t need to wait for her to ask for it. She<br/>\nmight never happen to see it and might very likely never realize that it is<br/>\na game she&#39;d like a lot. Or maybe she loves CLUE � she&#39;d likely enjoy<br/>\nMASTERMIND � both involve the same kind of logical thinking. So � how is she<br/>\ngoing to know that?**  I&#39;ve heard of unschoolers who say they never bring<br/>\nhome anything for their kids, because they feel that puts subtle pressure on<br/>\nthem to learn what the parents are promoting. I say hogwash to that. I pick<br/>\nup stuff ALL the time � STILL do it and mine are 14, 18, and almost 21. If I<br/>\nsee an unusual fruit in the grocery store, I buy it and take it home and put<br/>\nit on the table for others to notice. If a kid is in the store with me I<br/>\nmight say, &quot;Oooh look at this. Let&#39;s take it home and cut it open. (Pam<br/>\nSorooshian)&quot; *<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I realized that often, J is kind of left on his own, and he has been<br/>\ndoing this lately: laying on the couch, looking unhappy, sighing loudly,<br/>\nsaying, &quot;I&#39;m booooored.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has lots of stuff to play with, and every now and then he gets absorbed<br/>\nin video games or Legos.  But I know he would benefit if I could offer more<br/>\nof my own time to explore different things with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know there are SO many things he and I would be doing together if I<br/>\nwasn&#39;t rushing back and forth between the needs of these two baby girls.  J<br/>\nwants to do things with me.  We have so often talked about doing this or<br/>\nthat -- his dad even mowed a path in the back part of our 40-acre property,<br/>\nand we were going to go out there and do a bunch of exploring around the<br/>\ntrees and shrubs and creek, but...the babies make it, if not impossible,<br/>\ndefinitely difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t get out of the house much.  Even going down to our library, less<br/>\nthan half a mile down our road, is kind of tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I&#39;m making excuses -- it&#39;s NOT impossible, like I said.  It&#39;s just<br/>\nthat both babies are really demanding.  The 18 month old wants what she<br/>\nwants, when she wants it.  And I follow her lead a lot.  She has the biggest<br/>\nneeds right now, I would say.  Julian is more capable of waiting and<br/>\nentertaining himself.  The 4-month-old is starting to have bigger needs, but<br/>\nfor now, she&#39;s pretty content to hang out in the bouncy seat.  And I do have<br/>\na carrier for her -- but when I have her strapped to my chest, it makes it<br/>\ndifficult to meet the needs of Josephine, the 18-month-old.  (hard to bend<br/>\nover, lift Josephine up, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs one example, Julian really likes and wants to cook.  He wants me to help<br/>\nhim, and be in the kitchen with him.  However, our kitchen is just not quite<br/>\nbaby-proofed for Josephine, and even if she could be in there with us while<br/>\nwe worked, she would be yanking on my leg for my full attention the whole<br/>\ntime.  Usually when I&#39;m making supper, Julian is in the living room with<br/>\nher, keeping her company, playing with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only one friend nearby (15 minutes away) who is also home-schooling<br/>\nand who has kids around Julian&#39;s age.  She and her boys are really busy with<br/>\nactivities and such, and it&#39;s been difficult to coordinate schedules.  She<br/>\nalso has one older boy in public high school, and she&#39;s involved in a lot of<br/>\ncarpooling for his sports.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulian is frustrated with the high needs of the babies.  I am trying to be<br/>\nempathetic about it with him, and just try and love on him and give him my<br/>\ntime when they&#39;re sleeping or otherwise engaged.  But -- you know -- that&#39;s<br/>\npretty rare.<br/>\n<br/>\nI struggle with my own expectations, too, because I feel like he has a lot<br/>\nof independence, which I didn&#39;t get as a child.  I, too, was a lonely child<br/>\nwith few friends my age, but I was trapped by my mom&#39;s fear of everything.<br/>\nI couldn&#39;t go or do anything.  I feel almost jealous of his freedom.  I do<br/>\nthe whole, &quot;Jeez, if I were him I&#39;d be gone -- running the back woods for<br/>\nhours, riding my bike to the library,&quot; etc. -- which I know is not the way<br/>\nto look at it, and I NEVER say something like that to him.  He&#39;s not into<br/>\nthat.  He wants a friend with him or he wants me to hang out with him, and<br/>\nI&#39;ve had to re-examine my own thought process and not judge him about it.<br/>\nIdeally, he wants me to adopt a 10-year-old boy (he has asked me to,<br/>\nactually), so he could have someone to play army with, and run around with.<br/>\nSeriously, if I could, I would consider it.  I hate seeing him so unhappy<br/>\nand lonely.  His dad is here all the time, working outside, and Julian knows<br/>\nhe is always welcome to be out there with his dad helping.  Sometimes he<br/>\ndoes that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have only one vehicle, and most of the time, I cannot ask my husband to<br/>\nwatch the babies while I do something with Julian, because it cuts into his<br/>\nwork.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I need to work harder at moving the babies with us, so Julian and I can<br/>\ndo some engaging things outside the house?  (I know I tend to start<br/>\nthinking, &quot;oh, that would mean making bottles, and packing the diaper bag,<br/>\nand dragging the stroller out, and putting seats in the van, and ...&quot; In<br/>\nother words, making excuses for how hard it would be to do X or Y with the<br/>\nbabies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll stop there.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nDeb<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":57610,"nextTopicId":57628}}
