Should I even try to stop the grade labeling, or just let him go with whatever makes him comfortable?  I have the feeling it&#39;s more my discomfort with looking or sounding schoolish more than anything else.  I&#39;d love to hear anyone else&#39;s input/experience.<br/>\nKim<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":10590565,"authorName":"conniecolten@aol.com","from":"conniecolten@...","profile":"conniecolten","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re:grades","postDate":"1079622331","msgId":19081,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE2NC4yY2ZmYmViYi4yZDhiMTRiYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19101,"prevInTime":19080,"nextInTime":19082,"topicId":19081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... ***Yesterday I finally had the wonderful massage my good friend gave me at my blessingway before I went on my hike to the Appalachian Trail.

The masseuse <br/>\nwas telling me that she had homeschooled her son last year.  Before that he <br/>\nwas in school and was getting F&#39;s.  She said when she talked with people at his <br/>\nschool they were so concerned with the grades, and didn&#39;t listen to her when <br/>\nshe stated that her goal was to have her child grow up to be a decent human <br/>\nbeing.  Anyway, after one year at home (using materials thro the school system), <br/>\nthe child elected to go back to school for his high school years and is now <br/>\nmaking A&#39;s.  Like the mom said, she doesn&#39;t care about the grades, but it makes <br/>\nschool easier for her son to get better ones.  She was sad that he didn&#39;t want <br/>\nto stay at home.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2300774,"authorName":"Elizabeth Hill","from":"Elizabeth Hill &lt;ecsamhill@...&gt;","profile":"ecsamhill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re:grades","postDate":"1079620418","msgId":19101,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQwNTlCMzQyLjkwNzA1MDdAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDE2NC4yY2ZmYmViYi4yZDhiMTRiYkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":19081,"nextInTopic":36792,"prevInTime":19100,"nextInTime":19102,"topicId":19081,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** I see the Sylvan learning ads and they make me very sad. ... ** I finally paid attention to this ad this morning.
