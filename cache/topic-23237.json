Please forgive crossposts for anyone who may be on more than <br/>\none list with me.  I&#39;m trying to hit as broad a canvas as possible <br/>\nwith this information.  Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\nHi.  My name is Nanci, ans I am a mom with a son who has Aspergers <br/>\nand other special needs.  I have created a brand new mailing list to <br/>\ntry to connect families in my area.  Please read the information <br/>\nbelow if you are located in Jefferson, Clallam or Kitsap Counties in <br/>\nWA State.  Please pass this information along to any other lists or <br/>\nindividuals whom you think might be interested in it.  Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nOlympic Peninsula Special At Home is a mailing list for support and <br/>\nnetworking between families in Jefferson, Clallam and parts of <br/>\nKitsap County, Wasington State, who are Homeschooling Special Needs <br/>\nor Medically Fragile Kids, or thinking about homeschooling them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe purpose of the list is to connect, offer support, share ideas, <br/>\npass along local news and information about events and services, <br/>\nspark friendships, plan get togethers, etc.  My hope for the list is <br/>\nto create a safe and friendly virtual community center full of <br/>\nunderstanding and experienced families in our greater community, and <br/>\nto build a badly needed social support network for our families.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll homeschooling styles, family types, faiths, and special needs <br/>\nare welcome. This is an eclectic and inclusive group with no <br/>\nreligious or other affiliations.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s reach out to each other and hold hands, creating a web of <br/>\nsupport across the North East Olympic and North Kitsap Peninsulas!</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23234,"nextTopicId":23241}}
