My kids seem so focused on<br/>\n&gt; playing the computer.  They are addicted to &quot;The Sims&quot;.  It is a very<br/>\n&gt; mentally stimulating game but prevents exposure to other things.  It<br/>\n&gt; seems like as soon as I am done introducing them to something, they<br/>\n&gt; go back to playing on the computer.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Two of my kids (14 and 11) got a new SIMS expansion pack last night (they <br/>\nsplit the cost) - I left them home all day today while I went off to the <br/>\nceramics studio. I called them every couple of hours - they played, happily <br/>\nand TOGETHER, all day. They&#39;ll be obsessed with it for a while - that&#39;s okay, <br/>\nit is very very cool and I don&#39;t blame them. But it won&#39;t last forever. After <br/>\na few weeks they&#39;ll still be into it - but not to play it for hours a day. <br/>\nAnd, we go out of the house enough that they do take time off &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new one is SIMS Vacation and on sale at Best Buy for $29 plus there is a <br/>\n$10 Best Buy Gift Card you get by mail.
