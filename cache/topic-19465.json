We thought that was a great <br/>\nidea.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some reusable cloth gift bags from an early business venture, so if <br/>\nyou order a book for Mother&#39;s Day, write Mother&#39;s Day in the business line of <br/>\nthe order form, and I&#39;ll put in a gift bag with the book for wrapping (or send <br/>\nit wrapped to the mom- send an e-mail to let me know).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you no longer have your mom available to &quot;gift&quot; perhaps you&#39;d like to <br/>\ndonate a copy of HOMESCHOOLING REFLECTIONS  to your local library as a gift to <br/>\nother moms. You can send me an e-mail to that effect, after placing your order, <br/>\nand I can send it to the library you specify, with a donation notation in the <br/>\nbook if you&#39;d like.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, if you&#39;d like to receive the book as a gift, send this e-mail on to the <br/>\nperson/people that &quot;gift&quot; you on that day!<br/>\n<br/>\nYours,<br/>\nConnie<br/>\nwww.homeschoolingreflections.com<br/>\n<br/>\nps - feel free to pass this e-mail onto other lists if you feel the urge! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19432,"nextTopicId":19329}}
