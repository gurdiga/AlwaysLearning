I was  <br/>\ntalking about other trips she&#39;s taken, her stay in England when she  <br/>\nwas 13, and my upcoming visit to the same family (though they&#39;re in  <br/>\nFrance now).   She said she&#39;s heard that the &quot;bad words&quot; in Quebec are  <br/>\nmore religious than those in France.  I said probably Louisiana, too,  <br/>\nbecause France seems to have thrown religion out during the  <br/>\nRevolution.  I&#39;m doing a workshop in August on &quot;bad words.&quot;    So I  <br/>\ntold her about a line being taken out of one of of my pieces of  <br/>\nwriting, when it was translated to French--a line about Jesus.  She  <br/>\nasked me to find it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a five minute discussion in my kitchen led to me sending this to  <br/>\nthe list, but the reason I&#39;m sending it is the recent spate of people  <br/>\ncoming to the list sure that all ideas are equal.  Unschooling.  This  <br/>\nlist is for discussing unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce upon a time a confident and experienced scholar went to the best  <br/>\nZen teacher he knew, to apply to be his student. The master offered  <br/>\ntea, and he held out his cup. While the student recited his knowledge  <br/>\nand cataloged his accomplishments to date, the master poured slowly.  <br/>\nThe bragging continued, and the pouring continued, until the student  <br/>\nwas getting a lapful of tea, and said, “My cup is full!” The master  <br/>\nsmiled and said, “Yes, it is. And until you empty yourself of what you  <br/>\nthink you know, you won’t be able to learn.”<br/>\n<br/>\nWeird Al says it a different way in “Everything You Know is Wrong,”  <br/>\nand Christians say “You must surrender yourself.” Before that Jesus  <br/>\nsaid, “Unless you become as a little child…”<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it means in homeschooling terms is that as long as you think you  <br/>\ncan control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to come  <br/>\nto unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open yourself  <br/>\nto new ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural learning  <br/>\nblossom.<br/>\n<br/>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/deschooling\">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is another misconception going around that if one&#39;s children  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t go to school there&#39;s no need for deschooling.  The parents  <br/>\nstill went to school, and will not recover just from wishing for it,  <br/>\nor imagining that joining an unschooling list makes one an unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s work to do, and changes to be made, and HUNDREDS of people  <br/>\nhere willing to help you do that!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":55917,"nextTopicId":56172}}
