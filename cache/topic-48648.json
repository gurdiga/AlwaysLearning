Preferable one that perplexes them enough that they do not pursue the line of questioning. e.g., &quot;Do you think she watches too many videos?&quot;, retort: &quot;The latest research is that no one can watch enough videos.&quot; This should perplex them since the question about watching too many videos is most likely based on some sort of research that shows people can watch too many videos. And chances are, they can not cite that research at all, but believe it since someone of authority told it to them once. Well when you say &quot;the latest research&quot; it automatically negates their old research that they can&#39;t even cite, so most likely they will drop it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing to remember is that they really believe they are looking out for your best interests and you can be very creative in reassuring them you also have your best interests taken care of without offending them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrad Jones<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: DaBreeze21 &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:susanmay15@...\">susanmay15@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Tue, November 17, 2009 8:30:41 AM<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Tips on getting &quot;Thicker Skin&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nHi, <br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions or tips on how they have gotten better at letting things go -- specifically comments from others, mostly family, about parenting or lifestyle choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know in my head that I need to be &quot;tougher&quot; and strong in my decisions and not worry about what others think, but it seems easier said than done.

Without thinking very hard,  <br/>\nI&#39;m figuring there&#39;s music, art, geography, cultural differences,  <br/>\naccents or languages, vocabulary, concepts such as old/young, near/ <br/>\nfar, big/small, funny/sad--not that she can&#39;t get those at home, but  <br/>\nin stories she can think of those things without it being personally  <br/>\nabout her.  She can consider a fictional character&#39;s frustration or  <br/>\nsorrow without experiencing her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you have ready and enthusiastic answers to those questions, they  <br/>\nwon&#39;t seem so onerous, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when you make statements or give answer, consider qualifying your  <br/>\nstatements.

If it stops working, we&#39;ll put him in  <br/>\nschool.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people might see that as wimpy, or as a dodge, but I see  <br/>\nignorance and pomposity in an over-arching comment such as &quot;He will  <br/>\nNEVER go to school.&quot;  If a statement seems (and is) short-sighted,  <br/>\nthen the in-laws will believe (rightly) that the mother is being short- <br/>\nsighted.  If a statement contains its own intention for constant  <br/>\nchecks and balances, then the mother will be seen (and will also feel,  <br/>\nin herself) that she&#39;s living mindfully and attending to the success  <br/>\nor failure of her plans and actions all the way along.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":128237955,"authorName":"Beth","from":"&quot;Beth&quot; &lt;saremca@...&gt;","profile":"saremca","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Tips on getting &quot;Thicker Skin&quot;","postDate":"1258470280","msgId":48652,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEUyQ0YzN0Y4QzBGOTQ3MDZCNjg0Q0VDMUFENDI0NDQ2QEZBTUlMWVJPT00+","inReplyToHeader":"PGhkdWMyaCtraXJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PGhkdWMyaCtraXJAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":48651,"nextInTopic":48654,"prevInTime":48651,"nextInTime":48653,"topicId":48648,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"= =I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions or tips on how they have gotten better at letting things go -- specifically comments from others, mostly","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1038457242\">=&#92;=I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions or tips on how they<br/>\nhave gotten better at letting things go -- specifically comments from<br/>\nothers, mostly family, about parenting or lifestyle choices.=&#92;=<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took practice.
