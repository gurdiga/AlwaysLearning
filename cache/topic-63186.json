Everyone will be &quot;wounded&quot; at some point.  It is up to each individual as to how they will allow that to effect them for the rest of their life.===  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I think of that, it doesn&#39;t have to do with being &quot;morally grounded&quot; and &quot;forgiving.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband grew up going to Catholic school, as the public schools in the inner city where he lived were (in his parents&#39; opinion) too dangerous.  The &quot;instruction&quot; he was given in reading was, from his accounts, quite detrimental instead of helpful.  The kids in his school were drilled, tested, and forced to follow a phonics program.  Phonics never made much sense to him (allowed to learn to read on his own, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;d read like my 8 year old does - from patterns and memorization and not using phonics) and he struggled with reading from the start.  He ended up receiving extra 1:1 &quot;remedial reading support instruction&quot; (his school&#39;s version of a label was to put you in the &quot;remedial&quot; category).  To this day he&#39;ll tell me &quot;I really hate reading&quot; and he says it often takes him 2 or 3 times reading through something before he really gets the meaning, which he also credits back to his schools&#39; emphasis on phonics instead of comprehension and understanding.  <br/>\n<br/>\nContrast this to my son&#39;s experiences with reading - where he is growing up surrounded by print, words, books, computers, games, etc.  He discovered words and reading on his own, based on his own desires and interests.  He&#39;s 8 now and reads fluently - however he also doesn&#39;t hesitate to ask for help when he finds a word he doesn&#39;t know.  And when he asks for help, my husband and I don&#39;t tell him &quot;sound it out&quot; - we tell him what the word is and he usually responds &quot;oh - cool!&quot; and then bounces on to finish whatever he&#39;s reading through.  There has been no shame, no drills, no tests, and no instruction involved in his relationship with words Â– and so his relationship is a good one!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am fairly certain that no amount of forgiveness or ambition could overcome my husband&#39;s experience with &quot;reading instruction&quot; and what that experience has done with his interest in and his ability to interact with printed words.  His ambition led him to a college degree in engineering and a career that he enjoys - but it did not lead him to a point where all those phonics drills, remedial classes, etc. no longer affect him.  If he forgave the teachers and the system for being what they were, would he become a better, happier reader?  Nope.  But our son benefits from his dad&#39;s school experiences, since &quot;I don&#39;t want my son to learn to read the way I did!&quot; gives yet more support to our decision to unschool  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nColleen</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Woundedness (was Re: &quot;Research&quot; on Reading?","postDate":"1317221656","msgId":63198,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQzNjI4MTU4LUZEMkItNEVDOS1CRTAzLTM5MUNCOEZDQjNCMkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1dmFrdCs4NWpvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1dmFrdCs4NWpvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63197,"nextInTopic":63199,"prevInTime":63197,"nextInTime":63199,"topicId":63186,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I wrote: Except for those who have taught 12 year olds in public school and so know firsthand that there are kids with six years of reading instruction who 1)","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1949358519\">I wrote: <br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Except for those who have taught 12 year olds in public school and so know<br/>\nfirsthand that there are kids with six years of reading instruction who 1)<br/>\ncannot read and 2) are ashamed and sneaky and horribly wounded because of it,<br/>\nlearning to try to fake it or trying to survive with hostility and defensive<br/>\nactions, so schools label them in horrible, unfair ways, blaming the kids,<br/>\nblaming &quot;conditions,&quot; blaming parents, and many of those kids will NEVER, ever<br/>\nrecover in their entire lives.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote that because I taught seventh graders for four years.

Some are ten, and twelve.  Not maybe.   There are. Some of them (almost all boys) have failed a grade, been held back, probably in first grade.  They will &quot;be behind&quot; for the rest of their school career. They will be in school for another year when other kids their age are out going to college or getting jobs.  It will be because they weren&#39;t reading well enough to be promoted.  And what schools consider &quot;reading&quot; in the early years involves &quot;controlled readers&quot; of some sort, with words chosen to be short and phonetic.  It&#39;s not normal real-world reading.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis part was quoted:<br/>\n**are ashamed and sneaky and horribly wounded because of it, learning to try to fake it or trying to survive with hostility and defensive actions, so schools label them in horrible, unfair ways, blaming the kids, blaming &quot;conditions,&quot; blaming parents, and many of those kids will NEVER, ever recover in their entire lives.**<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was asserted:<br/>\n-=-That presupposes the inability of the child to grow and mature into a well developed, morally grounded, forgiving individual with ambitions and desires to do better than a label that was put on them in school or anywhere else for that matter.

What if the results along the way of the second approach  <br/>\nlook nothing like the first approach, but both are judge by the  <br/>\nexpected progress of the first approach?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s very very hard to test the progress of a process where skills are  <br/>\npicked up in a seemingly random order. If the yard stick used is  <br/>\nprogress on a linear scale (and most educators believe reading skills  <br/>\ndo need to be acquired in a specific order) the second group will  <br/>\nrepeatedly fail. They&#39;ll fail until the child is reading fluently. And  <br/>\nwhat mother would keep her child in a study that all along was  <br/>\n(seemingly) showing it wasn&#39;t working very well?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only data we have -- can humanely have really -- is the data self- <br/>\nreported by unschoolers, people who already trust the approach will  <br/>\nwork. And by &quot;work&quot; I mean, kids can read what they need for their own  <br/>\npurposes by the time they&#39;re ready to go off on their own. (Unschooled  <br/>\nkids read much earlier! But being on their own is when reading  <br/>\nindependently comes in the most handy. :-) The typical ages for  <br/>\nunschooling kids reading are 6-10 (a bit later for boys). But the  <br/>\nrange can be 3 or 4 to over 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe &quot;over 12&quot; would make any mother freak if she didn&#39;t believe in the  <br/>\napproach! But what unschoolers know from experience -- as scientists  <br/>\nin our own test of the theory (the schools providing the other group  <br/>\nof kids) -- is that a child who doesn&#39;t read until 12 is learning just  <br/>\nfine without reading. They&#39;re using all sorts of different ways of  <br/>\nlearning about the world that are more natural to them. *And* once  <br/>\nthey begin reading, they aren&#39;t 6 years behind a child who began at 6.  <br/>\nThey very quickly are reading at the level of their peers. Very  <br/>\nshortly you can&#39;t tell the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the closest you might come to scientific data is looking at  <br/>\nhow the Finns approach reading instruction. They have the highest  <br/>\nliteracy rate in the world. They don&#39;t even begin instruction until  <br/>\nkids are 7.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oph.fi/english/sources_of_information/international_assessments/pisa/literacy_in_finland\">http://www.oph.fi/english/sources_of_information/international_assessments/pisa/literacy_in_finland</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s probably about as close as mass reading instruction can get to  <br/>\nthe personalized attention that unschooled kids get.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s cool that they mention &quot;net surfing, text messages and role  <br/>\ngames&quot; as being supportive of reading. (Though then subvert it by  <br/>\nimplying that reading should be about books.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I want to point out is &quot;the ample supply of foreign films on  <br/>\ntelevision provided with Finnish sub-titles&quot; makes it sound like a big  <br/>\nfactor and without it kids wouldn&#39;t learn to read. The big factor is  <br/>\ntext the *child* finds useful for their own interests. Loads of  <br/>\nunschoolers credit video games (the text in them, and to a lesser  <br/>\nextent, the gaming guides and on line cheats) as being the largest  <br/>\nfactor in their own kids&#39; figuring out reading. Video games aren&#39;t  <br/>\nnecessary! but they do provide the factors most useful in learning  <br/>\nanything: intense interest and tools to meet needs with.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids will read whenever they are developmentally ready to read. Until  <br/>\nthey&#39;re developmentally ready, if they&#39;re experiences with print are  <br/>\npositive, they won&#39;t be pulling back from something they have negative  <br/>\nassociations with. They&#39;ll be going to it as they need it. Each time  <br/>\nit serves their own need, they&#39;ll have used it more and get better at  <br/>\nit *as a side effect*. And as they get better, they&#39;ll go to it more.  <br/>\nAnd so it progresses. Just as they did with speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nKids who are more drawn to physical activities and less to those that  <br/>\nneed sitting will generally take longer to figure out reading. But by  <br/>\nthe time kids have hit puberty (which is later for boys) all the brain  <br/>\nareas they will draw on for decoding the printed word are way more  <br/>\nmature than they were at 6 and they won&#39;t need as much exposure to  <br/>\nfigure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"1"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] &quot;Research&quot; on Reading?","postDate":"1317207769","msgId":63188,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMTcyMDc3NjkuMzE1MDYuWWFob29NYWlsUkNAd2ViODczMTUubWFpbC5pcmQueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo1dWYycitvNnJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo1dWYycitvNnJmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63186,"nextInTopic":63189,"prevInTime":63187,"nextInTime":63189,"topicId":63186,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Alan Thomas and Harriet Pattison have done research into how children learn within the framework of home-education.

It&#39;s hard to be comfortable with what could be labelled as neglect in <br/>\neducation by the powers that be, but I truly believe that if I had done anything <br/>\nto push Simon&#39;s reading development I would have only harmed him and hindered <br/>\nthe process and made him feel less than. I don&#39;t know how you comfort someone <br/>\nelse in the knowledge that they can&#39;t control how or when someone else learns <br/>\nsomething. Maybe you can look at what a struggle it is to force someone to learn <br/>\nto read and how many different programs there are, but my son, without any of <br/>\nthose things, came to reading in his own time and in his own way.
