And had they done it<br/>\nbecause<br/>\nthe actors complained? Their agents complained? I wondered whether the<br/>\npedal-powered washing machine (or whatever it was) really worked by the<br/>\npedals, or<br/>\nwhether it was just secretly plugged in, and if so, where did the wires run?<br/>\nI<br/>\nwondered if much of it was on indoor sets. How deep was that water? (As an<br/>\nadult, I saw what&#39;s left of the set at Universal Studios. Cool! Outside!<br/>\nActual<br/>\nlittle lake.) When I would see a show the second time, I&#39;d look around for<br/>\nthings I had missed the first time. I would re-write lines in my mind,<br/>\nthings that<br/>\ncould have been funnier, or sounded more in character for that person. I&#39;d<br/>\nwonder who knew more about hammock making, the captain or the professor?<br/>\nMaybe<br/>\nGinger or Mary Ann knew macramé. When there was a show which didn&#39;t have one<br/>\nof<br/>\nthe actors in, I&#39;d wonder whether he was sick or on vacation or what? And if<br/>\nan actor misses the filming of a sitcom, does he still get paid? I wondered<br/>\nabout them having to keep their hair the same for years, and which of them<br/>\nwere<br/>\nmight be wearing wigs. Where were they supposed to be getting nail polish<br/>\nand<br/>\nlipstick? Hair spray? I wondered if the professor was a physics professor or<br/>\nengineering, or what, and whether he would lose his job at the university. I<br/>\nwondered about that Mr. Magoo voice on Thurston Howell. I wondered about<br/>\nAmelia<br/>\nEarhart. I wondered about the soundtrack music. Did they just have little<br/>\nthemes they pushed a button on during final edit, or was each show done<br/>\nseparately? I wondered if the fruit was real or props. I wondered about<br/>\ncameras--where<br/>\nwere they? Did they have to sweep the dirt between takes? I wondered if the<br/>\nguy<br/>\nwho played the lost WWII pilot was really Japanese. I could think more<br/>\nduring<br/>\nan episode of Gilligan&#39;s Island than most other people I knew could think in<br/>\na whole week. I didn&#39;t bother to ask my parents any of the questions. They<br/>\nwould have thought it was stupid to be thinking them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to all outside appearances (except to my cousin, Nada, who was my age) I<br/>\nwas just zoning out, involved in the plot of another 25 minutes of<br/>\nGilligan&#39;s<br/>\nIsland.

How do  you deal with TV with your kids?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n*I* go through periods when I just sit a &quot;veg&quot; in front of the  <br/>\nTV---sometimes for days at a time. Sometimes I&#39;m sick or tired, sometimes I&#39;m  &quot;digesting&quot; <br/>\nsomething I spent a long time working on, sometimes there&#39;s  something I want <br/>\nto watch. I go through periods when the TV is never on,  yet I&#39;ll lie in bed a <br/>\nread for hours and hours at a time---book after book after  book. I go <br/>\nthrough periods when every waking moment I&#39;m in the garden or  painting or tiling or <br/>\ncooking or planning a conference or driving (like  that day we drove from MA <br/>\nto Columbia, SC.

Don&#39;t look at six straight hours of tv as harmful <br/>\n(that&#39;s  just watching _Titanic_ and _The Making of Titanic_!!!). Average it <br/>\nout over the  month. My guess is that it averages out to LESS than the amount <br/>\nthe average  schooled kid watches----the kid who&#39;s only allowed so many hours <br/>\nper day (he&#39;ll  be SURE to take every one!)!<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am lucky enough that I rarely watch TV unless I rent a  movie or some <br/>\n </span></blockquote>show comes on and I plan to watch it, I never watch TV just to  &quot;have <br/>\nsomething to do&quot; so I hope my child doesn&#39;t either.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nYou&#39;re not &quot;lucky&quot;. You&#39;re CHOOSING to do that. Your child may be  different. <br/>\nHe may do the same. <br/>\n <br/>\nWe have three TVs. None are on now. Duncan and a friend are out bouncing on  <br/>\nthe trampoline. I&#39;m on the computer (and getting ready to garden). Ben&#39;s at  <br/>\nwork. And Cameron is out to lunch with his girlfriend, plans to work for my  <br/>\nparents, and speak to a man about a job. <br/>\n <br/>\nI didn&#39;t tell Duncan and Tristram that it&#39;s a beautiful day (86 and sunny  <br/>\nwith a light breeze)----they can tell that themselves.

I wondered whether the <br/>\npedal-powered washing machine (or whatever it was) really worked by the pedals, or <br/>\nwhether it was just secretly plugged in, and if so, where did the wires run? I <br/>\nwondered if much of it was on indoor sets. How deep was that water? (As an <br/>\nadult, I saw what&#39;s left of the set at Universal Studios. Cool! Outside! Actual <br/>\nlittle lake.) When I would see a show the second time, I&#39;d look around for <br/>\nthings I had missed the first time. I would re-write lines in my mind, things that <br/>\ncould have been funnier, or sounded more in character for that person. I&#39;d <br/>\nwonder who knew more about hammock making, the captain or the professor? Maybe <br/>\nGinger or Mary Ann knew macramé. When there was a show which didn&#39;t have one of <br/>\nthe actors in, I&#39;d wonder whether he was sick or on vacation or what? And if <br/>\nan actor misses the filming of a sitcom, does he still get paid? I wondered <br/>\nabout them having to keep their hair the same for years, and which of them were <br/>\nmight be wearing wigs. Where were they supposed to be getting nail polish and <br/>\nlipstick? Hair spray? I wondered if the professor was a physics professor or <br/>\nengineering, or what, and whether he would lose his job at the university. I <br/>\nwondered about that Mr. Magoo voice on Thurston Howell. I wondered about Amelia <br/>\nEarhart. I wondered about the soundtrack music. Did they just have little <br/>\nthemes they pushed a button on during final edit, or was each show done <br/>\nseparately? I wondered if the fruit was real or props. I wondered about cameras--where <br/>\nwere they? Did they have to sweep the dirt between takes? I wondered if the guy <br/>\nwho played the lost WWII pilot was really Japanese. I could think more during <br/>\nan episode of Gilligan&#39;s Island than most other people I knew could think in <br/>\na whole week. I didn&#39;t bother to ask my parents any of the questions. They <br/>\nwould have thought it was stupid to be thinking them. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to all outside appearances (except to my cousin, Nada, who was my age) I <br/>\nwas just zoning out, involved in the plot of another 25 minutes of Gilligan&#39;s <br/>\nIsland.

I just figure they are<br/>\ngetting something out of it.  My kids really don&#39;t keep watching when it<br/>\nisn&#39;t something they like  &lt;at least not for long&gt; so I don&#39;t usually feel<br/>\nlike I need to draw them away from it.   If we get in a funk I might suggest<br/>\nboard (nothing like a good six hour game of Monopoly!) or card games because<br/>\nmy family really enjoys them.  Have you ever played Zilch, a dice game?<br/>\nIt&#39;s fun for all ages and easy. I am sure if you googled Zilch, you&#39;d find<br/>\nthe directions.  You need 5 dice.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the winter is when we are more often in a funk and we just need something<br/>\nto break up the monotony.  That&#39;s when I usually tell the girls I&#39;m going<br/>\noutside and see if they want to come with me.  It always makes me feel<br/>\nbetter to get out in the fresh air.  We have cross country skis, sleds, and<br/>\nsnow shoes, so if there is actually snow, it&#39;s a great diversion and makes<br/>\nus feel so good, even if it&#39;s only for 30 minutes ( sometimes it&#39;s mighty<br/>\ncold here in Maine.)  My girls ride horses at a barn up the road and a visit<br/>\nto the barn to bring up carrots or apples always cheers them up.  We&#39;ll<br/>\nshovel stalls sometimes and that cheers up the horses.  Maybe there is a<br/>\nfarm nearby that you could volunteer at?  Of course, there is always<br/>\nvisiting friends.  My kids really love it when I join them in a networked<br/>\ngame on the computers.  &lt;shoot em up&gt; Not really my cup of tea, but it sure<br/>\nmakes them happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, you really have to take your son&#39;s likes into account.  <br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nAngela ~ Maine<br/>\n<br/>\n*\tGame-enthusiast@.... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\nIncoming mail is certified Virus Free.<br/>\nChecked by AVG anti-virus system (http://www.grisoft.com).<br/>\nVersion: 6.0.766 / Virus Database: 513 - Release Date: 9/17/2004<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":99936689,"authorName":"mozafamily","from":"&quot;mozafamily&quot; &lt;mozafamily@...&gt;","profile":"mozafamily","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: interesting article on Play","postDate":"1095721924","msgId":20897,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGNpbm80NCsyZ3YxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDQwOTIwMjIzNjA2LlRKQUoyNTgzLm10YTkuYWRlbHBoaWEubmV0QGxlaWdoPg=="},"prevInTopic":20896,"nextInTopic":20898,"prevInTime":20896,"nextInTime":20898,"topicId":20883,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sometimes it takes an effort on the part of the parent to make life more interesting - yep I agree on what you said - most of the time when I m sick of him","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-391064396\">&quot;Sometimes it takes an effort on<br/>\nthe part of the parent to make life more interesting&quot; - yep I agree <br/>\non what you said - most of the time when I&#39;m sick of him watching TV <br/>\nis when I have been also been feeling sick for a few days(usually I <br/>\nget a kidney infection or a sinus allergy heachaches) or I am jammed <br/>\nup working too much at my work at home job as well, or relaxing for <br/>\na week because the weeks prior have been so bus.

Some people are <br/>\ntotally opposed to TV or some set limits on it. So far we haven&#39;t <br/>\nset limits on TV just like we don&#39;t set limits on computer stuff, <br/>\nplay time, etc. I leave it up to my child to decide as much as <br/>\npossible for himself. TV is a particularly hard parenting area IMHO, <br/>\nsome days my son is a royal couch potatoe - other days he does other <br/>\nthings, obviously he still learns a lot whether he watches TV or <br/>\nnot. Sometimes I get that periodic unschoolers panic disorder that <br/>\nmakes me think he&#39;s not doing okey if he watches so much TV, but <br/>\nusually within a week of me feeling that way then his interest in <br/>\ncertain shows may change and he usually looses interest in the TV <br/>\nfor awhile. Currently he&#39;s very &quot;into&quot; Code Lyoko which is rated for <br/>\n7up and even though my ds is only 6 he can tell you exactly what is <br/>\nhappening and even has his own ideas for story plots - but he does <br/>\nthat with a lot of things - started with his Thomas trains - he saw <br/>\nvideos and he also made up lots and lots of his own scenerios, not <br/>\njust repeating what he saw on the TV. So I feel like as long as he&#39;s <br/>\nusing the TV as inspiration and not just blindly following what is <br/>\nbeing said or done on the TV that he is doing okey with watching TV, <br/>\nthat he is understanding that TV isn&#39;t real life, etc. He goes <br/>\nthrough phases like I say sometimes I think he just must not feel <br/>\nwell because he will lay in bed all day and watch TV and then he may <br/>\nspend a whole week working with a computer program or a robot toy or <br/>\nbuilding with blocks, etc. So he&#39;s not drawn to he HAS to watch TV <br/>\neveryday, etc. if he wants to do something else he will and he <br/>\nusually has no objections to running errands with me or going to the <br/>\npark as well, although sometimes he will ask if we can wait 10 <br/>\nminutes until this program is over. SO mostly I am for TV and free <br/>\naccess to it but admitedly there are days I wish he would turn it <br/>\noff and do something else. How do you deal with TV with your kids? I <br/>\nam lucky enough that I rarely watch TV unless I rent a movie or some <br/>\nshow comes on and I plan to watch it, I never watch TV just to &quot;have <br/>\nsomething to do&quot; so I hope my child doesn&#39;t either.
