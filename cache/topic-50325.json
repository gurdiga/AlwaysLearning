They all seem so tired and their mum&#39;s have tales of having to  <br/>\npeel them out of bed in the morning. -=-<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore any jump to what&#39;s in that article (an excerpt from  <br/>\nNurtureshock), I want to say that energy and enthusiasm also have to  <br/>\ndo with happy anticipation, and not just the number of hours slept.   <br/>\nIf there&#39;s something wonderful going to happen, people can wake up  <br/>\nenergetic and enthusiastic for it.

It&#39;s interesting. It&#39;s supportive of what unschoolers do.   <br/>\nIt is NOT supportive of anything it suggests will help, really.  The  <br/>\n&quot;fixes&quot; mentioned in the article reminded me of a story I can&#39;t find  <br/>\nnow.  I thought it was AEsop, but it might be someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\nA farmer had a garden, and the birds kept getting in.  He watched, to  <br/>\nsee how to keep them out.  He noticed that when they entered the  <br/>\ngarden, they barely skimmed the top of the garden wall.  So he added  <br/>\none more row of bricks to the wall to keep them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat will help is not starting school half an hour later, or an hour  <br/>\nlater, or trying to make teenagers go to bed an hour early.  Making  <br/>\nschool really useful and exciting might work, but that&#39;s not going to  <br/>\nhappen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat helps with all the things mentioned in the article is letting  <br/>\nchildren and teens sleep until they wake up naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":50304,"nextTopicId":50370}}
