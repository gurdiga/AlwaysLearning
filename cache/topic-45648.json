My husband found a link to unschooling through a Permetheus site and forwarded it to me.  I cam here in search of better understanding this method of teaching.  I&#39;m new to homeschooling as well.  I have been trying to form a structured way to teach my 5 year old.  All our other children have been in public school and our expereinces there have pushed us toward homeschooling our youngest.  We have found our views and ways of thinking and living do not agree with the public schools or most people here in NC.  I have homeschooled our son since he was 4.  I have done this on the basis of my education in child day care management.  I have tried to structure it so it was fun and not over-whelming for my son.  It works sometimes and other times it doesn&#39;t.  There are areas he really excels at and then others that he is very good in but refuses to want to learn that part of a lesson.  <br/>\n  After some reading of several sites on unschooling and watching several videos, I came here for further information.  My issues with my sons learning habits are, that they are like my own.  He works better in short intervals of time and with my physical learning activities.  he hates writting but loves to tell stories (we have huge issues with writting letters and numbers).  Well here ar emy questions.  I thank you all for your advice and answers and hope to learn much from this group.<br/>\n <br/>\n1. How does this work with State rules on registering as a home schooling family when the child reaches 7?  Do you still have to do this as a unschooler?  Are there any other rule or gauidlines that connect with state levels I should be aware of and were do I find them?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. If lesson plans are not used, what is the method of teaching used or is it all a personal choice?<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Is there a set cirrculium or some type of guidelines for one? <br/>\n<br/>\n4.  How does learning as a unschooler tranfer to state required testing and graduation and colleges?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all <br/>\nCris</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":45599,"nextTopicId":45665}}
