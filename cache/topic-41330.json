Particularly older <br/>\npeople or perhaps with disability. So, you could contact local vets <br/>\nfor instance, explain what you are offering and they might put you in <br/>\ntouch with someone for example who might be arthritic and would love <br/>\nhelp brushing their dog, taking it for walks etcetera. Similarly - <br/>\nfind your version of what in Australia is &quot;guide dogs for the blind&quot; <br/>\nor other therapy dogs living with disabled people... I could see a <br/>\nwealth of opportunities for all of you, with this approach. It should <br/>\nalso avoid the &#39;insurance bogey&#39;. Just get to know a couple of dogs <br/>\nand their owners and visit regularly. Maybe put an add on a notice <br/>\nboard at a retirement village that allows pets?<br/>\n <br/>\nI know of a family who used to dog and house sit for a (very rich) <br/>\ncouple for periods of a month or more - living in luxury and caring <br/>\nfor a lovely dog.... <br/>\n<br/>\n Down the road a ways, Megan might start her own business, offering <br/>\nin home petcare and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime keep watching dog stuff - I highly recomend a British <br/>\ndog trainer - Victoria Stilwell - who had a show &quot;It&#39;s me or the <br/>\ndog&quot; - she really knows her stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nBake healthy dog treats, or make toys for dogs at the pound. Search <br/>\nthrift shops for tennis balls, blankets and towels that that dog <br/>\nshelters would need.
