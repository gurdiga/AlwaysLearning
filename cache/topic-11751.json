At least the<br/>\nkids weren&#39;t required to go to school (OVER MY DEAD<br/>\nBODY that would have been).  Life can be amazing<br/>\nsometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nConnie&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is amazing that the judge would rule like that. <br/>\nI was so lucky in my first divorce that my husband and<br/>\nI were able to be so fair with each other.  Nobody<br/>\ncould believe it.  We had married at 17 and had been<br/>\nmarried almost 17 years and it wasn&#39;t easy on either<br/>\nof us to divorce but we wanted to keep things as easy<br/>\nas we could.  We did a do-it-yourself divorce for $75<br/>\nand I let him have the house and basically everything<br/>\nin it, traded our weekends with the kids when we<br/>\nneeded to...  The judge sure seemed to have not seen<br/>\nsuch an easy divorce.  Of course, we weren&#39;t<br/>\nhomeschooling...<br/>\n<br/>\nI know things would be very different with my now<br/>\nhusband though and I bend over backwards to keep<br/>\nthings peaceful.  When we had a big fight last fall he<br/>\ntook off without even saying goodbye to the kids and<br/>\nwhen he got back to Seattle he emailed me telling me<br/>\nthat our marriage was over and that he was going to<br/>\ngive Boeing 2 weeks notice and then he was going to<br/>\n&quot;disappear&quot;.  He said he would rather do that than<br/>\n&quot;live in a cardboard box and pay all his money to me<br/>\nfor child support and alimony&quot;.  Give me a break!!  He<br/>\nknows very well how easy my other divorce was and how<br/>\nfair of a person I am.  His note sounded enough like<br/>\nhe might be thinking of suicide that I jumped in the<br/>\ncar and drove the 3 hrs to Seattle to rescue the<br/>\nsituation.  He definitely needs to grow up.  I would<br/>\nnever put money over the safety and happiness of my<br/>\nkids.  Is that just a mother thing??<br/>\nCheryl</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11752,"nextTopicId":11758}}
