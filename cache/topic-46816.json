Without the example and experience of people on this list, I would not have been able to grasp the broad systematic philosophy of unschooling that guides me in any given situation in my daily family life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the principles that have emerged from all my reading over the past two years are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n- my relationship with my child comes first (any act of mine should promote a loving and respectful relationship with my child)<br/>\n<br/>\n- arbitrary limits and controls do not promote such a relationship and should not be used<br/>\n<br/>\n- strewing things, activities and opportunities is vital to creating a rich and vibrant learning environment<br/>\n<br/>\n- I am my child&#39;s partner in negotiating the world; my child learns from my example<br/>\n<br/>\n- I am energised by making conscious choices; feeling that I &#39;have to&#39; do something drains my energy<br/>\n<br/>\n- each child is a precious, unique person; it is a parent&#39;s joy to be able to nuture and encourage their child&#39;s individual personality<br/>\n<br/>\nNo doubt others can expand or modify this list.  However, the point remains that by adopting a coherent set of principles (tried and tested by years of collective experience), an unschooler is guided in any situation that arises in our daily lives.
