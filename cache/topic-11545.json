I rehearsed my lines many times and I knew<br/>\nthat it could all blow up in my face. So I had to weigh was it worth losing<br/>\none of my closest friends to point out to him that he was destroying his<br/>\nrelationship with his kids?  Kids I didn&#39;t even know very well. It was a<br/>\ntough choice. If he took it wrong, we would no longer be friends and he<br/>\nwould still be on the path to destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou (Sandra) say that this guy trusts his kids with your family. That would<br/>\nmost assuredly change if Keith&#39;s talk goes badly. I wouldn&#39;t want to be the<br/>\none to ask Keith to have the talk. But, if he won&#39;t go to counseling the<br/>\nonly counseling he will get is from friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the kids see the mom sticking up for them? That seems to be the most<br/>\nimportant thing to establish before any moves are made.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe seems to be using a different script than hers.

If it is clear to<br/>\nhim that what ever ill-conceived power struggle he is having with the kids<br/>\nwill cost him the family he will either change because he values them (wife<br/>\nand kids) or he won&#39;t and she will know what little value she and the kids<br/>\nare to him and hopefully move on to doing whatever is necessary to protect<br/>\nthem.

Another mom of three.  Not on this list, not on any of the <br/>\nlists.  Not unschooling, though I met her at an unschooling conference years <br/>\nago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer husband is being a sadistic prick.  There&#39;s not nicer way to say it.   <br/>\nFor most of a year, when she&#39;s talked about divorce I&#39;ve talked her out of <br/>\nit.  I was afraid it would cause the kids to be unceremoniously slammed into <br/>\nschool, cause her to have to find a job and move into an apartment (she&#39;s <br/>\ntrained as a teacher, but once people have homeschooled it&#39;s hard for many of <br/>\nthem to even THINK about going back into the classroom) and suffer knowing <br/>\nthat when the kids are with their dad he can be as unreasonably strict and <br/>\nnon-communicative as he wants to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s especially harsh with the middle child, who is most like his mother.  <br/>\nObvious situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like every member of this family individually.   All grouped up, it&#39;s a <br/>\nmess.  The mom is really good with the kids, but the dad undermines and is <br/>\nbecoming more and more irrational.  Maybe it&#39;s mid-life crisis.  He&#39;s young, <br/>\nthough, 41.  Maybe it&#39;s some kind of mental illness but there is NO WAY he <br/>\nwill go for help on something like that.  He wouldn&#39;t even go to a marriage <br/>\ncounsellor unless it was a male Christian counsellor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m a confidant of the mom, a haven for the kids, but I have a streak (or <br/>\na lump) of stabbing sadness and fear that their seeing our happy unschooling <br/>\nis part of what&#39;s making them all so unhappy.

Not on this list, not on any of the <br/>\nlists.  Not unschooling, though I met her at an unschooling conference years <br/>\nago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer husband is being a sadistic prick.  There&#39;s not nicer way to say it.   <br/>\nFor most of a year, when she&#39;s talked about divorce I&#39;ve talked her out of <br/>\nit.  I was afraid it would cause the kids to be unceremoniously slammed into <br/>\nschool, cause her to have to find a job and move into an apartment (she&#39;s <br/>\ntrained as a teacher, but once people have homeschooled it&#39;s hard for many of <br/>\nthem to even THINK about going back into the classroom) and suffer knowing <br/>\nthat when the kids are with their dad he can be as unreasonably strict and <br/>\nnon-communicative as he wants to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s especially harsh with the middle child, who is most like his mother.  <br/>\nObvious situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like every member of this family individually.   All grouped up, it&#39;s a <br/>\nmess.  The mom is really good with the kids, but the dad undermines and is <br/>\nbecoming more and more irrational.  Maybe it&#39;s mid-life crisis.  He&#39;s young, <br/>\nthough, 41.  Maybe it&#39;s some kind of mental illness but there is NO WAY he <br/>\nwill go for help on something like that.  He wouldn&#39;t even go to a marriage <br/>\ncounsellor unless it was a male Christian counsellor.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I&#39;m a confidant of the mom, a haven for the kids, but I have a streak (or <br/>\na lump) of stabbing sadness and fear that their seeing our happy unschooling <br/>\nis part of what&#39;s making them all so unhappy.  Their knowing that at OUR <br/>\nhouse nobody is punished for not wanting to finish a piece of bread at dinner <br/>\nis making their life worse.  Their knowing that at our house nobody is woken <br/>\nup at 5:00 because a chore wasn&#39;t finished will contribute NOTHING to keeping <br/>\ntheir family together.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I feel like a contributing factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo sense feeling sorry for myself.  I&#39;m in a safe place with a sweet husband <br/>\nand busy kids.  But out of the corner of my eye that disaster is playing <br/>\nslowly out, and I&#39;ll have another phone conversation this afternoon, or one <br/>\nin person tomorrow, and I won&#39;t know what to say or do to keep from making <br/>\nthings worse by just being me.  I would like to be a strength to my friend, <br/>\nrather than the low spot in her wall where all the potential for trying again <br/>\nto homeschool and to parent to suit her husband just floods out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":11645,"nextTopicId":11647}}
