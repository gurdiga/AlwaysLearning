If you have a hard time remembering cute stories, it might help to write them down - keep a journal or a blog, or even write notes on something like facebook... but I&#39;d think a journal or blog would be better in some ways as it&#39;s more durable and you may want those cute stories again later, when the kids are grown ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;Right now they spend just about every waking minute on the computer playing Animal Jam or making videos with their LPS and Legos, and listening to music.

Don&#39;t make it a report, make it a story people want to hear, that lets them smile and think happy thoughts about you and your family. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":529463292,"authorName":"","from":"sherryfranklin150@...","profile":"sherryfranklin150","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Preparing to answer questions","postDate":"1375386740","msgId":71861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzNzUzODY3NDAuMTAzOTUuWWFob29NYWlsSW9zTW9iaWxlQHdlYjEyMTEwNi5tYWlsLm5lMS55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":71872,"prevInTime":71860,"nextInTime":71862,"topicId":71861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, This is my first post.

I have been reading a lot and trying a little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We moved our family to Ecuador a little over a year ago and after about three months of homeschooling on my own and failing we have started to unschool in earnest.  In the deschooling phase right now.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In September my two children, both age 9, and I will go back to Ohio for our first visit.  I am terrible at answering on the spot questions so I want to prepare myself and be armed with appropriate responses to the question, &quot;So, what are they learning?&quot;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right now they spend just about every waking minute on the computer playing Animal Jam or making videos with their LPS and Legos, and listening to music.
