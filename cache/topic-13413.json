It&#39;s not that mom isn&#39;t aware that there<br/>\nis a problem.  She knows darn well there&#39;s a problem; I&#39;M the problem.<br/>\nLately, I&#39;ve been using the disconnect act.  This is only on the phone; I<br/>\nhaven&#39;t been home in a while.  Ask me in August how the week at home went.<br/>\nBut basically I&#39;ve been staying calm and never answering her criticisms.  I<br/>\nfigure we&#39;ve been playing her games for years, so now we&#39;re playing mine.<br/>\nAt least I control this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe starts in about curriculum, and I reply about how happy I am with his<br/>\nviolin playing and how exciting it is for us to make music together.  She<br/>\ncarries on about how much he&#39;s missing at school, and I talk about the<br/>\ndelightful trips we&#39;ve taken lately.  When she repeats herself and asks if I<br/>\nheard her, I&#39;ve been saying, &quot;Oh, yes, of course I did&quot; and breezing off to<br/>\nanother topic.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick for me is to not defend myself (I never win anyway) and to not<br/>\nstay on her topic.  I do NOT mention that Tim does go to school for 45<br/>\nminutes a week when she&#39;s on the school discourse, I talk about something<br/>\ntotally different.  The 45 minutes at school will be a lovely reply to the<br/>\nfood conversation, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda<br/>\nP.S. to anyone who was around unschoolingdotcom last year: remember my<br/>\nmother and the &quot;your son is missing so much without the book discussions at<br/>\nschool&quot; problem last year?  That&#39;s become her big concern again.  It didn&#39;t<br/>\nbother me this time, but I think I&#39;ll have to keep track and see if it&#39;s an<br/>\nannual &quot;April&quot; problem.  ;)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":96795689,"authorName":"Tuckervill@aol.com","from":"Tuckervill@...","profile":"tuckervill","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Pushing Team Sports","postDate":"1050020587","msgId":13461,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDc2LjJjNjQxYWRhLjJiYzc2NGViQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":13459,"nextInTopic":13515,"prevInTime":13460,"nextInTime":13462,"topicId":13413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/10/2003 11:54:55 AM Central Daylight Time, ...

Around here, aside <br/>\nfrom YMCA or church leagues, it&#39;s the least competitive, most inclusive <br/>\nleague.  The players are evaluated at the beginning of the season and each <br/>\nteam has the same number of kids in each playing ability.  This gives every <br/>\nteam a chance to win some and lose some.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you can&#39;t do anything about the types of people who bring their <br/>\nkids to play baseball.  But if you live in even a medium sized city, and your <br/>\nson would like to try baseball again, you might want to check around and find <br/>\nanother type of league.  Almost any Baptist church with a ball field out back <br/>\nhas a league.  There&#39;s even a league here that uses only different colored <br/>\njerseys and doesn&#39;t keep score.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my 15th spring at the ballpark, watching one or the other of my sons <br/>\nplay ball.  Each of my 3 have had different reasons for playing, different <br/>\nabilities and different ambitions--plus we move a lot--so we&#39;ve been a part <br/>\nof all types of leagues.

Reminds me a bit about <br/>\nsomething Alice Miller wrote once. She was talking about how the people <br/>\nin Germany related to Hitler in a way that the outside world didn&#39;t <br/>\ncomprehend; to outsiders he appeared a hysterical and comic figure but <br/>\nto a majority of Germans his ranting and posturing hit an internal chord <br/>\n  that was tied into the highly coercive and judgmental early childhood <br/>\nexperiences many of them had in common. They literally could not &quot;see&quot; <br/>\nhim because what they saw was how he was packaged, how the message was <br/>\ndelivered in ways that they had been taught as children to see as how <br/>\nloving authorities acted and to deny their own internal truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, I think this happens in all cultures.  Whenever we teach our <br/>\nchildren to deny their own inner truth or tell them something that isn&#39;t <br/>\ngood for them is, or manipulate them to gain something  at the cost of <br/>\ntheir inner feelings, we breakdown that inner wall of protection and <br/>\nmake them vulnerable to exploitation from someone with that same sort of <br/>\n&quot;face&quot;: The smiling face of loving kindness hiding lies and hurt. Child <br/>\nMolesters exploit this when they &quot;prep&quot; their victims, sometimes with <br/>\nthe parents in unknowing partnership, the child feels something wrong <br/>\nand resists, the parents tell them to &quot;be nice&quot; to Uncle Johnny and the <br/>\nchild denies the sense of danger or unease that his gut is telling him <br/>\nand obeys.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it seems darn near impossible to change that in one&#39;s own self. The <br/>\nlessons are taught so young that I think we always remain a bit <br/>\nvulnerable to the picture of that smiling face no matter how hard we try <br/>\nto overlay that early emotional training with logic and calm truth. We <br/>\nremain particularly vulnerable to it with members of our own families <br/>\nsince we&#39;ve been indoctrinated into it for so long.<br/>\n<br/>\n From the website:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;You are a native speaker of English; you know when you are under verbal <br/>\nattack because you feel it, in exactly the same way that you feel it <br/>\nwhen somebody hits you. Don&#39;t be confused: Know that you are under attack.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is SO true. You feel it. But you&#39;ve spent years learning to deny it <br/>\nand when it comes with the face of love and all that you depend on for <br/>\nsurvival as a young child it is pretty hard to ignore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPeggy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n______________________________</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":896746,"authorName":"kbcdlovejo@aol.com","from":"kbcdlovejo@...","profile":"kellyinsc","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] more verbal self-defense","postDate":"1049997952","msgId":13437,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyNy4yNmU2ZGNkNi4yYmM3MGM4MEBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":13436,"nextInTopic":13440,"prevInTime":13436,"nextInTime":13438,"topicId":13413,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/10/2003 9:35:25 AM Eastern Daylight Time, ...
