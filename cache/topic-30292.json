He often gets so focused on his wants and needs he does not notice other&#39;s needs, he is not good at reading body language and often becomes so engrossed in what he is focused on that he just does not notice what he is doing and it&#39;s effects on others.  He is a very kind person, being helpful to others, etc.  It&#39;s the excessive talking that gets him into &quot;trouble&quot; in groups / classes.  He will want to discuss and dissect every conversation - every bit of information.  He will try to monopolize the conversation with you, the teacher/adult, if given half a chance.<br/>\n<br/>\nEd (dad) will be bringing him to class. I think we will approach this with dad attending the class too - to help guide Zac - to be his partner in the learning / class.  In the past we thought he would learn social skills by being in social situations - We now realize that he is not &quot;getting it&quot; due to being unaware - we gleaned this through observations and discussions with Zac.  We have given it a lot of thought and study recently and feel that if dad is with him and can coach / work with him in the moment that might help Zac as well as the teacher and the other students.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf at any time you have concerns please address them with his dad - we continually work with Zac on his social skills and group skills but he can just be so unaware at times.  If you feel comfortable in having a kind, compassionate discussion at some point with him about not always getting a turn, holding his thoughts, not every thought that jumps into his head has to jump out of his mouth, being aware of the others in the group, that would be fine with us.  If you talk with him and not at him, I believe he would truly listen and try.<br/>\n<br/>\nRespectfully,<br/>\nEd & Lisa <br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the teacher&#39;s reply:<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for sharing this with me.  I have a son, 16, who is also a talker, he is hard to keep on track, but when something interests him, he is almost obsessive about it.  I don&#39;t mean to imply that my son and your Zac are &quot;the same,&quot; but I really do understand what you are trying to tell me and I appreciate it so much. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is fine with me that Ed is going to come to the class.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe format of the class is such that I read a myth (2 if they are shorter ones) and we do a project based on that myth.  We also get into the family tree of the gods, a few fun puzzles and and word searches, and some language and vocabulary, since so much of our language comes from the Greek and Latin. We even do a little astrology (Pegasus.) So, there is an amount of time that will be spent being quiet and listening.  When we do, for instance, the language portion, I will present the Greek/Latin word or prefix and challenge the class to come up with the word or words that have that root. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        (here is the part that is causing conflicting thoughts for us and we would appreciate thoughts from the group before we reply to the teacher.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an idea.  If Zac knows a lot about mythology, would he like to bring an interesting fact or tidbit of information to class each week?  It could be his &quot;payoff&quot; so to speak, for complying with the behavior expectations.  I could give him the last 5 minutes of each class to present something?  What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I met your Zac.  I was at the coffee house several weeks ago with my son.  There was a Zac there and he had made a wooden sword.  Was that your son?   (it was)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thank you so much for your input.  I will save your email and reread it before the class starts so what you told me is fresh in my mind.  I am really looking forward to this class and to meeting your son.  If you have further concerns, please contact me via email or phone. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30233,"nextTopicId":30201}}
