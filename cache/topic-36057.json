I also write and publish a monthly program for providers and<br/>\n&gt; homeschoolers.  I am considering stopping the childcare but will definitely<br/>\n&gt; continue the writing. I worry that I will be taking on too much and I do<br/>\n&gt; not<br/>\n&gt; want the girls to feel like I am not focused on them or their schooling.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; I look forward to hearing any pearls of wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHa! don&#39;t know if I have pearls, but here are some tips. These are from many<br/>\nof my coworkers as well. I work for Sun Microsystems, which has an<br/>\naggressive work-from-home policy. Veeeeeeeeery family friendly, I totally<br/>\nlove it. Also, my DH is a SAHD so that changes the dynamic a bit from where<br/>\nyou are. But here we go...<br/>\n<br/>\n* Show the kids what you&#39;re doing, how you&#39;re doing it, and why you&#39;re doing<br/>\nit. Let them sit on your lap or around you while you type, read what you&#39;re<br/>\nwriting to them, explain what you&#39;re thinking, ask them for their thoughts.<br/>\nMy kids now know about Java programming, about Duke the Java mascot, and<br/>\nabout Sun&#39;s dismal stock price (although they have no idea what that means,<br/>\nonly that today&#39;s number is smaller and we wish it were bigger...)<br/>\n<br/>\n* If you have the option, set it up so they can &quot;work&quot; while you work. The<br/>\nboys have their own laptop which we are helping them learn to navigate. Most<br/>\nof the time they watch videos while I work, if they&#39;re in the room with me.<br/>\nBut sometimes Rowan will ask for a blank sheet in a word processor<br/>\n(OpenOffice) and type while I type. Lots of great opportunities there.<br/>\n<br/>\n* For times when you need to focus... wear a badge. My kids know that when<br/>\nthe badge is on, I really have to focus, that it will be for a very short<br/>\ntime, and that I am available to them right after. I try to plan ahead and<br/>\ndoublecheck that they are involved in something entertaining (coloring, leap<br/>\npad, computer, playdough) and have eaten or have food available before I go<br/>\nturtle.<br/>\n<br/>\n* They know that a headset means I&#39;m in a meeting. We&#39;ve played with the<br/>\nheadset for calling Grandma, played with the mute button, etc. They know<br/>\nthey can come in and cuddle or whatever, but that they have to be really<br/>\nquiet. It&#39;s almost a game to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Jason tends to take them out to the park or whatever when I have big<br/>\nprojects and big deadlines. If I don&#39;t, they do whatever they do. If they&#39;ve<br/>\ngot awesome plans, I move my work schedule around and go with.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I have gotten really used to working in 10 minute focused bursts with<br/>\nstories, snacks, and whatnot inbetween.<br/>\n<br/>\nHTH!<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~~L!<br/>\n<br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\nWriting here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/\">http://www.theexcellentadventure.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEvolving here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.consciouswoman.org/\">http://www.consciouswoman.org/</a><br/>\n~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~ ~ * ~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":189394684,"authorName":"Arp Laszlo","from":"&quot;Arp Laszlo&quot; &lt;arphaus@...&gt;","profile":"arp_laszlo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] WAHM Homeschoolers?","postDate":"1215177326","msgId":36112,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDk1MzM1NmE3MDgwNzA0MDYxNXY1Mjg0ZTBmM2pjMjYyMmY2ZThlNGQ1MWE5QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDgwNzA0MDI0MTM1LkRGTFYzNTMzLmFhcnBydjA0LmNoYXJ0ZXIubmV0QEVTdHJhaXRvblBDPg==","referencesHeader":"PDk1MzM1NmE3MDgwNzAyMjAwOHExMzc4ZTFhYnE3M2NmOTE3ZDhlMmY3NWIwQG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPgkgPDIwMDgwNzA0MDI0MTM1LkRGTFYzNTMzLmFhcnBydjA0LmNoYXJ0ZXIubmV0QEVTdHJhaXRvblBDPg=="},"prevInTopic":36101,"nextInTopic":36115,"prevInTime":36111,"nextInTime":36113,"topicId":36057,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I can describe a bit how my unschooling WAHD action goes, with a 3yr old & a 5 yr old: 1) Realize that getting more than 4 hours of actual work done is near ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-119102096\">I can describe a bit how my unschooling WAHD action goes, with a 3yr old & a<br/>\n5 yr old:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Realize that getting more than 4 hours of actual work done is near<br/>\nimpossible<br/>\n2) Being requested to come see something or read a book is to be expected,<br/>\nat least twice an hour at minimum<br/>\n3) If the kids are asleep or engaged in an activity, get as much work done<br/>\nas possible!<br/>\n4) Count my blessings that my wonderful wife helps to engage the kids and<br/>\nallow me to work<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArp<br/>\n<br/>\n-- <br/>\nArp Laszlo<br/>\nwww.unschoold.com | a place for unschoolers<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On Thu, Jul 3, 2008 at 10:39 PM, Eileen &lt;estraiton@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;   YES of course!!!<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;http://www.littleacornlearning.com/&gt; Little Acorn Learning<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Monthly Nature Guides for Childcare and Homeschool<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &lt;http://eileensplace.blogspot.com/&gt; Our Blog<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; _____<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; From: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com &lt;AlwaysLearning%40yahoogroups.com&gt;[mailto:<br/>\n&gt; AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com &lt;AlwaysLearning%40yahoogroups.com&gt;]<br/>\n&gt; On Behalf Of Arp Laszlo<br/>\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, July 02, 2008 11:09 PM<br/>\n&gt; To: AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com &lt;AlwaysLearning%40yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] WAHM Homeschoolers?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Does an almost WAHD count?<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Arp<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; On Wed, Jul 2, 2008 at 9:10 PM, Eileen &lt;estraiton@charter.<br/>\n&gt; &lt;mailto:estraiton%40charter.net &lt;estraiton%2540charter.net&gt;&gt; net&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear from those of you who successfully homeschool more than<br/>\n&gt; &gt; 2<br/>\n&gt; &gt; children and also work at home.<br/>\n&gt; &gt;<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have four daughters and will likely be homeschooling the youngest<br/>\n&gt; three.<br/>\n&gt; &gt; I have been running a part-time childcare program three days per week out<br/>\n&gt; &gt; of<br/>\n&gt; &gt; my home.
