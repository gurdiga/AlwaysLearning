If you don&#39;t satisfy your ex&#39;s expectations, at least somewhat, you risk loosing the chance to unschool, perhaps completely.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has worked for alleviating my extended families concerns is to keep a blog that documents what our daughter&#39;s life entails...what she&#39;s learning.  Initially, I started it as a record to use for our state-required portfolio, but the added benefit is that my MIL gets to see just how full of learning our lives are!  She&#39;s totally backed off, in fact, she&#39;s come to really appreciate what we&#39;re doing.  Partly, the blog played a big role in that, but so does her seeing our daughter more frequently--the proof is in the (unschooling) pudding!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I&#39;ve done, because I live in a heavily regulated state for home education, is to organize the blog by state-required subjects.  I tag entries as: Reading/Writing/Spelling, Art, Arithmetic,Geography, Health and Physiology, Pennsylvania History, History of the US, Music, Phys Ed, Safety Education (fire safety), Science and these, which I added just for the fun of it: Field Trips, Experiments and Socialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving an iPhone, with a camera, is incredibly helpful for documenting--snapping a few photos and taking a few notes.  DD has begun asking for the camera when there is something she wants to add to the blog.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember reading something Sandra wrote once, about it being some time since she noticed herself tagging (in her mind) activities as learning X, Y or Z, and how freeing that was.  And this is important, I think, if someone is new to unschooling--to get to the point where there isn&#39;t a running commentary in your head all the time......but I think many people need that commentary, at least at first.  If you can provide that for your daughter&#39;s father, perhaps he too, in time, will cease needing it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBrie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":67727291,"authorName":"wtexans","from":"&quot;wtexans&quot; &lt;wtexans@...&gt;","profile":"wtexans","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Parent Opposed to Unschooling/Natural Learning","postDate":"1292844322","msgId":58532,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGllbmVmMitta3FuQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGllbTlsZCs0MW12QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58530,"nextInTopic":58533,"prevInTime":58531,"nextInTime":58533,"topicId":58529,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"===I don t want to change our whole way of being that is working for our immediate family so that my ex-husband can justify P s progress (as he has","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-805604536\">===I don&#39;t want to change our whole way of being that is working for our immediate family so that my ex-husband can &#39;justify&#39; P&#39;s &#39;progress&#39; (as he has demanded proof of) to his family and no doubt himself.===<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, if he pushes against what you are doing with your daughter, that&#39;s going to impact your daughter for sure, and very likely your partner and other child (the tension, more than anything).

(Hiccups experienced at times, as with most relationships). We divorced about 5 yrs ago. Unfortunatelly the introduction of &#39;unschooling&#39; seems to have changed this, for the moment anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure that it is actually &#39;unschooling&#39; that is the cause of his negative reactions though, as he has received negative feedback about &#39;P&#39; being &#39;schooled&#39; at home from his mother, sister and his partner. &#39;Unschooling&#39; has compounded the pressure he feels, I assume.<br/>\n<br/>\nM (my  ex-husband) also looked into alternative schooling methods when P was an infant, she breastfed for 3 yrs, co-slept (still does in same room) and there has never been an issue with attachment parenting until recent years. (As mentioned by Sandra, perhaps it is a case of this style of parenting being abandoned once the child is school age or other particular age/milestone). He has also recently told me where P should sleep in our own home saying it is his right to have a strong opinion about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is happy for her to be &#39;schooled at home&#39;, however not &#39;unschooled&#39; it seems. I have read several times now that if unschooling is causing difficulties in your relationship then perhaps it is not the best route. Our immediate household: my partner and our 2 year old daughter and P, are all happy with our transition (mostly - dad still ambiguous about certain areas, time needed) to unschooling and it has just made such a difference in how we feel on a daily basis and we are really enjoying our freedom especially with the added bonus of consensual parenting.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few months ago I gave M information about unschooling, he briefed over it with not too much enthusiasm however did not object at that time. I think the trigger for him was that recently he wanted P to do swimming lessons and after 2 she decided she did not want to continue. No problem... However he feels that she should be made to do them and &#39;so what&#39; if she doesn&#39;t want to. Obviously I have not forced her to go and she hasn&#39;t. She knows how to swim anyway...?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis had a negative backlash on &#39;unschooling&#39; even though I would not have made her even 3 years ago. I provided more information and many links to pages directly affecting his concerns including consensual parenting and was told that that in particular was a load of &#39;merde.&#39; I thanked him for the opportunity to learn a new word however did not feel myself that it was excrement!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would appreciate any feedback/advice/suggestions about handling this. I don&#39;t want to change our whole way of being that is working for our immediate family so that my ex-husband can &#39;justify&#39; P&#39;s &#39;progress&#39; (as he has demanded proof of) to his family and no doubt himself. There is obviously a lot more around it as with any family dynamic, however some I would rather not rehash either! =) If I can clarify anything though, I will.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, should I consider forcing P to do reading and math lessons (even though I strongly feel this is detrimental to her as a person)to appease her father?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Natarsha</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":58476,"nextTopicId":58489}}
