I don&#39;t see how much, if any, positive learning can happen in an atmosphere of fear and abuse like this. It seems to me that the physical safety of people is more important than unschooling or any other type of education. <br/>\n<br/>\nI read somewhere once that our bodies and brains work on a sort of survival hierarchy. First, we need food and water. Second, we need safety. Only after these very basic survival needs are met can we focus on other pursuits. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s exactly how it went but it was something like that. The point was that our brains don&#39;t have much room for education or art or fun if we are in a constant state of survival stress. In the same way that children cannot learn in school when they are in fear of being bullied, they cannot learn at home if a parent is angry, violent and abusive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see this much different than the situation with the 21 year old adult child being angry and mean toward his younger brother. I get that a parent has more rights or weight, so to speak, than a child but that&#39;s because the parent also has more responsibility. But children deserve to be safe from abusive parents just as much as they deserve to be safe from abusive siblings or strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlysia</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":262895925,"authorName":"rainbow mountains","from":"rainbow mountains &lt;rainmountain1@...&gt;","profile":"rainmountain1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Wanting peace in a marriage","postDate":"1337216513","msgId":67197,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEzMzcyMTY1MTMuNTU2ODguWWFob29NYWlsTW9iaWxlQHdlYjI5NTA1Lm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67195,"nextInTopic":67225,"prevInTime":67196,"nextInTime":67198,"topicId":67160,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"It&#39;s really annoying me, I want to reply to specific bits of all your messages with quotes, but my phone won&#39;t let me.

I will have to wait &#39;til I get home on Friday, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, without that ability: thank you all so much for your replies. They all make so much sense. I LOVED Pam&#39;s post about caring for the little boy in him and remembering he&#39;s doing his best and is damaged too and needs love and support too, even when he&#39;s being horrid. <br/>\n<br/>\nSomeone asked if  unschooling is totally &quot;my idea&quot;. It is but my husband thinks its amazing and sees the sense in it (re learning/ food/choices etc) and tries to tell anyone who will listen about it. <br/>\nHe was brought up very conditionally  and struggles more with the bedtimes/ being positive re behaviour and tends to lean towards scolding/ being negative. <br/>\n<br/>\nPam is right, I Have been building a wall around me and my children . I thought it was what I needed to do to try and protect them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the post you mentioned abuse. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really want to know where to draw the line. He has hit/ pushed/ shoved me/ thrown things for a few years. although not hit for a long time (2 years) and totally knows its unacceptable. I think he won&#39;t do it (hit me) again.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently when angry (so u get an idea of where he is at now)  he has smashed and broken things, while screamibg and yelling (with me asking him to please calm down) wrestled things out of my hands (phones when I try to call for help!), pushed me, threatened me, etc. ( all in front of our daughters)<br/>\n<br/>\nhe has twice grabbed our older daughter (5) and hurt her, but not intentionally (intentionally grabbing to move her somewhere, very angry, but not meaning to really hurt her) Just because he is so so strong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had pushed me down and hit me when holding our baby/toddler, and when I was pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always thought I had to make it clear that violence was unacceptable. I have been really worried if I didn&#39;t my daughters may think it ok to be pushed around by your husband. ( but of course  i know screaming at him doesn&#39;t help! It&#39;s just so hard in the heat of the moment when you&#39;re really scared)<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s why I have always tried to talk to him about it (when hes calmed down) and more recently suggest anger management to try and help him cope better when he gets to boiling point.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is sometimes so gentle and loving and lovely when calm, so if I can learn to not get angry with him when he is grumpy or mean to our 5year old, instead of defending her, things should hopefully not escalate to this level. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that&#39;s what you&#39;re all suggesting;To let him be able to make mistakes without me jumping on his back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI worry about our daughter though. She really fights him when he gets angry with her , and I do worry about when she&#39;s older if things could progress to another level. But hopefully if I am a better role model for her that will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts difficult when he walks in from being out. it gets all tense as Jazzy (5) goes from happy and gentle and connected with me, to stressed and lashing out at her sister as I put my attention on him. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe requires lots of love and listening and attention when he walks in from work and forgets the girls are there, wanting his and my attention and it&#39;s challenging to keep the peace. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do try and involve everybody in the conversations and keep everybody happy and &quot;up&quot; but if I&#39;m not feeling good or am tired or ill it all goes to pot. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has felt like a pressure on me for years is that the entire possibility of happiness of my family and mental balanced-ness of my husband relies on me being 100 percent strong and happy at all times!<br/>\n<br/>\n Recently I have been finding it overwhelming and feeling like I have to choose who to support, otherwise I am just refereeing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve been choosing him, hence the more arguments between the girls and angrier daddy ( at their fighting) so it&#39;s not been working and has got to me being here asking for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow do I support everyone and make them all feel loved up and happy and full and keep the peace without me feeling burnt out and overwhelmed!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry my messages are so long, it&#39;s so late by the time the girls are asleep and I can get online, and I&#39;m tired. I hope it&#39;s not too waffly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for reading/ answering, it&#39;s all helping me so much to find clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSam (with Jazzy 5 & Ayla 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Wanting peace in a marriage","postDate":"1337199378","msgId":67195,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhPQnRoWk93aGdPUHdieU45Q0tnNT1zcU1LaE1SYTRyWWRyOGVEZEd2azNDZ0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzcxOTYyMjMuOTQyMTIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzcxNzYwMjguNzg3NDMuWWFob29NYWlsTW9iaWxlQHdlYjI5NTAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4JPENBT09UYVhOQ2g5PXEyQmdkYzVWelVoa2tvMV9IaHR0M1RxdkRTNGktK3N2MUJKdjJ1Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4JPDEzMzcxOTYyMjMuOTQyMTIuWWFob29NYWlsTmVvQHdlYjgxNTA0Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67193,"nextInTopic":67197,"prevInTime":67194,"nextInTime":67196,"topicId":67160,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"On Wed, May 16, 2012 at 12:23 PM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-2097273215\">On Wed, May 16, 2012 at 12:23 PM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polykowholsteins@...\">polykowholsteins@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; A change of country and culture is a big think in someone&#39;s life.<br/>\n&gt; Not having his family and old friends close by can take a toll.

Be gentler and more supportive of him As He Is rather than trying to teach him to be someone else. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":504505579,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Wanting peace in a marriage","postDate":"1337189361","msgId":67183,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBT09UYVhOQ2g5PXEyQmdkYzVWelVoa2tvMV9IaHR0M1RxdkRTNGktK3N2MUJKdjJ1Z0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDEzMzcxNzYwMjguNzg3NDMuWWFob29NYWlsTW9iaWxlQHdlYjI5NTAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDEzMzcxNzYwMjguNzg3NDMuWWFob29NYWlsTW9iaWxlQHdlYjI5NTAzLm1haWwuaXJkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":67180,"nextInTopic":67184,"prevInTime":67182,"nextInTime":67184,"topicId":67160,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Based on what was written below -- I want to stress that many men do not want to talk about this kind of stuff and the more their wife tries to talk with them","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1754436571\">Based on what was written below -- I want to stress that many men do not<br/>\nwant to talk about this kind of stuff and the more their wife tries to talk<br/>\nwith them about it, the more ashamed they are and the more angry they can<br/>\nbecome at being/feeling shamed. Unless you think he is stupid, he knows the<br/>\ngirls are unhappy with him, he knows for sure YOU are, and he probably has<br/>\nno clue how to make that right and may not really understand why you are<br/>\nall so unhappy with him. It isn&#39;t true that he thinks &quot;there is is no<br/>\nproblem,&quot; because he&#39;s angry a lot - so he knows something is making him<br/>\nangry.  Even to say, &quot;He thinks there is no problem,&quot; is dismissive of his<br/>\nfeelings. It is SO common for women to expect their men to express<br/>\nthemselves the way they (the women) do and it so often makes problems worse<br/>\nand worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are dynamics at play in how men have been raised since boyhood that<br/>\nare pretty common. Here is just an example of the difference between boys<br/>\nand girls/men and women. Boys who cry are very very often encouraged to<br/>\n&quot;man up.&quot; Even if they have a sweet mom who comforts them, the message gets<br/>\nthrough to them loud and clear that men who cry should be embarrassed while<br/>\nwomen who cry get comforted. And, much more commonly, boys who express<br/>\nemotions are shamed, teased, ridiculed, or at the least shushed or avoided<br/>\nby other boys and men even if they have a mom who listens and accepts.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, the little boy is still there, in your husband. Whatever was done<br/>\nto him, he still suffers from it and responds to it and, most like, he is<br/>\nvery very ashamed that he can&#39;t create a happy family. He probably feels<br/>\nvery responsible - he&#39;s probably grown up from boyhood to think that the<br/>\nman is responsible for so much and he&#39;s failing. And every single time you<br/>\ntalk with him about it, he feels like a failure and it feels like you are<br/>\nshaming him and he feels awful and doesn&#39;t know how to make it better and<br/>\nhe&#39;s frustrated and lashes out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m not making excuses for him, I know you&#39;re thinking that he&#39;s a grown-up<br/>\nand &quot;should&quot; get over it and listen to you and do the things you&#39;re telling<br/>\nhim, etc. But you&#39;re telling him to go to counseling where he, again, will<br/>\nbe blamed and shamed (he thinks).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think women often don&#39;t get how awful it is for men to feel shamed. That<br/>\nthey are often acting out of fear OF being shamed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that things won&#39;t get better for you if you can&#39;t find a way to<br/>\nreduce the amount of blaming and shaming that he feels coming his way. And<br/>\nhe&#39;s probably ultra sensitive to it, so you&#39;ll have to really really<br/>\neliminate it. One way is to stop talking to him about it at ALL - it isn&#39;t<br/>\nworking anyway and is very very likely adding to the problem. I know this<br/>\nseems counterintuitive - but you&#39;ve tried what seems obvious, so why not<br/>\ntry something completely different.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about how you could respond to a situation in a way that did NOT in<br/>\nany way point at him and blame him, but that was understanding and kind<br/>\ninstead - or at least relatively neutral.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose he barks at the kids to jump to it and clean up. YOU feel their<br/>\npain - you empathize with them so much that it is immediately a &quot;you and<br/>\nthe girls&quot; against &quot;him&quot; situation. Is there a way you can think of to not<br/>\nfeel that way? Can you be on his side in some way? Can you ignore his tone<br/>\nof voice but respond to his wants by cheerfully saying to the girls, &quot;Hey,<br/>\nc&#39;mon, let&#39;s get this show on the road,&quot; and starting to clean up? Imagine<br/>\nif he barked at them and you smiled and even gave him a little kiss or a<br/>\nsweet touch and said, &quot;Hey, yeah, let&#39;s get moving here girls.&quot; If THAT was<br/>\nyour first reaction, wouldn&#39;t that be different than what you are doing now?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be on his team without adopting his harshness. You don&#39;t have to be<br/>\nagainst him. He isn&#39;t making demands that are outrageous, he is asking for<br/>\nthings that normal everyday conventional parents ask for. Your decision or<br/>\ndesire to be a radical unschooling mom is causing problems for him - a<br/>\nquite conventional dad. But they are his kids too and you have the power to<br/>\nmake everyone&#39;s life easier if you don&#39;t insist on your (unschooly) ways.<br/>\nWhen life is better and calmer and he feels less under attack, he may be<br/>\nable to see how your ways work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the mom/wife has that deeper understanding of what is making him<br/>\nbehave as he does, it is very possible she can respond differently and that<br/>\nthings will get better. I&#39;ve seen it happen!! It doesn&#39;t mean she jumps in<br/>\nand acts LIKE him - but she doesn&#39;t build a wall around herself and her<br/>\nkids to protect them from the monster/dad, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deeper understanding and caring must come first, otherwise all the<br/>\nsuggestions we might make here will sound just like we&#39;re saying she should<br/>\nbe pandering to his unreasonable demands and ignoring his bad behavior. But<br/>\nwhen we remember that the man in our life has a little boy inside him who<br/>\nis afraid and ashamed and frustrated, and we love that little boy and care<br/>\nabout him, we can so much more easily defuse situations because we&#39;re<br/>\noperating from love and caring about HIM, too, not just about ourselves and<br/>\nour children. That changes everything - it makes such a huge difference. We<br/>\ncan&#39;t give someone a recipe - &quot;things they can do&quot; to change their<br/>\nhusband&#39;s behavior when he is reacting to the reality that his wife and<br/>\nchildren blame him and think he is wrong and bad and that they want to shut<br/>\nhim out and get away from him. That attitude surely comes through loud and<br/>\nclear and it is as much &quot;the problem,&quot; as his behavior.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, if he is actually threatening - that&#39;s different. I&#39;m not<br/>\ntalking at all about an actually abusive parent, but a more conventional<br/>\nparent who is expressing their feelings of shame and embarrassment and<br/>\nfrustration as angry outbursts and demands.<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Wed, May 16, 2012 at 6:47 AM, rainbow mountains &lt;<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:rainmountain1@...\">rainmountain1@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I have implored him over and over after a &quot;blow up&quot; to get counselling.

It feels so much for me and I get anxious about him getting cross about things.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hear that you are feeling extremely emotionally stretched right now. You are trying to be loving and giving with your kids and also manage your husband&#39;s short temper. The emotional environment of your home is volatile, and spirals downwards quickly as your anger feeds off your husband&#39;s anger. It is so easy for this to happen, for one incident to bring out negativity all round.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I use for dealing with this is to not feed the angst. Don&#39;t respond to your husband&#39;s anger with more anger. Easy to say, but how?! By taking a deep breath before you speak. Let the angry words flare up in your mind and then fade before they come out of your mouth. Set an example that your husband may come to follow. Show through your own restraint that uncontrolled expressions of anger are not an acceptable way to communicate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to be able to maintain your equilibrium in moments of stress, you are going to need powerful inner resources. And they come from improving your parenting a little every day. Each time you respond to your daughters with a happy &#39;yes!&#39;, each time you hold them close and kiss their hair, you build up a sense of confidence, calm and joy. It takes time. But little by little, every day, you can make profound changes to your sense of self. You can heal past hurts. And, crucially, you can prevent hurt to your children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   I know I&#39;ve not been mentally present enough recently.

If the little one touches something of hers, or if I am cooking or doing a quick chore or taking a phone call. I do try and separate them, each with something separate to do if i have something to do, or come cook with me etc but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t work out.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne suggestion is to have more time out of the house. Lots of play at the local park, visiting friends, going to the museum, joining a kids music group etc. If they&#39;ve had a fun-filled day, it&#39;s quite likely they&#39;ll be happy to chill out watching tv while you cook. Use your knowledge of their varying energy levels to plan for busy times and quiet times.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I found it really hard to cope with the guilt i felt at having another child. It tore me up for a long time how i couldn&#39;t be there for my first daughter exclusively any more. I know all this impacted on her.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Having 2 or more little kids is busy! Your resources are stretched. But the more you can give them both the attention they need, the more you create an environment in which a wonderful sibling relationship can flourish. My girls are 7 and nearly 5, and absolutely would not be without each other. Yes, there are arguments (usually over wanting the same toy), but these are resolved quickly because I am there to help - and now they are actually starting to come up with their own solutions once I have calmed the situation down. But I estimate around 80% of the time their relationship is extremely loving. I have precious photos of my younger daughter asleep on her sister&#39;s shoulder, and am sometimes moved to tears when I see them cuddling each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes its all so lovely and flows. But at times it&#39;s been horrible. Sometimes it&#39;s calm but there have been many arguments, some violent (on his part), all frightening.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Would your husband be open to some counselling? Or perhaps a men&#39;s group that deals with family relationships? His relationship with his daughters is crucial in their development. If he can work on ways to deal with his anger, and you can create a peaceful environment that he looks forward to coming home to, these incidences of scary horrible fighting will lessen. In a calm moment, tell your husband that his temper frightens you and the kids.

My marriage and my daughters behaviour. <br/>\n<br/>\n We have been unschooling for almost 2 years and were relaxed in many areas before that. Our daughters are 5&2.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have been trying to keep our family together (having read Sandras pages on marriage/spouses) but something is going very wrong .My husband is needy and gets cross and hurt so easily, I feel I can&#39;t meet his needs and the needs of our children (at the same time). It feels so much for me and I get anxious about him getting cross about things.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have been shouting too much recently and impatient with my 5 year old daughter as she hits and hurts her sister (2.5) I have been talking n explaining with her for so long about this (i know, prob too many words)and she understands and is sorry after, but she keeps doing it in the heat of the moment.<br/>\n I have got to the point where i have been shouting and making threats ( about what will have to happen if she doesn&#39;t stop hitting; spending time  with my mum to separate her from her sister) not good I know, but I&#39;ve been so stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I&#39;ve not been mentally present enough recently. I know she has been bored n unhappy sometimes n that has caused her to lash out. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey have lots of lovely play time together every day but the hitting happens regularly. If the little one touches something of hers, or if I am cooking or doing a quick chore or taking a phone call. <br/>\nI do try and separate them, each with something separate to do if i have something to do, or come cook with me etc but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t work out. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it is when I&#39;m right there playing with them both. I try to keep all her things safe n separate, but sometimes we all play with stuff together (eg each with their own toy but in the same game) little curious 2yo reaches out to 5yo stuff. She lashes out so fast I often fail to get between them n protect my youngest :( it has been happening so long I have now got to serious crossness point with her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI feel helpless n devoid of ideas about how to handle it in the heat of the moment, and after. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe history for her is; I  used to be mean to her when she was 2and 3 and i was pregnant with her sister . I shouted at her and found it difficult to cope :( I suffered from depression and was housebound n so tired when pregnant, then had pnd after the birth. <br/>\nI found it really hard to cope with the guilt i felt at having another child. It tore me up for a long time how i couldn&#39;t be there for my first daughter Exclusively any more. I know all this impacted on her. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe also started nursery for a few months which did not go well and was stressful for me and her. <br/>\n<br/>\nI Had therapy, n lots of help from unschooling  lists has helped me to become much more joyful and balanced, calm and peaceful. <br/>\nbut my relationship with their father has been stressful. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts been hard since he came to this country (UK) when our oldest was 5 weeks old. (he couldn&#39;t get a visa to visit &#39;til then) I had been alone and upset through the pregnancy and had so many negative feelings and fears  built up when he finally (from Turkey) arrived to meet his (biological ) daughter. <br/>\nWe have tried to build us a family , its so important to us both. my parents were not together (his neither) and I really wanted my babies to have different. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes its all so lovely and flows. But at times it&#39;s been horrible. Sometimes it&#39;s calm but there have been many arguments, some violent (on his part), all frightening. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen he loses his temper it is frightening, then I panic and lose mine (shout at him). Very scary for the kids, and me. I hate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship can be unpredictable ( if I&#39;m not really cheery n energy giving to him) I feel tired of it and want a break, peace for me and my children. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if i have enough energy to keep it (my marriage and all it demands) on track and be the kind of mother I want to be. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love my husband and want my family to be together.He doesn&#39;t lose his temper often n is lovely most of the time. But past hurts (with him) plus all the rejection n stress i have had in my life before this relationship make it hard for me to trust and relax in this relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n  I have had enough of the fights and can&#39;t seem to stop them, No matter how much we&#39;ve talked n agreed to change. sometimes im just grouchy n then he loses his temper at our 5yo . Or he is tired and loses his temper despite how I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want my children to be safe n happy and live in a calm happy environment. I wish this could be within our unschooling family, but something is just going wrong. I am sad and scared at the thought of ending our marriage, but don&#39;t know what else to do.  It can be so lovely but the arguments are so scary and unsettling for us all. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy mother was very emotionally unavailable and separate from me and very much wanted to do her own thing, until I was 12 when she abandoned me completely and I went to live with my dad & step mum, who I wasn&#39;t close to. I sometimes feel crowded in my family n need my own space (which i rarely get!) i worry that i am being like her. we are friends now by the way  and she has a good (ish) relationship with the girls.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso maybe how she was affects my ability to connect properly with my marriage? (sometimes i feel overwhelmed and it feels too much n then i get grouchy)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to really fight sometimes to stay present with my children too, my mind wants to wander off frequently!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry this is so, so many words. It has all been rattling around in my brain for so long, I needed to get it out to try to get some perspective. Thank you so much if you&#39;ve read this far and for any advice you could offer me.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67176,"nextTopicId":67250}}
