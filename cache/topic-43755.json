I remember one time, when I was in my 20s my parents came home early from a trip to Russia. Later on, I figured out what was going on, he had anxiety issues & probably issues w/depression as well. It was frustrating & confusing to me to ask him &quot;what&#39;s the matter?&quot; only to get &quot;I don&#39;t feel good&quot; without knowing what he MEANT by that...

My father-in-law had died about three years prior, his <br/>\nyoung wife unexpectedly 18 months later, and finally my mother, called Nan, <br/>\nthe following January after a cancer diagnosis. Of all of these, my mother <br/>\nis the person with whom Jayn had the closest relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Grandpa Jim died I was surprised by Jayn&#39;s absolute conviction that, <br/>\neven though he had gone for ever, he &quot;still loved her&quot;. Over the years she <br/>\nwould sometimes inform us out of the blue that she was sad that Grandpa Jim <br/>\nwas dead, but glad that he still loved her. When Grandma Paula died, she <br/>\nmaintained the same belief. This was despite a total lack of evidence of <br/>\nlove from Paula&#39;s behavior in life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Nan became ill, Jayn, slightly older, was able to articulate her <br/>\nspiritual beliefs to me in greater detail. I told Jayn truthfully that Nan <br/>\nwas very sick, but that we were going to visit her at Christmas. Jayn asked <br/>\nif Nan would die, and was temporarily confused about when, concerned that <br/>\n&quot;soon&quot; meant immediately. She had a big cry, and told me repeatedly that she <br/>\nwould be very sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the time leading up to our last Christmas with Nan, Jayn expressed her <br/>\nidea that a person&#39;s spirit would leave their body and go into &quot;our <br/>\nhearts&quot; - the hearts of the people who loved them - so that we could still <br/>\nlove and remember them, and they would still love us.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn prepared a special joyful dance to be her Yuletide gift to Nan, who had <br/>\nbeen a professional dancer and singer all her life. She practiced <br/>\ndiligently, and had planned to do it, in a costume, on Christmas morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever when we arrived at the house after a cross country drive, a week <br/>\nbefore Christmas, Jayn took one look at Nan reclining in bed, then went out <br/>\nand immediately took off her skirt and shoes, so that she was wearing only <br/>\nher pink tights and perfectly matching top. She then asked me to put on her <br/>\nchosen music and announced that she would do her dance right now. After a <br/>\nfew minutes getting organized, Jayn danced, adapting her exuberance to the <br/>\nlimited space in the bedroom. The appreciative audience was Nan, Grandpa, <br/>\none of Nan&#39;s dearest friends, Daddy and me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow, in those first few moments, Jayn knew that my mother would not be <br/>\nleaving her bed again - not for any meals or to be able to watch the dance <br/>\nin the living room as planned. Somehow she knew that Nan was slipping away. <br/>\nIn the week that followed, the decline was so swift that she would not have <br/>\neven registered Jayn&#39;s presence, had we waited until December 25th. Somehow <br/>\nJayn understood before any of the adults there, that this was the last <br/>\nchance she would have to give this gift to my mother, and to the rest of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome time later my step father asked me to disperse my mother&#39;s ashes in the <br/>\nPacific Ocean, as per her request. He sent us the remarkably heavy container <br/>\nand James, Jayn and I went on a road trip to the coast north of Santa <br/>\nBarbara, near a little town called Cambria which is precisely the kind of <br/>\nsweet, pretty little artist&#39;s colony that Mum had always yearned to live in. <br/>\nWe first visited a ceramic shop where Jayn chose a tiny handmade porcelain <br/>\nvessel with cork to keep a portion of the ashes. (These now reside in our <br/>\nhouse in the excellent company of a bit of James Coburn and a bit of Hannah <br/>\nJenner.) It was very important to Jayn to keep a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe went to the chosen secluded beach. While we were opening the container we <br/>\nwere joined by a large black crow, who watched us most intently. We threw <br/>\nthe ashes out over the water and into the waves as they rushed onto the <br/>\nsand, filming for Grandpa&#39;s sake. The ashes were very black and crystalline. <br/>\nThe sea took the last of them, and then the crow gave a loud squawk and flew <br/>\noff. This captured Jayn&#39;s imagination at the time and seemed very fitting <br/>\nsomehow (although I daresay in reality it was a crow used to the idea that <br/>\npeople often had food with them, but then we didn&#39;t). Still the emotional <br/>\nmoment was enhanced by the avian witness.<br/>\n<br/>\nJayn has no problem holding in her mind the idea that Nan is both in her <br/>\nheart and in our house and travelling the ocean visiting all the places she <br/>\nloved - Australia, Hong Kong, here, even Galveston (not that she loved it <br/>\nthere), Tahiti, Fiji. Every now and then she says she misses her, and I tell <br/>\nher that I know Nan would have been so proud of Jayn&#39;s different doings and <br/>\nachievements and would have loved to be part of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Then, when the cancer recurred, mother-<br/>\nin-law told us not to tell the kids.  And the kids would every so often<br/>\nsay things along the lines of, &quot;I&#39;m so glad Grandma&#39;s cancer didn&#39;t come <br/>\nback.&quot;  My silence in the face of statements like that was a lie.  Or,<br/>\nit really feels like one, anyway.  To me and to DD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the reasoning...  The prognosis was poor--only 5% of<br/>\npatients survive five years--but mother-in-law is an optimist and <br/>\nbelieves in the power of positive thinking and is into living in the now <br/>\nand did not want the now to always be darkened by the cloud of the<br/>\nfuture.  She wanted to believe she&#39;d live the full five years, and<br/>\nfive years is an eternity for a child, so why let a child worry for<br/>\npractically an eternity, about something the child cannot change?<br/>\nSo, two reasons.  She did not want to live out her last years being<br/>\npitied and fretted over, and she did not want her grandchildren<br/>\nto spend a good portion of their childhoods fretting about a<br/>\nsad reality they could do nothing about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought those were good reasons, until MIL took a turn<br/>\nfor the worse and the prognosis worsened to the point that<br/>\nI knew that our recent visit to her home might very well be<br/>\nthe last time the kids saw her.  (I was wrong; she&#39;s hanging<br/>\nin there and will actually be coming to our home for a few days<br/>\nnext week), but at the time, my feeling was, &quot;This is precious<br/>\ntime, and they have a right to know it.&quot;  So the fact that<br/>\nMIL had a crisis that forced a revelation was a relief to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; And, even if they wished they&#39;d been told sooner, they would have <br/>\n&gt; understood why I didn&#39;t tell them <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>They did understand, but understanding and agreement are not<br/>\nthe same thing, and DD did not agree with my decision to with-<br/>\nhold that information from her. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they wouldn&#39;t generalize it to then suspect me of lying in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Perhaps I am being self-defensive here, but I really don&#39;t think she<br/>\nwas suspicious.  I think she just wanted to be *very* clear to me that<br/>\nshe wants the truth from me, no matter what.  I messed up and<br/>\nshe was calling me on it, saying, in effect, &quot;Let&#39;s not have you make<br/>\nthis mistake again.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; They&#39;d understand that was a unique situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But, it&#39;s not a unique situation.  Death is a universal.  I do believe<br/>\nchildren would fear it less if adults feared it less, and were less<br/>\nsecretive about it.  My kids weren&#39;t *overly* sad during the six<br/>\nmonths from the initial diagnosis until the remission; they were<br/>\nsad and they channeled that into enjoying every moment they <br/>\ngot to spend with their grandmother.  Looking at that truth:  <br/>\nthey could&#39;ve handled the knowledge that the cancer had come<br/>\nback and that Grandma might be around for Bar Mitzvah, but<br/>\ndefinitely would not be attending their weddings or welcoming<br/>\n*their* children into the world.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a case of letting fear dictate choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI *try* to practice mindfulness.

I am not sure how much of our dog&#39;s death he actually understood or that of his goldfish.
