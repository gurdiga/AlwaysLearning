However, I think there <br/>\nis a difference between being &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;frightened&quot;  by something <br/>\nand being &quot;damaged&quot; by it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving someone put their finger in an orafice as a child doesn&#39;t make <br/>\nit the childs&#39; fault certainly, nor does it &quot;damage&quot; them anymore <br/>\nthan getting a shot. The difference is in whether they have the <br/>\nsupport available to be listened to in order to avoid it or <br/>\nunderstand it in the future. The key, I think is whether the child <br/>\nhas the ability or resources (i.e. parents&#39; support or other <br/>\nadvocate) to prevent or avoid it in the future IF the child wishes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHaving no one or no advocate to which one can go for support is what <br/>\nmakes it damaging. Worse yet is if one&#39;s &quot;advocate&quot; is the source. <br/>\nHaving the feeling of being &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;frightened&quot; and recognizing <br/>\nthis in oneself is powerful information upon which to act in the <br/>\nfuture IF you have the choice to do so. Listening to a child&#39;s <br/>\nreactions and allowing him to be in charge of himself, does empower <br/>\nhim. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, I am responsible to model setting limits for myself. These <br/>\nnuances are new for me. I am trying to be aware so that I am <br/>\nnot &quot;permissive&quot; and disreguarding my own boundaries while allowing <br/>\nmy child to be &quot;in charge&quot; of himself. This is a challenge since I am <br/>\nreacting to having had limited oportunities to set boundaries for <br/>\nmyself in childhood. However, this is exactly why I do embrace &quot;my <br/>\nchild is his own boss&quot;.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19718,"nextTopicId":19697}}
