My secret was that I liked grapefruit, and that I had never<br/>\nstrapped him to a high chair and force fed him.  There were many snacks I<br/>\nbought just for me, assuming young wouldn&#39;t eat them.  My salad plate<br/>\ninevitably got hijacked--children leaving the cookies aside to try my<br/>\ncrunchy salad.  If meals are fun and social and by invitation children will<br/>\njoin in.  If you eat monkey plates so will your kids--especially if it is a<br/>\nfamily affair with a tea party to boot!  We had lots of fun tea parties with<br/>\nfun finger foods and candles!<br/>\n<br/>\nRowan is the most adventurous--and I discovered a short time ago homemade<br/>\ngranola was his fav.  The other guys also love homemade granola.  We just<br/>\nmelt some butter, maple syrup and water on low in the oven and spend a<br/>\ncouple of hours mixing it on low heat.  We have added dried cranberries,<br/>\ncurrents, nuts, seeds and coconut.  It is so much fun.  Martin and Crispin<br/>\nenjoy making it and eating it as well!  I assumed my kids preferred bought<br/>\ncereals because they asked for them, until Rowan told me otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;We have never restricted his diet or made him eat anything. For a long<br/>\n </span></blockquote>time, I would let the kids pick &gt;out one or two things a week to add to what<br/>\nI would normally buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also experimented with giving my guys money for food with lots of success<br/>\nand I highly recommend putting the six year old in charge.  Rowan did a<br/>\nfabulous job at about age three of doing the grocery shopping  for our then<br/>\nfamily of three.  You might find yourself eating exotic mushrooms, red<br/>\npeppers, lychee fruit and all kinds of surprises.<br/>\n<br/>\nI &quot;forgot&quot; about this success and it took me a while to twig that I could<br/>\nhave fun with food and kids again.  When Martin shopped with me he was only<br/>\ninterested in buying ice cream and candy, but when he held fifty dollars in<br/>\nhis pocket he was on a menu planning mission.  On those days no ice cream<br/>\nwas bought--but lots of chicken, scallops, shrimp, cheese, and artichokes<br/>\ncame home with us.  Martin doesn&#39;t eat potatoes so of course there were no<br/>\npotatoes bought on his trips to the market.<br/>\n<br/>\nI endorse putting the kids in charge of the food budget!  Please do not try<br/>\nto &quot;manipulate&quot; children into eating what&#39;s &quot;good&quot; for them.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>\nwork.  Instead adopt a healthy diet yourself, and enjoy your food--they will<br/>\nenjoy theirs too, and will mooch all your special treats!<br/>\nMarina<br/>\n-- <br/>\nRent our cottage:  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://davehoward.ca/cottage/\">http://davehoward.ca/cottage/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"sandralynndodd","from":"&quot;sandralynndodd&quot; &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: food","postDate":"1251312666","msgId":46908,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGg3NDA2cStjbGNvQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGg3MmQzbCtlNjE0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":46907,"nextInTopic":46912,"prevInTime":46907,"nextInTime":46909,"topicId":13346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Here are a couple of articles which I hope help:-=- I probably shouldn t have let that post through.

The <br/>\nfirst one continues to be about &quot;getting&quot; the child to eat what the parents <br/>\nthink the child should be eating with a bunch of strategies. It is not <br/>\nreally about helping the picky eater - who probably doesn&#39;t consider him or <br/>\nherself &quot;picky&quot; or in need of any help. Picky is a judgmental adult&#39;s label. <br/>\nIt&#39;s about ways for the parent to feel better about being a good provider of <br/>\nfood or something.

Well my experience is that unschooling parents routinely play with <br/>\ntheir children for as long as their children ask them to - routinely as in <br/>\nmost of the time they make interacting the priority for its own sake, not <br/>\nwith some kind of ulterior motive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second (Aletha&#39;s) is about finding acceptance by trusting your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the first article can be safely ignored as being the nice end of <br/>\nconventional parenting, the second reinforces exactly what long time <br/>\nunschoolers have found.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

He eats mostly things like ice cream, smarties, sprite, and cheetos.  He does eat cereal, pepperoni and yogurt tubes a few times a week. He will occasionally eat chicken fingers, homemade mac and cheese, and every few months a smoothie.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have never restricted his diet or made him eat anything.  For a long time, I would let the kids pick out one or two things a week to add to what I would normally buy.  When what he picked was gone, Samuel would scour the cupboards for foods he liked and might end up with a bowl of sprinkles left over from a birthday.  Or he would look through the cupboards and not find anything he wanted to eat.  I know I can starve him into eating more, but I do not want to do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout two months ago, I started buying everything that Samuel wanted at the the grocery.  I was hoping that if he got excited about food, he would be more willing to eat everything he sometimes eats, and maybe try new things.  He is still only eating a few things.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago used to eat tons a fruit and a few veggies and muffins and cheese.  His diet is now so limited and so low in nutrition I&#39;m not sure how he stays healthy, although he is.  He sometimes has low energy, but I don&#39;t see any other physical problems.  He is almost never sick.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have repeatedly tried monkey platters, but not with much success.  He sticks to the same few choices.  When he does try something, watermelon a few months ago and cheese the other day, he does not like it.  When he was younger he had a lot of allergies but has mostly outgrown them.  His reactions are now very mild or non-existent.  He was allergic to milk, soy, HFCS, and possibly nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would really like some suggestions as I have tried everything I can think of.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAmanda<br/>\nEli 8, Samuel 6</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":185586397,"authorName":"Lyla Wolfenstein","from":"&quot;Lyla Wolfenstein&quot; &lt;lylaw@...&gt;","profile":"lylawolf","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"food","postDate":"1241718627","msgId":44742,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PERCNEU3NTMzMEJDQzQ0RTFCMTlBNzBCOUM3N0ZBQjMwQExZTEFMQVAyPg=="},"prevInTopic":13412,"nextInTopic":46890,"prevInTime":44741,"nextInTime":44743,"topicId":13346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"i wanted to share this experience yesterday, primarily for those on the list who are newer to unschooling, or struggling with truly letting go of food","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1988779316\">i wanted to share this experience yesterday, primarily for those on the list who are newer to unschooling, or struggling with truly letting go of food controls:<br/>\n<br/>\nso, it&#39;s been a year since we embarked on this journey of &quot;radical unschooling&quot; - and when i look back on my blog posts from last year regarding food, i am both struck by how even when i thought i got it, i didn&#39;t, and also by how far my son  has come on this journey himself.  in the last month or so, i have seen a tremendous leap forward in his internal connection to his body in terms of fullness/hunger, sleep/energy, need to move, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\ntoday though, was a perfect illustration of the food &quot;issues&quot; that have dissolved with radical unschooling - and it did take almost a year!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhe has been wanting to go to the olive garden for a long time now, so today, when he asked, i said sure right away - it was a great day for it! so, he and i went, and when we got there, he noticed an amazing looking chocolate lava cake on the menu and asked if he could get it after lunch.  i said sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhe ordered pasta and an italian soda (and chicken that he didn&#39;t end up liking).  he ate some breadsticks and pasta and the italian soda was *so* good, according to him - made with cream!  he drank about 1/3 of it, and then said he was actually too full to finish it, and actually, too full for dessert as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nthis is the kid who previously would have insisted on TWO desserts, asked if the soda was refillable, and drank/ate it all and then gotten a stomach ache.  he didn&#39;t even want to get it to go...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhe has really gotten to a place, i think, where he totally trusts that he will have access to whatever he wants to eat (that is available), whenever, and so doesn&#39;t deny his own hunger, or protien cravings, or desire for fruit, vegies, whatever - nor does he binge on chips or cake - or anything, really.  he eats when he&#39;s hungry or desirous, and stops when he&#39;s done.  it&#39;s a *beautiful thing* and so obvious, i can&#39;t believe it took this long for us to get on board. :) but considering how long it took us (9 years), it seems pretty impressive it only took a year for him to really trust!<br/>\n<br/>\nwarmly, Lyla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":9543528,"authorName":"Dana","from":"&quot;Dana&quot; &lt;hoffmanwilson@...&gt;","profile":"hoffmanwilson","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] food","postDate":"1049918226","msgId":13412,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAyMmEwMWMyZmVkMiQzNDE2ZWM2MCRiOTIxZmE0M0BkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PEJBQjk5NDVBLjIzM0IlYWJ0bGVvQGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQ+"},"prevInTopic":13409,"nextInTopic":44742,"prevInTime":13411,"nextInTime":13413,"topicId":13346,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"One time, we had a gift certificate to a semi-fancy restaurant, and as such money was not an issue (as it often is when we go out).
