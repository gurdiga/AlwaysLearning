This list has tweaked my thinking a bit and now I feel <br/>\nlike it&#39;s okay for me to develop myself, and my kids benefit from seeing me <br/>\ndo interesting things and having an interesting mom. I feel freer to learn <br/>\nItalian online, take my sketchbook when we go to the park or museum and try <br/>\nrecipes that nobody might like but me. Usually it turns out that the kids <br/>\njoin in me in learning a little Italian, drawing their own pictures, or <br/>\nhelping me cook!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few rambling thoughts.<br/>\nAmy Kagey<br/>\nEmail me for a list <br/>\nof used homeschooling books!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":14481,"nextTopicId":14547}}
