My kids were out of the school system<br/>\nshortly after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bet it will pass,  for Holly,  I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing I do like about the unschoolers who are here and and at a few<br/>\nother places---  Is that you would allow her to go if she really wanted to.<br/>\nI&#39;ve met too many homeschoolers who wouldn&#39;t,, and it makes me sick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I have met some unschoolers who say they wouldn&#39;t allow their<br/>\nchildren to go also,  but I really find that contradictory to an unschooling<br/>\nparenting style.   I guess I would question what kind-of &#39;unschooling&#39; they<br/>\ndo.    Forced unschooling??   Hmmmmm......<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh,  and Sandra, tell Marty that I think his costume sounded hilarious!<br/>\nVery creative thinking!  I would have gotten a kick out of seeing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe won&#39;t know me, but you could tell him I waved him down while he was<br/>\nswimming at the conference, to tell him I was stuffing a DVD into your bag.<br/>\nMaybe he&#39;ll remember that,  maybe not.   &lt;g&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelli~ </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":17209,"nextTopicId":17222}}
