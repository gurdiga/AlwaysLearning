Indeed there is a market<br/>\nfor inflatable sheep and indeed there are those<br/>\ncatering to that market.  I have told this story many<br/>\ntimes over the years, so I will share it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in San Francisco and there are a lot of<br/>\nstrange things available there for the,<br/>\nah...discerning connisuer of weirdness I guess.  One<br/>\nday while I was riding the bus to my job downtown, as<br/>\na teen, I passed through the district North of Market<br/>\nSt. which is known for being a somewhat nasty slum. <br/>\nCheap hookers, sex paraphenalia shops, drug addicts<br/>\nand nasty rooms by the hour hotels abounded there,<br/>\namongst less savory things.  It is called,<br/>\nappropriately enough although not by design, the<br/>\nTenderloin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile passing one of the sex shops that was on the<br/>\nsame street as the bus route, and which possessed a<br/>\ntheater style marquee, I happened to read their add<br/>\nrunning on the marquee.  It read &quot;Just In!  New Blow<br/>\nUp Sheep!&quot;  I laughed all the rest of the way to work<br/>\nand have retold the incident many times.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
