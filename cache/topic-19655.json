Parenting consciously is a ongoing growth<br/>\nexperience. &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m probably generalizing discussions from www.unschooling.com and <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com\">unschoolingdiscussions@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe ongoing discussion for years has involved people being aware of why and <br/>\nwhat so they can be makig decisions as clearly as they can, based on principles <br/>\nand priorities.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way, we don&#39;t need to identify the true needs of our children if we give <br/>\nthem enough leeway to indicate by choosing one thing over another how much <br/>\ncloseness they want, how much activity or quiet they want, etc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nI think my kids need safety and a lot of freedom within that safe <br/>\nenvironment.  (Some people&#39;s &quot;safety&quot; would be repression or restriction from my point of <br/>\nview, I know.)  I think they need opportunities and experiences and input, <br/>\nand the right and power to say &quot;No thanks, not now, not that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome &quot;childhood issues&quot; are not &quot;issues&quot; in the sense that they&#39;re emotional <br/>\ninfections.  Some are just calm awarenesses of things we think hindered more <br/>\nthan helped.   Spankings.  Being put to bed in a dark room and made to stay <br/>\nthere even with bad dreams.   Those aren&#39;t &quot;issues&quot; for me, but those things <br/>\nhappened and I decided they were not the way to go.  So am I person who has <br/>\ndecided thoughtlessly to &quot;just&quot; do the opposite of what my mother did?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems more direct to me for people who are talking about unschooling to <br/>\nmove toward what will help their children learn without school, and develop into <br/>\nconfident, happy people.  Whether or not someone&#39;s parents spanked, spanking <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t help with any of that.    Some people don&#39;t spank because their <br/>\nparents didn&#39;t.  Some don&#39;t spank because their parents did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19587,"nextTopicId":19657}}
