Now that he is a toddler, I find I have to be much more","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1964538778\">My son is currently 18 months old, and my husband and I plan to unschool\n him once he is school age. Now that he is a toddler, I find I have to \nbe much more conscious of my parenting behavior because it seems easier \nto slip into conventional parenting than it was when he was an infant...\n for example, saying &quot;no, coffee tables are not for climbing!&quot; rather \nthan to stop and ponder why that must be a rule and if it&#39;s \nnecessary--he&#39;s quite careful when he climbs. My husband and I are \nworking hard to be more respectful and stop controlling/coercing \nbehavior out of our son, and he&#39;s responding to this by being an \nall-around happier child.&nbsp; <br><br>My dilemma, however, is that I run a \nhome daycare... and I wonder now if it is incompatible with unschooling--and I mean unschooling as a parenting philosophy because I realize that he&#39;s not school age yet.\n I chose to open the daycare after my son was born so that we could \nafford for me to stay home with him. I really enjoy doing it. I have a \nsmall group (between 3-5 kids each day, including my son). They all are \nbetween 1.5 and 3 years old. <br><br>I follow the unschooling philosophy as \nmuch as possible with my daycare group. For example, I&#39;ll put art \nsupplies on the table and invite them to use them (not required), and \nthe art projects are always open-ended, rather than &quot;everyone must now \nmake snowmen.&quot; We read books and talk, but I&#39;m not having them recite \nthe alphabet or drilling them on numbers and letters. We have a great, \nhuge playroom with lots of toys and lots of time to explore. So I&#39;m not \nworried that I&#39;m teaching; I believe I am being a good guide and \nresource. <br><br>My concern is more about behavior management, so to \nspeak. The freedom my son is experiencing is not going to be possible to\n give to the daycare children.&nbsp; <br><br>For licensing and liability \nreasons, I just cannot let them climb on the coffee table.&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone \ngot hurt doing an activity like this, even if it was an accident, I \ncould be sued, lose my daycare license, and even get a criminal record \nif the state determines the accident was due to negligence or failing to\n provide a safe environment. The thought of &quot;what if&quot; is very worrisome \nto me. <br><br>That is an extreme example, but even on a smaller \nlevel... I can&#39;t let a daycare child eat only watermelon for lunch (if \nhe asks for it) because I have to take his parents&#39; wishes into \nconsideration. <br><br>I wonder what it will do to my son to see that \nhe--and only he--can climb the coffee table. He--and only he--can have \nunlimited watermelon (because the other kids have to finish their peas).\n This doesn&#39;t seem healthy to me. <br><br>I&#39;d also love to hear about \nunschooling done in a family with many children. Because I have 3-5 kids\n here at a time (and they are all young), I feel like I have to limit \nand control when the daycare kids are here in ways that I don&#39;t \nlimit/control when they are gone... for example, I&#39;d be much more likely\n to give my son free reign with the finger paints when I know I can just\n take him to the tub after... but with 4 other kids to watch (and \npotentially bathe, if everyone gets that messy!), I can&#39;t make choices \nthat would lessen my ability to supervise the group. <br><br>I am \ncurious to hear what others think about our situation. In the summer, I \nplan to go down to doing daycare only 3 days per week. By the time my \nson is of school age, my goal is to be finished with the daycare and to \nable to be home 100%. However, that is at least four years away.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":73153,"nextTopicId":73188}}
