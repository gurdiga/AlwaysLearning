And the comments from some people were <br/>\nfunny. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad told me that &quot;life is hard enough, without saddling your kid with a <br/>\nhard name.&quot; His kids are named John, Steve and Karen. Believe it or not, <br/>\nlots of people think Karen is spelled with a C, and it&#39;s mostly men who make <br/>\nthat error. I guess it reminds them of Carol. My kids are Jake, Jon and Will. <br/>\nJake was pretty exotic for rural Arkansas in 1982, but turned out to be <br/>\npretty popular! 3 Jakes one baseball team when he was 8!<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it&#39;s because it&#39;s in Britian, but I thought it odd that it said <br/>\n&#39;people from New York call her &quot;Sarndra&quot;,&#39; and they spelled with that extra R <br/>\nin the middle. I would have spelled it Sahndra. Later or in the comments <br/>\nthey use an AR in another word where I would have put an AH to denote that <br/>\nsound. R is more of a hard consonant to me, than H.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in Chicago, with a lot of Irish around me. I&#39;ve been interested <br/>\nin dialect and pronunciation ever since I moved from there to Arkansas when I <br/>\nwas 11. <br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n________________________________________________________________________<br/>\n<br/>\nMessage: 6 <br/>\nDate: Thu, 25 Aug 2005 11:23:21 EDT<br/>\nFrom: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:SandraDodd@...\">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>\nSubject: Re: me, in a BBC article<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a message dated 8/25/05 6:30:36 AM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:tuckervill2@...\">tuckervill2@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I suppose it&#39;s because it&#39;s in Britian, but I thought it odd  that it said<br/>\n&gt; &#39;people from New York call her &quot;Sarndra&quot;,&#39; and they  spelled with that extra <br/>\n&gt; R<br/>\n&gt; in the middle.

He couldn&#39;t hear it <br/>\neither at first, but we talked about it and he pronounced the two different <br/>\nways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat he said was clear and true, but over-simplified (but it was a REALLY <br/>\nshort article so that&#39;s understandable). I said older relatives from Texas <br/>\npronounced it all stretched out, and older people from the NE U.S. tended toward <br/>\nthe &quot;Sahndra&quot; version. He left out it being older people. I had said <br/>\npeople younger go with the way I say it maybe because of Sandra Bullock or other <br/>\nSandras being out there and having their names pronounced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way he found me was googling &quot;unpronounceable names&quot; and he got an <br/>\narticle I wrote years ago about SCA naming practices, mostly of local groups, but <br/>\nthe last paragraph was:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonal names are absolutely more personal. If an individual wants to have <br/>\nan unpronounceable name, it&#39;s his or her own business. If an individual wants <br/>\nto have an unpronounceable name and then expect every herald to magically <br/>\ndeduce it and every chronicler to unfailingly spell it, this is about like putting <br/>\na chip on your shoulder and then knocking it off yourself.
