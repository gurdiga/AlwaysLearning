I have suffered from severe <br/>\nperfectionism ever since I can remember.  I&#39;ve had several failures in <br/>\nmy life because of it, including flunking out of 2 colleges, one of <br/>\nwhich was a very fine Ivy League school.  Perfectionism can truly <br/>\nparalyze you.  A bad case of perfectionism along with clinical <br/>\ndepression and very poor self-esteem can really mess you up.  I&#39;m 42 now <br/>\nand I&#39;m much more relaxed.  My house is still a total mess, but even <br/>\nthat is getting better too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a child I was constantly hearing critical statements like:  &quot;If you <br/>\ncan&#39;t do it right then don&#39;t do it at all.&quot;  Things like this along with <br/>\na whole bunch of other issues I&#39;m sure contributed to my problem with <br/>\nperfectionism.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regard to my children, I make sure they understand that mistakes <br/>\nare a part of learning and I never make a big deal about them.  I try <br/>\nnever to criticize them and accept them just the way they are, no matter <br/>\nwhat that may be.  I guess it&#39;s unconditional love and acceptance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have found a great site called FLYlady.com<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure you check it out.  FLY stands for Finally Loving Yourself.  <br/>\nShe helps people like us get a handle on the messes in our houses.  She <br/>\nsends you a bunch of e-mails every day giving you little assignments so <br/>\nthat you can clean up your house and get it under control.  I&#39;m taking <br/>\nit very slowly.  I&#39;m still a Flybaby, but I see an improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\nMimi<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:<br/>\n&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!

I&#39;ve had that thought in my mind a lot lately, now that Kirby is fifteen and talking about driver&#39;s ed. &nbsp;I have no doubt that he&#39;ll be a really good driver, because he&#39;s really good at Nintendo games, and he&#39;s physically cautious in general. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>As some of you come across and watch the new Nintendo Game Cube game Monkeyball, watch what fine movement is required to go through those mazes. &nbsp;I watched Kirby and Marty play it the first time they picked it up and thought &quot;This will make them better drivers.&quot; &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>And before someone snorts and says &quot;That&#39;s not real and cars are,&quot; I will say that I see them care more about keeping a character on an intricate course than some of the drivers I saw yesterday cared about keeping their car in a lane of traffic!\n<br>\n<br>Sandra\n<br></span></blockquote></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":0,"authorName":"PSoroosh@aol.com","from":"PSoroosh@...","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","senderId":"vJIOomzxLnzi13mdHDmT0EYjpivYCwTvwLaM5zdZmr0dH1M3OBRleVcPSe1GMwCiYHGrJ4E7_g","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] fantasy gaming vs real challenges (was Re:  Expensive Ga...","postDate":"1006877530","msgId":39,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQzLjI1ZGVlOWQuMjkzNTE1NWFAYW9sLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":46,"prevInTime":38,"nextInTime":40,"topicId":39,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 11/26/2001 11:06:40 PM Pacific Standard Time, ...

Probably those who have it don&#39;t appreciate it - but it is something that is great for a 12 yo boy to be developing - especially those who don&#39;t yet write comfortably. I&#39;d sure rather have them developing that sense of distance and hand-eye coordination now, then wait until they&#39;re behind the wheel of their first car, for example! &lt;G&gt;\n<br>\n<br>Not that, in my mind, this kind of argument is needed to justify playing the games -- just that they are fun and satisfying to the kid is enough for me, really. I mean, isn&#39;t a lot of our own lives a search for things to do that satisfy us? Sheesh - why do we feel anxious when our kids FIND such things?\n<br>\n<br>--pam</span></blockquote></font></font></html>\n</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":67,"nextTopicId":6}}
