There are a lot of kids that are very good actors, they know how to impress parents.  I&#39;m surprised at how parents fall for that BS.  Chamille gets put into the &quot;bad&quot; kid category by so many parents, partly because of the way she looks, but also partly because she doesn&#39;t put on that show.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still get shocked at times at how young people do these things, but I see it.  Chamille and Cyle tell me all about who does what and where.  Cyle has been deeply shamed by his parents for eliminating many friends from his life.  They blame Chamille for it because Chamille won&#39;t tolerate being around some of those kids.  Any guess why?  Yep, she doesn&#39;t want anything to do with the drugs and drinking.  Cyle doesn&#39;t either.  They&#39;ve created this very small, but very wonderful network of friends.  We call it the quality over quantity network!<br/>\n<br/>\nChamille stopped being friends with a kid that really still wants to be friends with her.  He keeps talking to me about it.  So, every now and again, I bring it up to Chamille.  The last time I mentioned it, she said to me, &quot;mom, I&#39;m happy with the friends that I have.  I don&#39;t need any more.  He&#39;s going to bring too much drama in my life that I don&#39;t want to deal with.&quot;  This is a kid that many parents LOVE because he knows how to put on that show.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] pre-schools for two year olds and why saying &quot;unschooling&quot; could help","postDate":"1254150636","msgId":47675,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEZDOEMzQjUyLUU4REMtNDFFOC05NTFCLTIxQjE3RkQ5OTY1N0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5MEFGQjBELUMyNUYtNEU0RC04Mjg0LTM0MTc2MzQ1MDA0NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDJDMkM3QjFDLUFBREEtNEIyQy1BMjMzLTQzOUM1QTgzNTEwREBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4gPDk5MEFGQjBELUMyNUYtNEU0RC04Mjg0LTM0MTc2MzQ1MDA0NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":47667,"nextInTopic":47684,"prevInTime":47674,"nextInTime":47676,"topicId":47651,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-It s sad that parents believe all those hoops they jump their kids through are necessary.

If soeone  <br/>\nhas paid $6,000 (the cheapest figure they gave on that article) or  <br/>\n$12,000 (as someone has cited her friend as paying lately) for  <br/>\nPREschool, and much more as the kids go through high school, and if  <br/>\ntheir kid ends up working beside, or for, someone who was  <br/>\nunschooled...  Not only will they be PISSED, but they&#39;ll have receipts  <br/>\nto show a lawyer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomewhere down the line these two parallel universes could meet in  <br/>\ncourt and a big challenge come to the pay-per-minute education of  <br/>\nbabies.   IF it helps, groovy.  If it doesn&#39;t help, or if it harms,  <br/>\nthen what?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps, though, that will be the entree that the very-many early- <br/>\nchildhood teachers trained a few years back (probably still) sill  <br/>\nneed.   When headstart was funded for poor kids (an extra year of pre- <br/>\nschool to &quot;catch them up&quot;) it was proveably helpful for their &quot;success  <br/>\nin first grade&quot;.  Sesame Street was funded in those days, early  <br/>\n1970&#39;s, school reform days.   Then people thought &quot;not fair they&#39;re  <br/>\ngetting government education other kids don&#39;t get!&quot;  After that many  <br/>\nstates made kindergarten free and mandatory.  Before the 1980s, few  <br/>\nstates had mandatory kindergarten, as I remember.  Certainly New  <br/>\nMexico didn&#39;t require anything before 1st grade until around then.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":136871563,"authorName":"Schuyler","from":"Schuyler &lt;s.waynforth@...&gt;","profile":"schuyliz2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] pre-schools for two year olds and why saying &quot;unschooling&quot; could help","postDate":"1254133241","msgId":47663,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDQ3MTIxMy4xMzQ2MS5xbUB3ZWI4NjIwOS5tYWlsLmlyZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDk5MEFGQjBELUMyNUYtNEU0RC04Mjg0LTM0MTc2MzQ1MDA0NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","referencesHeader":"PDJDMkM3QjFDLUFBREEtNEIyQy1BMjMzLTQzOUM1QTgzNTEwREBTYW5kcmFEb2RkLmNvbT4gPDk5MEFGQjBELUMyNUYtNEU0RC04Mjg0LTM0MTc2MzQ1MDA0NkB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4="},"prevInTopic":47662,"nextInTopic":47664,"prevInTime":47662,"nextInTime":47664,"topicId":47651,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh, I found that article to send to David and a young girl is quoted as saying this: “Parents are working hard out here and giving their kids all this stuff,","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1429937595\">Oh, I found that article to send to David and a young girl is quoted as saying this: <br/>\n“Parents are working hard out here and giving their kids all this<br/>\nstuff, and still kids are getting hooked,” she said. “I think parents<br/>\nput a blinder over their faces.”<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.
