There is<br/>\na family (can&#39;t remember the name) with five kids who<br/>\nare all pianists.  The kids developed a passion for<br/>\npiano very early on and eventually their school<br/>\nschedule began to conflict with piano, not leaving<br/>\nthem the time they wanted to play.  So the parents&#39;<br/>\nsolution:  Nix School, buy 5 grand pianos.  They stood<br/>\nbehind their children, cheering, all the way, and<br/>\nhomeschooled them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the eldest reached the age for college, she<br/>\nwanted to try for Julliard (spelling?) of course,<br/>\nwhich is so very tough and exclusive and lets so very<br/>\nfew people in every year.  She got in, much to her and<br/>\nher family&#39;s joy.  Then her sister got in, and then<br/>\nanother of the kids, and etc.  Now ALL FIVE are<br/>\nstudying there.  The eldest two girls play together,<br/>\nwhether on one piano or two pianos, in performance. <br/>\nTheir instructors say they have an almost spooky<br/>\nemotional link and know what the other is going to do<br/>\nbefore they do it.  They also look a lot alike.  The<br/>\nothers all have unique and original styles and are all<br/>\noutstanding of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulliard has NEVER had siblings accepted at the same<br/>\ntime before, and certainly never 5 together.  I cannot<br/>\nrecall if they have ever had ANY siblings accepted. <br/>\nBecause it is so remarkable, it was in the news.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did the parents&#39; do when all five kids got<br/>\naccepted?  Well they sold their house and moved near<br/>\nJulliard, so all the kids could live at home and save<br/>\nmoney on the incredible tuition at Julliard.<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
