Sorry, didn&#39;t realised I was replying to a thread about <br/>\nSandra talking about pollution to the list. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I&#39;m gonna flip this to something cheerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kid&#39;s just turned 8, 2 days ago. It&#39;s also the 23rd month of our <br/>\nhomeschooling/ unschooling. My son surprises me all the time with <br/>\nhis understanding of alot of things around him. Like , I said 23rd <br/>\nmonth, he&#39;ll reply 1 yr and 11 months. When it comes to money, he&#39;s <br/>\nlightning speed with how much he&#39;s got, and what he&#39;s gonna buy LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nOur unschooling life is so different from where we started. I feel <br/>\nlike we have come a long way. Hey, what do I know, my &quot;year long <br/>\nholiday break&quot; trick worked, and we have successfully progressed <br/>\ninto almost 2 years of unschooling - and my son is still in one <br/>\npiece, and alive, and has managed to progress many grade ahead of <br/>\nhis peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd surprised surprised, I&#39;m happy and content, and not in an asylum <br/>\nLOL!! <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me share a typical picture of our unschooling life. It is <br/>\nabsolutely sloth-like, just how we like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe wake up and have breakfast. I&#39;m on emails and DS watches tv or <br/>\nplay with his PSP or DS. Currently he&#39;s either playing Lego Batman <br/>\nor training his puppy on NintenDogs. Around lunch time, we&#39;re washed <br/>\nand changed and we continue what we&#39;re doing. DS normally fit in <br/>\nsome Lego building sometime during the day. Sometimes, we both sit <br/>\ndown and go on his Jumpstart or Cluefinders program. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe past weeks he has progressed into the garden, burning stuff. And <br/>\nof course, in the past 1 month, we had his best friend coming over <br/>\ndaily after lunch, so the boys basically just play until it&#39;s dinner <br/>\ntime. Of which DS then goes home to best friend&#39;s house till hubby <br/>\npicks him up at 8.30pm. At the moment, they have managed to convert <br/>\nmy dining table into a whole Lego City, with little buildings and <br/>\ncars and all. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe do go out for long walks to shops and best friend&#39;s house to pick <br/>\nhim up sometimes, but rarely venture out anyway far nowadays because <br/>\nwe&#39;re car-less. The boys are also into skate boarding so this means <br/>\nI&#39;ll have to get the car situation sorted out. <br/>\n<br/>\nTonight is Halloween. My kid&#39;s gone with his bfriend and family to <br/>\nvisit someone else, so I&#39;m feeling lonely and abandoned &lt;sniff <br/>\nsniff&gt;. It strange when you get the house all to yourself and it&#39;s <br/>\nso quiet LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it wn&#39;t be long, the chaos will descent again for the sleepover <br/>\nis in my house tonight !!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy trick-a-treating Everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nBig Higs,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":357843301,"authorName":"lyeping2008","from":"&quot;lyeping2008&quot; &lt;lyeping2008@...&gt;","profile":"lyeping2008","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"School residue - moving on with life.","postDate":"1225464256","msgId":39781,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdlZjVrMCsxa29kQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDcwRjlENkI1LUY3QTAtNDFBNS04RUQ4LUQzRkY4MkRBNTY3NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":39780,"nextInTopic":39783,"prevInTime":39780,"nextInTime":39782,"topicId":39775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Sandra<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I share with my kid. We all make mistakes. It&#39;s part and <br/>\nparcel of life. Every moment of our lives, decisions are made. Some <br/>\nare informed ones, some are not. Some good, some bad. But we can <br/>\nalways try to see the positive side of everything. A lesson in <br/>\ndisguise, is how I approach my bad decisions. Flip the bad, and it&#39;ll <br/>\ntunr over to something good. Always 2 side to evrything.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I honestly cannot say I regret sending my kid to school. Not <br/>\nbecause I&#39;m cruel or heartless but because, how can I regret making <br/>\nthat decision when at that time I seriously thought I was doing the <br/>\nbest I can for my child? I didn&#39;t know any better then.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut because it was a bad decision, and a HUGE one, this means me and <br/>\nmy kid is now very very well informed and wont&#39; be making that same <br/>\nmistake again. So to me, it had to happened for we couldn&#39;t have gone <br/>\ninto homeschooling and unschooling without it happening. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe talked alot about it, somewhere towards the end of our 1st year out <br/>\nof school. It&#39;s ok to talk, it is part and parcel of our learning and <br/>\nliving. <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree it&#39;s not good if one is constantly focusing on the pain and <br/>\nnegativity, and cannot see the positiveness infront of them. So it is <br/>\nimportant to help &quot;contrast that&quot; to the child by pointing out the <br/>\npostiviness and freedom of life now. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt helps to remind them, they&#39;re no longer living in the past, for the <br/>\npast is only images, and cannot hurt them. In the beginning, I find it <br/>\nhelpful to point out the freedom of choice placed infront of my son.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would he want to do now, at this moment? I encouraged him to try <br/>\nto breakout of that box in his mind, and do something radical and non <br/>\nconforming. Afterall, like I tell my son, who&#39;s gonna stop you? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo we not only talk, but we are very pro-active about it too. My son&#39;s <br/>\nidea of freedom and non-conformity means taking a long drive into town <br/>\nto go to Toy-R-us, just because we can and is allowed to LOL!! I do <br/>\nthink at that time, he was also testing MY genuinity, the offer of <br/>\nfreedom of choice LOL!! This is where our unschooling really begins. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe dont&#39; dwell on it but do still talk about it occasionally when he <br/>\nbrings up a certain situation. But it is more of him now doing  <br/>\na &quot;comparison&quot; of some sort, between what we&#39;re happily doing now and <br/>\nwhat they grudgingly had to do in school. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son understands that school was a decision we made, he thought it&#39;s <br/>\na fun decision where else mummy and daddy thought it&#39;s the best <br/>\ndecision. Until we all realised it wasn&#39;t!<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have discarded that bad decision about school, left it behind, and <br/>\nhave moved onto better pasture. We made a decision to homeschool, even <br/>\nthis was discarded in favour of unschooling. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now, we&#39;re more informed and wiser about the life choices and <br/>\nfreedom we have, than we were ever before. And so, live moves on. <br/>\n<br/>\nHugs,<br/>\nSharonBugs.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] pollution","postDate":"1225463888","msgId":39780,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDcxNDM0QzM1LUUwNjItNERGMy05NUY1LUMzNDg5OURBMEY2NUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdlZGxhZysxdjFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdlZGxhZysxdjFsQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39779,"nextInTopic":39781,"prevInTime":39779,"nextInTime":39781,"topicId":39775,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-funny, when I went back and read Tara s posts I really had no idea that we were both essentially on the same page.
