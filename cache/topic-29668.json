She  really wants<br/>\nto ride<br/>\nup there, and I&#39;m inclined to say it&#39;s fine, especially for  an upcoming<br/>\nlong<br/>\ntrip she and I will be taking, but we haven&#39;t been able to let  go of the<br/>\nhighway safety advisories saying that kids under 13 should  ALWAYS ride in<br/>\nback,<br/>\nand we worry that we may be doing something  stupid. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Jayn tried to sit in the front seat now she wouldn&#39;t be able to see out <br/>\nthe window, and the seat belt wouldn&#39;t fit properly and safely. Those are <br/>\nthe criteria that I will use rather than her age. As someone who also lives <br/>\nin vehicle dense Southern California, and having been personally lucky not <br/>\nbe killed in two serious car accidents, neither of which were my fault or <br/>\nremotely predictable, I doubt I will be letting Jayn sit in the front seat <br/>\nuntil she fits the belt and the chair. Just like she will<br/>\nstay in her booster seat until she is around 4ft 9inches and the seat belt <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t visibly cut across her neck without the boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are just too many drunken maniacs on the road in this region (many of <br/>\nthem idiot celebrities apparently) to do anything to increase the risk of <br/>\ninjury. Out in the country on a little used road, it might feel safer.<br/>\nI like the CDC website for actual fatality and injury statistics.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/childpas.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/childpas.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we are going on long road trips, I tend to sit in the back with Jayn a <br/>\nlot while dh drives - even though I do get a bit car sick. Chewing gum helps <br/>\na lot with feeling queasy. Also we have a portable dvd player which she <br/>\nlikes, and we bring along her nintendo ds and drawing materials. We minimize <br/>\nthe time driving and stop often to look at sights.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L. Coburn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m having trouble weeding through the available information.  It  seems<br/>\nthat<br/>\nmost incidences of passenger airbag fatalities are caused by  unbelted kids<br/>\nor little ones in car seats.  And that if you move the seat  all the way<br/>\nback<br/>\nthe danger is greatly reduced if not prevented.  Then  again, we live in<br/>\nSouthern California where we have lots of traffic and  accidents and<br/>\ncareless<br/>\ndrivers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found this particularly interesting:<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral Factors<br/>\nIs there something magical about age 13 that  automatically makes children<br/>\nfit to sit up front? Are they big enough at that  age to withstand the<br/>\nairbag<br/>\nforces or grown up enough to behave up front?<br/>\nIt&#39;s a little of both, actually. NHTSA officials said the agency  basically<br/>\nselected age 12 for the cutoff after reviewing crash statistics that  showed<br/>\nproblems with frontal airbags seemed to decline as children get older.<br/>\nMaturity Weighs In<br/>\nBehavior is part of the problem. “Kids play  with the radio,” move around<br/>\nand tend not to be in proper position when an  airbag deploys in a crash,<br/>\nNHTSA<br/>\nspokeswoman Liz Neblett said.<br/>\nProximity to the frontal airbag is a big issue in airbag-caused injuries<br/>\nand<br/>\ndeaths; so is being properly positioned in the seat.<br/>\n“Theoretically, we didn&#39;t know how successful you can be . . . in  teaching<br/>\na<br/>\nchild never to lean forward” in the front seat, said a NHTSA  researcher who<br/>\nasked not to be named, explaining why the agency felt obligated  to list an<br/>\nage.<br/>\nDon&#39;t discount behavior out of hand. Some kids can&#39;t seem to sit still  for<br/>\nlonger than 30 seconds at a time. Indeed, one longtime child safety advocate<br/>\nsaid the NHTSA recommendation, while somewhat arbitrary in its age<br/>\nselection,<br/>\nhelped the agency send a simple, important message to parents.<br/>\nSize Matters, Too<br/>\nThe NHTSA researcher also said the agency  recognizes that “somewhere in<br/>\nthat<br/>\narea” of 11 and 12 years of age, “you have  bigger children” who are more<br/>\nakin to adults in size.<br/>\nNancy Delaney, chairperson of the Metro Detroit Safe Kids Coalition, said<br/>\nphysical stature matters because it&#39;s difficult for children to keep their<br/>\ndistance from that front airbag and keep their back against the seatback if<br/>\ntheir<br/>\nfeet don&#39;t touch the floor. “They tend to scrunch down” in the seat so<br/>\ntheir feet touch the floor and then they&#39;re out of position for the<br/>\ndeployment  of<br/>\nthe frontal airbag, she said.<br/>\nOn the other hand, she noted that there also could be a problem with<br/>\nchildren who pass age 12 and still are rather small. Parents think they can<br/>\nautomatically ride up front, but perhaps they should reconsider. “You get<br/>\nthese  kids<br/>\nwho are two-thirds leg [in body size] and they&#39;re willowy,” she said. “I&#39;m<br/>\nreally tempted to keep them in a car seat” in the back seat, where they<br/>\nwould<br/>\nbe  safest.<br/>\nA Simple Truth That Saves Lives<br/>\nAn often-overlooked fact, NHTSA  advises that all people, including adults,<br/>\nare safest in the back seat,  regardless of size or behavior.<br/>\n--- <br/>\nSo what do you all think?  Am I making too big of a deal out of  it?  Or not<br/>\nenough?  Most of our friends are super safety-conscious  and I&#39;m sure that<br/>\naffects our thinking.  Nowadays everything&#39;s  the parents&#39; fault, so part of<br/>\nus<br/>\nfears that guilt and blame from ourselves  and others would make an<br/>\nunthinkable<br/>\ntragedy that much more  tragic. But on the other hand it&#39;d be cool to have<br/>\nmy<br/>\ndaughter up  front sitting next to me, especially when it&#39;s just us in the<br/>\ncar.<br/>\nPatty<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

I did all that same <br/>\nresearch, and then Liam and I discussed it.  I told him all about the <br/>\nresearch and the statistics and that injuries occur when folks-big <br/>\nand small-are too close to the bag if it deploys.  So, armed with all <br/>\nthat information, it was *his* choice.  I told him if he wanted to <br/>\ncontinue riding in the front seat (something we both wanted), we&#39;d <br/>\njust need to be sure that his seat was as far back as possible and <br/>\nthat he stayed in the belt (something he&#39;s too smart not to do; he&#39;d <br/>\n*never* ride in the car without wanting the belt on).  He agreed that <br/>\nit would be better to minimize bending forward, but not to be crazy <br/>\nor racked with fear about it.  I do my part by being a very safe <br/>\ndriver, and I *know* we&#39;ll be all right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is after all that, when he got into the front seat of <br/>\nour new car for the first time, the airbag light for the passenger <br/>\nside indicated that the bag was &quot;off&quot; and would not deploy because, <br/>\nsaid the manual, there was a seat sensor that determined Liam not to <br/>\nweigh enough.  Cool!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s still really careful, though, and I still am a safe driver.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n~Marji, who had an easy time letting go of *that* fear!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] riding up front","postDate":"1183163319","msgId":29669,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENDRkM4NjgyLUVBMkMtNDM1OC1BQ0NCLTIwMkUxOUZCQjg2MUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGMxZS4xODA2NzE1Ni4zM2I2ZmQ4NkBhb2wuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGMxZS4xODA2NzE1Ni4zM2I2ZmQ4NkBhb2wuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":29668,"nextInTopic":29673,"prevInTime":29668,"nextInTime":29670,"topicId":29668,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Nancy Delaney, chairperson of the Metro Detroit Safe Kids Coalition, said physical stature matters because it s difficult for children to keep their ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-72034826\">-=-Nancy Delaney, chairperson of the Metro Detroit Safe Kids  <br/>\nCoalition, said<br/>\nphysical stature matters because it&#39;s difficult for children to keep  <br/>\ntheir<br/>\ndistance from that front airbag and keep their back against the  <br/>\nseatback if their<br/>\nfeet don&#39;t touch the floor.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nJust yesterday,  I met a woman who&#39;s probably in her late thirties  <br/>\nwho&#39;s only about 4&#39;9&quot;.<br/>\nShe should not sit in the front seat?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about hyperactive people who fidget and want to lean over and  <br/>\nget things out of the backpack or serve drinks all around, or play  <br/>\nwith the radio?

She  really wants to ride up","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-283894264\">My husband and I are trying to decide whether or not to let our 10 yo  <br/>\ndaughter ride in the front seat of the car (with airbag.)  She  really wants to ride <br/>\nup there, and I&#39;m inclined to say it&#39;s fine, especially for  an upcoming long <br/>\ntrip she and I will be taking, but we haven&#39;t been able to let  go of the <br/>\nhighway safety advisories saying that kids under 13 should  ALWAYS ride in back, <br/>\nand we worry that we may be doing something  stupid.<br/>\n <br/>\nI&#39;m having trouble weeding through the available information.  It  seems that <br/>\nmost incidences of passenger airbag fatalities are caused by  unbelted kids <br/>\nor little ones in car seats.  And that if you move the seat  all the way back <br/>\nthe danger is greatly reduced if not prevented.  Then  again, we live in <br/>\nSouthern California where we have lots of traffic and  accidents and careless <br/>\ndrivers.<br/>\n <br/>\nI found this particularly interesting:<br/>\n <br/>\nSeveral Factors<br/>\nIs there something magical about age 13 that  automatically makes children <br/>\nfit to sit up front? Are they big enough at that  age to withstand the airbag <br/>\nforces or grown up enough to behave up front?  <br/>\nIt&#39;s a little of both, actually. NHTSA officials said the agency  basically <br/>\nselected age 12 for the cutoff after reviewing crash statistics that  showed <br/>\nproblems with frontal airbags seemed to decline as children get older.  <br/>\nMaturity Weighs In<br/>\nBehavior is part of the problem. “Kids play  with the radio,” move around <br/>\nand tend not to be in proper position when an  airbag deploys in a crash, NHTSA <br/>\nspokeswoman Liz Neblett said.  <br/>\nProximity to the frontal airbag is a big issue in airbag-caused injuries  and <br/>\ndeaths; so is being properly positioned in the seat.  <br/>\n“Theoretically, we didn&#39;t know how successful you can be . . . in  teaching a <br/>\nchild never to lean forward” in the front seat, said a NHTSA  researcher who <br/>\nasked not to be named, explaining why the agency felt obligated  to list an <br/>\nage.  <br/>\nDon&#39;t discount behavior out of hand. Some kids can&#39;t seem to sit still  for <br/>\nlonger than 30 seconds at a time. Indeed, one longtime child safety advocate  <br/>\nsaid the NHTSA recommendation, while somewhat arbitrary in its age selection,  <br/>\nhelped the agency send a simple, important message to parents.  <br/>\nSize Matters, Too<br/>\nThe NHTSA researcher also said the agency  recognizes that “somewhere in that <br/>\narea” of 11 and 12 years of age, “you have  bigger children” who are more <br/>\nakin to adults in size.  <br/>\nNancy Delaney, chairperson of the Metro Detroit Safe Kids Coalition, said  <br/>\nphysical stature matters because it&#39;s difficult for children to keep their  <br/>\ndistance from that front airbag and keep their back against the seatback if  their <br/>\nfeet don&#39;t touch the floor. “They tend to scrunch down” in the seat so  <br/>\ntheir feet touch the floor and then they&#39;re out of position for the deployment  of <br/>\nthe frontal airbag, she said.  <br/>\nOn the other hand, she noted that there also could be a problem with  <br/>\nchildren who pass age 12 and still are rather small. Parents think they can  <br/>\nautomatically ride up front, but perhaps they should reconsider. “You get these  kids <br/>\nwho are two-thirds leg [in body size] and they&#39;re willowy,” she said. “I&#39;m  <br/>\nreally tempted to keep them in a car seat” in the back seat, where they would <br/>\nbe  safest.  <br/>\nA Simple Truth That Saves Lives<br/>\nAn often-overlooked fact, NHTSA  advises that all people, including adults, <br/>\nare safest in the back seat,  regardless of size or behavior. <br/>\n--- <br/>\nSo what do you all think?  Am I making too big of a deal out of  it?  Or not <br/>\nenough?  Most of our friends are super safety-conscious  and I&#39;m sure that <br/>\naffects our thinking.  Nowadays everything&#39;s  the parents&#39; fault, so part of us <br/>\nfears that guilt and blame from ourselves  and others would make an unthinkable <br/>\ntragedy that much more  tragic. But on the other hand it&#39;d be cool to have my <br/>\ndaughter up  front sitting next to me, especially when it&#39;s just us in the  <br/>\ncar.<br/>\nPatty<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":29721,"nextTopicId":29728}}
