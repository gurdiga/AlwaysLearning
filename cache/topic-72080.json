She may have many reasons. The reasons may be all tangled up inside of her.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep open to her ideas. Keep trying different things. Everything you offer, even if it doesn&#39;t help, gives her a better understanding of herself and her world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; what I say it does not need school for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Your answer says to her that school *could* help her learn  to read and write. But that for some mysterious reason you want her to learn to read  on her own.<br/>\n<br/>\nA more truthful answer is that all kids learn to read when their brains are ready to read. Just as your younger daughter is learning to talk and learned to walk when she was ready. There wasn&#39;t anything you could have done that would speed learning those up. The tricky thing about learning to read, though, is that most kids naturally learn to read between 6 and 8. That&#39;s also when schools do reading lessons. So the schools think they&#39;re teaching kids to read. But the kids are learning on their own. Though sometimes kids get annoyed or discouraged by the lessons that try to make them do things they aren&#39;t ready for and decide they don&#39;t like to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s okay if your daughter doesn&#39;t believe you! Questioning what we hear is a good thing! It&#39;s okay if she wants to try school to decide for herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In fact I feel she wants a &quot;normal&quot; life be like any other children.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe. If you just moved, it is very likely she&#39;s trying to fit in. Humans are social creatures. We want to be part of society. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; even if I think it [school] does not suit her .<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t know. She can&#39;t know. If humans could know what&#39;s right for them by being told, then school would be a great place to learn!<br/>\n<br/>\n*She* will know school doesn&#39;t suit her by trying it. At school she will find parts she likes and parts she doesn&#39;t like. She will get to know herself better. She will experience something you can&#39;t give her.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling parents have a big advantage over unschooled children: Unschooling parents have been to school. They&#39;ve experienced the good and bad of school. They&#39;ve also experienced the good and bad of unschooling. They can speak from experience when they say an unschooling home is a better place to learn than a school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooled children don&#39;t have that experience. They know what we say. They know what schooled kids say. But it&#39;s not the same as experience. Not all unschooled kids want to go to school. It doesn&#39;t sound appealing to them. But some do. Think of school as an interest. :-) What would you do to support her interest?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could find substitutes, as you&#39;ve been trying. You could ask her what she imagines a day at school would be like. What does she think would be fun? What does she think would be not fun?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter thought kindergarten would be riding big tricycles like in preschool. So she was okay with not going when she found out there were no tricycles in kindergarten.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe did try grade 2. After 2 months she decided she was done. She learned loads about school while she was there. She learn why school wasn&#39;t great place for her to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you fear will happen if she goes to school?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoyce<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] support when things are going too fast and position on school","postDate":"1378043680","msgId":72082,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDg0MUQ1Q0I4LUVGMDUtNDFCMy05MjI3LTc1MjI4RkZBNTEwREBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGt2dmU0dCsxM3YybDVhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGt2dmU0dCsxM3YybDVhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72080,"nextInTopic":72084,"prevInTime":72081,"nextInTime":72083,"topicId":72080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-This is even more complicated for me it is something difficult for me, focus me, do not scatter me and suddenly it  electrifies  the one and the other .","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-131516932\">-=-This is even more complicated for me it is something difficult for me, focus me, do not scatter me and suddenly it &quot; electrifies &quot; the one and the other .

You&#39;re the third person from Mexico who&#39;s ever mentioned unschooling, and that&#39;s since July of this year.  One was an au pair, and not a mom, who came to the LiTTLe Conference near London this summer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn The Netherlands, it&#39;s a problem for a child to be enrolled and then taken out of school.  By &quot;problem&quot; I mean, can&#39;t be done (as the laws are right now).  I know zip about Mexican law and compulsory education (if any), so I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s state-to-state or a federal law.  As you&#39;re French, it might not apply to you entirely anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWikipedia (which might or might not be correct) says federal, compulsory, but:  &quot;Proof of Mexican citizenship is required to attend public schools for free.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf language comes easy to you and if that trait is in your daughter, she might pick up a lot of Spanish from TV.  I have friends who were unschooling in the U.S and moved to England, where they continued unschooling, but when they moved to France they put their kids in school so they would read and write French, and use the language easily.  That part of the plan seems to be working. One of the children likes school better than the other, but theyr&#39;e going, and now they know more kids in their little town, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI met kids in India who were tri-lingual without going to school�English from parents, Marathi from relatives and neighbors and hearing parents speak with servants, and Hindi from kids&#39; TV shows and from videos.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":466721704,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;adamoiseau77@...&gt;","profile":"adamoiseau77","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"support when things are going too fast and position on school","postDate":"1378040797","msgId":72080,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGt2dmU0dCsxM3YybDVhQFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72082,"prevInTime":72079,"nextInTime":72081,"topicId":72080,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hello everyone , I read you for some time now and I need your lights because I was struggling to position myself with the demands/needs of my first daughter","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1122787841\">Hello everyone , I read you for some time now and I need your lights because I was struggling to position myself with the demands/needs of my first daughter Naïa ( 5 years).
