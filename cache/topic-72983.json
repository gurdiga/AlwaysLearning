Nobody can have everything they want whenever they want it.  Most people learn to adapt to that reality.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that when arbitrary limits are imposed, problems arise.  That&#39;s not because a person does not have the ability to accept reality.  It&#39;s because reality has been purposefully distorted for the benefit of one person over another.  And, when that person, who is at the mercy of those arbitrary rules challenges those limits, we call them names like greedy, impulsive, never satisfied, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was first beginning to learn about unschooling, I didn&#39;t talk with family or casual friends about what we were doing.  With most people, I kept my dialogue surrounding our homeschooling vague and positive.  That helped to keep questions to a minimum until I had enough understanding and accumulated evidence to be able to talk about our lives with conviction and proof of concept.    <br/>\n<br/>\nFor now, read Pam Larrichia&#39;s book, as Sandra suggested (it&#39;s excellent), and really watch your children learn - learn about everything.  The more you understand their learning, the more you will understand the nature of learning.  Consequently, the easier it will become to answer other people&#39;s questions, or dodge them as you see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] delayed gratification","postDate":"1387731397","msgId":72984,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI1MzU2RjYxLTMyRjYtNERCMC04Q0Y0LTcxMTE0Q0Y2N0U3NEBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PENBSl82TUhweUxGUURPSnhqV21iQ0M9T0MyNk4yK0N3S193cGpMWFB6Ni16clhKLU5Qd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PENBSl82TUhweUxGUURPSnhqV21iQ0M9T0MyNk4yK0N3S193cGpMWFB6Ni16clhKLU5Qd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":72983,"nextInTopic":72985,"prevInTime":72983,"nextInTime":72985,"topicId":72983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-This question doesn t come from me, but from a relative who is concerned our children will grow up expecting to get everything they want as soon as they","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-496244564\"><html><head></head>-=-<span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">This question doesn&#39;t come from me, but from a relative who is concerned our children will grow up expecting to get everything they want as soon as they want it.-=-</span><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The purpose of this group isn&#39;t to be a source of answers for everyone&#39;s relatives. &nbsp;As you learn more about unschooling, you&#39;ll be able to provide answers from your own experience. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\">One good thing to do for relatives would be to ask them to read about unschooling. &nbsp;Probably the best thing is Pam Laricchia&#39;s book &quot;Free to Learn.&quot; If you haven&#39;t read it yourself yet, that would be a good thing, too. &nbsp;It&#39;s very inexpensive in paper or ebook, and available in the UK, too.</span></div><div><span style=\"font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><br></span></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Learn-Ideas-Joyful-Unschooling/dp/098773332X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387731215&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pam+laricchia\">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Free-Learn-Ideas-Joyful-Unschooling/dp/098773332X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387731215&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pam+laricchia</a></div><div><br></div><div>Links that might help you with the particular question of delayed gratification will require some reading. &nbsp;They&#39;re not going to be &quot;yes it does,&quot; or &quot;no, it never does.&quot; &nbsp;Nothing is that simple. &nbsp;There are principles to understand so that the parent can beging to make decisions in new ways for new reasons.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Some people seem to hope that &quot;becoming an unschooler&quot; is like joining a church, professing faith, being baptized, and after that things are just different. &nbsp;No, it&#39;s a build-a-different-life situation that takes many years.</div><div><br></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/spoiled\">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a></div><div><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/finishwhatyoustart\">http://sandradodd.com/finishwhatyoustart</a></div><div><br></div><div>Those have links to other pages, too.</div><div><br></div><div>Sandra</div></html></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":279436458,"authorName":"kirkpatrick clare","from":"kirkpatrick clare &lt;clare.kirkpatrick@...&gt;","profile":"clarekirkp","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"delayed gratification","postDate":"1387730149","msgId":72983,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBSl82TUhweUxGUURPSnhqV21iQ0M9T0MyNk4yK0N3S193cGpMWFB6Ni16clhKLU5Qd0BtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":72984,"prevInTime":72982,"nextInTime":72984,"topicId":72983,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Does unschooling mean that children won t learn how to accept delayed gratification?
