Yet, it is something I do think about regularly, partly out of my own apprehension of what is to come.  I was not an easy teen, and I made a lot of really poor choices.  I know now that was partly because I was reacting to all of the controls and unreliable adults in my life, but I would still find it very helpful to read about the lives of unschooled teens so that I can see a different outcome to my own.
