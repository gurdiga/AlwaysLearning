So wonderfully the life to live. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimon turned 12 a couple of weeks ago. As I snuggled my newly 12 year old son and talked in awe of having this boy who I used to carry in one arm, who was so fragile and so tiny and still clearly such a life changing force become this 12 year old guy who I can talk to and listen to and hang out with and do stuff with and laugh with and who is this amazing part of my life, he asked if the time has flown by. It hasn&#39;t. One of the amazing things to me about unschooling is that I get all these precious moments all the time. I get to be there all the time. It doesn&#39;t fly by. And I said that, I said it has gone fabulously slowly. I said the past 12 years only feels like it&#39;s whizzed by when I look back on them, but in the moment, it is every moment. But maybe, I said, I haven&#39;t savored them as much as I&#39;d like. Maybe there is more to being in the moment with him than I&#39;ve done up to this point. So that&#39;s my birthday resolution. <br/>\n<br/>\nI love your life well savored.

We were both in tears, from frustration and  <br/>\nfear.  And I said to myself, NEVER AGAIN!  Nothing is worth what we  <br/>\nwent through that day.  I had ignored Luke (3 years old then) for  <br/>\nthose three hours, unconscionable to me today.  So many thoughts sped  <br/>\nthrough my head when I made that declaration, one of which was that I  <br/>\nwas prepared to go to the mat with Steve on this issue.  It&#39;s  <br/>\nsometimes been rocky with him; he likes convention,  and the  <br/>\ntraditional; unschooling still freaks him out for a moment or two.   <br/>\nBut I&#39;ve become better at calming his fears, from learning about  <br/>\nnatural learning, and deeply paying attention to my kids, and  <br/>\nexpressing (and arguing) that to/with him. But he gets it that all  <br/>\nthe spoken and unspoken promises of school and schooling don&#39;t come  <br/>\nto pass.  It&#39;s a carrot on a stick; you can never get it, you always  <br/>\nhave to think ahead, you can&#39;t relax in the moment, you have to push,  <br/>\nyou barely get to breathe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had come across unschooling about a year before that ugly saxon  <br/>\nmath day, but it freaked Steve out and he wanted to see more regular  <br/>\nschool, so I tried it for 9 months.  I&#39;m embarrassed to say that all  <br/>\nthe rage that year in our homeschooling group was the well-trained  <br/>\nmind, which is what I subjected Addi to (not as strict as the program  <br/>\nlays out, but still...).  Ugh.  Hmmm, interesting enough I&#39;ve been  <br/>\ncleaning out lots of nooks and crannies lately and I came across the  <br/>\nhuge binders that you are supposed to use for that program in which  <br/>\nto keep all the paperwork (read: shit) your poor kid generates, and  <br/>\none of the saxon math workbooks; that all got taken away in the  <br/>\ngarbage today.  I thought about giving the workbook away to a local  <br/>\nhomeschooler, but I didn&#39;t want any part of that pain inflicted on  <br/>\nanother kid.  I also found some of Addi&#39;s papers from that time; they  <br/>\nare lifeless.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut enough about schoolish crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeven years ago also marks when I committed to learning about  <br/>\nunschooling, reading at a message board and then finding email lists,  <br/>\nand Sandra&#39;s site and later Joyce&#39;s site.<br/>\n<br/>\nAddi only went to preschool, kindergarden, and 10 days of first  <br/>\ngrade, but the damage was done.  Deschooling seemed way longer than  <br/>\nthe, one month for every year your kid was in school; it seems 8  <br/>\nmonths ago I was helping Addi through an angsty time of, &#39;the kids  <br/>\nfrom school know more factoids than me&#39;, and that they connect with  <br/>\neach other over school drivel, and she was feeling like an outsider.   <br/>\nLuke who&#39;s never been to school has none of this, and he has an  <br/>\nunmistakable confidence in life.  I think part, if not most of that  <br/>\nis their personalities, but schooling damaged Addi&#39;s confidence, and  <br/>\nunschooling has enhanced both their confidences.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now Addi is chatting with and counseling her friend, who has a  <br/>\npropensity for drama & trouble with friends and family.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke has just been describing to me some armor he is designing.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Luke went to the dentist to have a couple cavities filled, he  <br/>\ngot really woozie and worn out from the anesthetic.  He missed kung  <br/>\nfu, because he was still feeling wiped, but he had plans to talk to  <br/>\nthe Sei Fu (sp?) about a problematic kid who disrupts the class a  <br/>\nlot, and we&#39;ll do that next Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all snuggled on my bed with the dogs and read _The Sea of  <br/>\nMonsters_.  I&#39;m reading it to Luke, Addi read it a long time ago, but  <br/>\nshe wanted to come listen.  We laughed our butts off at the funny  <br/>\nparts.  I&#39;ve become a really good oral reader, paying attention to  <br/>\nthe words ahead so that I can use the correct voice to the correct  <br/>\ncharacter.  Luke and Addi both read and love reading, and still love  <br/>\nme to read to them.  It&#39;s quite an interactive event, because we  <br/>\nfancy discussing the choices of the character and the words of the  <br/>\nauthor and the events and plots and all of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke played with friends on World of Warcraft & Warcraft 3, continued  <br/>\ntheir epic, highly detailed role-plays, negotiated frustrations with  <br/>\neach other.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth my kids said, &quot;I love you.&quot; to me about 5 times today.<br/>\n<br/>\nAddi negotiated with a woman buying all her old tack from her horse  <br/>\nriding days; we looked at pictures of puppies that she gets to take  <br/>\ncare of when we go to CA in a couple weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe listened to music, did some trouble shooting on the computer,  <br/>\ncooked, played draw-a-letter-on-your-back-and-guess-it,  looked at  <br/>\nsome pictures of historical Fort Collins and learned that a prominent  <br/>\nwhite man (Antoine Janis) married an Oglala woman named, First Elk  <br/>\nWoman, the Oglala called Antione &quot;Yellow Hair All Messed Up&quot;, he went  <br/>\nto the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation with her when her people were  <br/>\nforced to move there rather than stay here without her; we made rice  <br/>\ncrispy treats, danced, watched funny cat youtube videos,...<br/>\n<br/>\nWe discussed racism, human behavior, books, music, lyrics,  <br/>\nclassification of plants, illnesses, dog behavior, past fun we&#39;ve had  <br/>\nwith dogs, life after death, CA fun places, getting shots (in  <br/>\ndetail!),...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis week I made beignets for my family, Addi helped me chop down a  <br/>\ntree in the backyard (omg, she cracked me up with her tree limb  <br/>\nwrestling techniques,  I almost peed my pants.), we delivered Meals  <br/>\non Wheels (on our travels we saw a very tall, skinny guy with black  <br/>\nhair (style: mullet!), and black garb with metal rings and chains and  <br/>\nsuch, walking an impeccably groomed bright white pomeranian - awesome  <br/>\nsight);  I got a compliment about Addi from a neighbor who thinks  <br/>\nshe&#39;s blooming into such a wonderful young woman.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often thank Addi for one of her qualities - persistence, and her  <br/>\nresistance to my attempted teaching of her when she 7 years old, for  <br/>\nthat paved the way to unschooling for us.  she always says, &quot;ah mom,  <br/>\nit&#39;s ok.&quot;  She&#39;s so generous it makes me cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m SO thankful to the people (namely, Deb L, Pam S, Sandra,  <br/>\nSchuyler, Joyce, Kelly L,) who continue to write and document about  <br/>\nunschooling on the international lists.
