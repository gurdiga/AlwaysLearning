The swimming hole is like heaven to us, to find something natural and beautiful and so BIG is just fun for all of us, especially the kids whose parents aren&#39;t necessarily expanding their worlds the way our family tries to do.  To me it was an unschooling question because of the contrast between the freedom to explore that I want to give my own kids as opposed to the trust I may not be able to share with the other kids. I suppose it&#39;s more of an &quot;attentive parenting&quot; parenting question than an unschooling question.

My oldest is 9 and my youngest is 2. We live in a poor neighborhood where everything is crowded and ugly and most of our friends are children whose parents don&#39;t have time or motivation to be with them. So they end up in our yard for most of the summer. <br/>\n<br/>\nA friend of mine and I recently decided to walk to a swimming hole where many of the neighborhood kids go when they tell their parents they are at a friend&#39;s house. It&#39;s wonderful. It&#39;s a mile walk, and the walk is a little less than safe because of narrow roads and no sidewalks in some places. But it was worth it. The swimming hole is a wide river and it&#39;s beautiful. The water is a little fast and the depths vary. The last time we went, two neighborhood children came along with us. They asked permission from their mothers, who asked them to behave themselves and stay close to us. We had a total of eight children with two adults.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question is this: how would a well-developed unschooling family handle safety in this situation? There are parts of the river that are more dangerous than others. I don&#39;t want to be yelling at them to stay here, don&#39;t go so far. I love that they are exploring. But at the same time, I have responsibility for two kids that aren&#39;t my own. My four year old stays naturally near me and my two year old stays in a stroller that I move into the water so he can kick his toes in. Since I have the little ones, going out to the deeper parts wouldn&#39;t really be easy or helpful - the stroller doesn&#39;t go and if I had him in my arms, I couldn&#39;t help someone who went under. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far it&#39;s been great and there have been no problems, but as I am growing in my understanding of myself and my children and trying to allow what I believe and what I do to be the same, I wanted to see if anyone had any advice. Thank you.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":68269,"nextTopicId":68261}}
