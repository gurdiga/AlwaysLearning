It seems to me that, like my younger sisters who decided that<br/>\n&quot;earning the right to have a social life&quot; is the way to get one, their<br/>\ndaughter looked on the older sibling&#39;s experience as a yardstick for what<br/>\n*not* to do and went in that direction as far as she could go.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo both those kids are doing without the knowledge that their parents<br/>\nsupport their own efforts to educate themselves and they&#39;re having the word<br/>\n&quot;unschooling&quot; falsely slapped onto it into the bargain.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo some extent they&#39;re both experiencing having failed to meet their<br/>\nparent&#39;s expectations, and having not done unschooling right.  Unschooling<br/>\nis the parent&#39;s goal and responsibility though, not the kids&#39;.  It&#39;s up to<br/>\nparents to learn how to do it and make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they&#39;ve ended up with is not unschooling.  That&#39;s authoritative<br/>\nparenting.
