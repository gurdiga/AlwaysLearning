But attendance crept down (all those<br/>\nschool-at-homers get wrapped up in their need to do academic work) and<br/>\nthey began to invite school groups.

A friend has recently approached me<br/>\nwith the fact that she is burnt out on structured school-at-home, and<br/>\ntrying to open her mind to another approach.

WE started out calling it that because the kids wouldn&#39;t come<br/>\nthere  to <br/>\nstudy.  We found a local boys and girls club, they have after school<br/>\nprograms <br/>\nfor school kids but the facility wasn&#39;t used during the day.  They  had<br/>\na gym <br/>\nand gym type equipment, pool tables, computers, fooz ball table, table<br/>\nhockey, <br/>\ngames, tables and chairs, bumper pool.  We hammered out  arrangements<br/>\nfor <br/>\nprice per child and basically we had the gym to ourselves with  the<br/>\nagreement that <br/>\nwe would be out in time for their after school program and we  would<br/>\nclean up <br/>\nafter ourselves.  <br/>\n <br/>\nIt worked out great.  WE opened it up to all homeschool kids and found<br/>\nthat <br/>\nunschoolers were the only ones with a free enough schedule to come.<br/>\nLOL it <br/>\nstarted off slow but by the end of the year we had 30 kids coming.   The<br/>\nthing <br/>\nthat was better than a park day was that we came even if it was<br/>\nraining, and <br/>\neven older kids enjoyed.  It was so nice to see all ages  playing<br/>\ntogether.  <br/>\nThe kids would go from one game to another as they  liked.  We had no <br/>\npreplanned games or activities it was up to the kids what  they did.<br/>\nSome kids would <br/>\ndraw while others would just shoot the basket  ball around.  Then more<br/>\nwould <br/>\njoin in on the basketball and some would go  play something else.  Very<br/>\nfree and <br/>\nnice.  I drove about 25 minutes  but we had some that would drive about<br/>\n1 1/2 <br/>\nhours to come.  <br/>\n <br/>\nJust another thought,<br/>\nPam G</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20582,"nextTopicId":20588}}
