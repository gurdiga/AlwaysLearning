I did read the Explosive Child and it helped alot. Seeing explosions as what they are and finding out the triggers prior to the explosions has been the most insightful. My daughter&#39;s friends tend to put my guy over, so we make sure he has something interesting going on. Outdoors helps alot. Not reacting to his actions, except to make sure he and everyone are safe until it passes. Teaching and modeling breathing. He has mastered this now and I can hold him and say breath and he does and the energy melts. He still needs a hold until it passes, and often he gets mad at first when I hold him. I say I love you Riley and I want to help you, please breath so we can talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for foods, protein for my guy is a must. I also have no limits on foods here either, and I tend to offer protein 4 or more times a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nRiley needs activity, physical and mental to be balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe found diving to be a passion for Riley and he has had few meltdowns this summer. He dives in the am, swims for a rec. swim team, dives again with all the buddies he has made all afternoon. He is becoming the beautiful person that he will be and I can see him beyond the foul experiences we have had. He is now 7.5 and 1.5 years ago I was pulling at my hair thinking this kid is going to destroy us. Today he is still intense, a bit more mature, and able to walk away from hitting easier. He has 2 intense sisters which tend to be his triggers and we work mainly on coming to me with the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this gives you some hope, I can&#39;t believe that I am able to say the explosions are going away. Everyone here said hang on, it&#39;s tough, keep loving and respecting and connecting.<br/>\n<br/>\nMary Hickman</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":20277,"nextTopicId":20323}}
