Ward.  I got it from Chinaberry several years back.  <br/>\nI&#39;m not certain if they still carry it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe back cover describes the book this way: &quot;Worshipers tread many different <br/>\npaths in their search for peace, love, and eternal happiness.  This book <br/>\nwill tell you about the more familiar paths or faiths, and about some of the <br/>\nlesser-know faiths, too... Hiley Ward takes us across the U.S. to visit <br/>\nvarious worshiping groups.  At each stop we meet a young person who shares <br/>\nwith us the special ceremony that marks one&#39;s coming-of-age in his or her <br/>\nown faith.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is not exhaustive in any respect, but a good jumping off point.  <br/>\nThe appendix lists addresses of the religions and groups discussed in the <br/>\nbook.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Stacey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n_________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\">http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":81,"nextTopicId":167}}
