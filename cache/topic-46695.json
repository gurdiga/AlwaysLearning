People have been burned by sticking their hands into the water.  More than just a few freak cases.  Some pools are cool; others are near boiling.  there is a great deal of geothermal shifting that makes the water features very unpredictable, as well as brilliantly colored...and if a child bends to look or touch, their heavier head can easily put them off-balance.  just stepping off the boardwalks can be deadly, because the earth beside it is often not nearly so firm as it seems, and boiling water could lie just beneath.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour mother is fortunate, and I am glad she wasn&#39;t harmed.  She aseasily could have been, had the feature been hotter.  There really isn&#39;t any way for a visitor to know (but, seriously, when the water is steaming, that should be a clue.  Most of us wouldn&#39;t stick our hands in a steaming kettle on the stove!)<br/>\n<br/>\nA park employee and experienced hiker died during the time we worked there, and her friends were severely burned.

You&#39;re right!  Not allowing isn&#39;t the answer.  Awareness is.  Parents who bring children to the edge of canyons would do very well to consider potentially life-threatening conditions ahead of time, and to prepare their children for them.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if that happened in this case, and I haven&#39;t yet had a boy the age of the boy in the original post. But humans are equipped with a survival instinct, and knowing the full -ahem- gravity of the situation might have easily led to a child who chose a tree a few feet further from the edge to challenge himself with, and a mother who didn&#39;t need to walk away in terror.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was reacting, in part, to my own near miss at falling into the canyon, during a picnic lunch with Jim in the first days of our relationship.  I&#39;d stretched prone on a warm ,spacious rock along the rim, and, when I rolled to get up, I rolled toward the edge (my sense of direction is unreliable).  I felt the emptiness beside me in time, and caught myself.  But it is likely I would have died, if I hadn&#39;t.  It was quite a drop.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ~~I would be giving them the benefit of my experience where theirs might be lacking.  I&#39;d do it for any of you, too...because that is, after all, what friends are for.~~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Experience can only come from actual experience. You can share, but that doesn&#39;t equal their agreement with your take on the experience. Yes, parents should share information and discuss strategies for safety. In the end, you only gain experience directly...otherwise it&#39;s simply information that may or may not have any relevance for the other person.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>True.  We talk about the canyon, and Yellowstone, frequently, read about them, watch documentaries.  We do not gloss over the dangers in our extolling of their beauty.  We walk along busy two-lane mountain highways with narrow shoulders to trailheads leading past eroded gorges and boulder-strewn paths.  We&#39;ve played in and around waterfalls, canoed, and camped in the wilderness.  We&#39;ve crossed busy city streets.  We&#39;ve talked, throughout, about what is safe, scary, or outright dangerous. <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully, we&#39;re building awareness and the ability to judge their capabilities against the potential for risk.  They aren&#39;t quite there, yet, and that is why I stay nearby when they try new and possibly risky feats, to help them navigate - or, if absolutely necessary, to remove them from harm&#39;s way. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Ren, for pointing out the flaws in my &quot;don&#39;t allow&quot; stance.

If I&#39;ve missed something and they have a piece of info for me that changes my opinion, they feel free to share it and sometimes it does.  There&#39;s lots of give and take, and they trust that my opinions aren&#39;t arbitrary.  We don&#39;t have issues with &quot;won&#39;t allow&quot; anymore--we just live together and help each other out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there are beginning to be more times that my son (14) helps me out in a similar way.  We were given some irresistible fluffy cinnamon bread that we were sharing, and my son knew that if I kept eating I would get a stomach ache, so he gently reminded me.  When I kept indulging, he tried to take it away from me--which showed me exactly how kids feel when food is withheld or taken from them--not good.  So we talked about that, and then I did stop eating.

I let my son go in both areas. But technically I COULD get scolded for allowing my son to play in either area as he is under 2. Pfff! I personally would allow my kids to play on any equipment they want to and spot them while acting like I&#39;m not. ;o) I guess I&#39;d play dumb if I got in &quot;trouble&quot; by the resort or a cop or something. I also will allow my children to put rocks or woodchips, say, on the slides as long as there are no other kids or where there are kids (or parents) who don&#39;t mind them on there. I get annoyed when parents don&#39;t care for this sort of thing but I&#39;m learning to be respectful while living my rebel lifestyle. :O)<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of parents do not allow their babies or toddlers, even preschoolers, into the hot tubs here, either for fear of what so many doctors advise against it, I&#39;m sure...The sign posted says they (kids under 12) can go in as long as they are accomopanied by an adult (who has been &#39;cleared&#39; by their physician to go in such hot water...LOL).<br/>\n  <br/>\nIt makes me so sad to witness when the children so want to go in them! I went during pregnancy with my kids AND they still go now. In fact, my daughter finally began to go under water in the one hot tub here where she would not do it before. My kids love the warmth (as does mama!!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis brings to mind an incident that occurred when I was 4yo in Mexico while my parents & I were living there. There was a little pony ride shindig off the side of the road. I believe the road was a 4 lane highway (not a highway like ours but still, a major thruway). For some reason the man operating this didn&#39;t lead me around the little circle (which was NOT enclosed completely)by the rope or didn&#39;t have a good enough grip. My parents trusted me to ride this pony. I remember feeling so confident. Well my dog decided to jump out one of the windows on our VW bus & chase the pony. The pony ran onto the road in the opposition direction. I remember thinking OMG this pony is taking me away from my mom. I remember envisioning the pony running past house after house further and further away from her. I thought, &quot;I need to let go&quot;. So I did. I allowed my body to fall to the right & I landed on the asphalt which resulted in a very scratched up bloody right cheek and a fractured leg. The whole scene that followed was chaotic. My mom was hysterical. A lady cop with blue eyeshadow pulled us over wondering why my dad was speeding. My mom showed me to her and I think she escorted us to the hospital. Quite humorous. But all in all, I handled it just fine on my own & I think my parents trust in me on the pony was awesome...or maybe the guy WAS holding the rope and they thought I was safe...but still, I felt on top of the world thruout the whole experience. I even rode a bigger pony with my cast on. :O) What spirit. I still have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -=- My middle son, Martin, climbed monkey bars<br/>\n&gt; six feet off the ground at eleven months of age(with a mat  <br/>\n&gt; underneath).

If I &quot;give  <br/>\nmy children freedom&quot; in a situation, it&#39;s because I had some leeway or  <br/>\nrights myself.  I cannot &quot;give them freedom&quot; that I don&#39;t have.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome unschoolers become confused on that, and they begin to frolic in  <br/>\nthe &quot;freedom&quot; that they are pretty sure some stranger online granted  <br/>\nthem, and that unschoolers have inalienably from God, bypassing all  <br/>\nforms of government and the limitations of wallboard.  And so if an  <br/>\nunschooling family is up at 3:00 a.m. playing Guitar Hero, they seem  <br/>\nmystified that the neighbors have called the landlord.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m exaggerating.  I hope I&#39;m exaggerating.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a storeowner says not to touch the crystal figures, a parent cannot  <br/>\n&quot;give her child the freedom&quot; to touch them anyway.  She could buy one  <br/>\nand take it out of the store and let her kid touch the heck out of it,  <br/>\nbut she can&#39;t tell a store owner, &quot;You don&#39;t understand; we&#39;re  <br/>\nunschoolers.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although I might seem to be wandering aimlessly here, freedom  <br/>\nshould involve a respect for others, and a respect for logic.  And a  <br/>\nfamily might not feel they &quot;respect the law,&quot; but the laws still do  <br/>\napply to them, no matter how twinkly-eyed they have become in their  <br/>\nnewfound &quot;freedom.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if someone is selling you &quot;True Freedom&quot; (or snake oil, or the  <br/>\nelixir of the fountain of life), have respect for yourself and your  <br/>\nfamily and take a pass on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, parents with a realistic and considered awareness of what  <br/>\ntheir own freedoms are within the laws of the apartment building,  <br/>\nhousing development, city, county/parish/township, state/province or  <br/>\nnation are free to share some of those with their children.

Climbing is not about trust, but about probability and<br/>\nrisks.  As an adult I am responsible, and I have the life experience to know<br/>\nthat a two year old who uses sharp paring knives might get hurt, but under<br/>\nsupervision I can intervene.  The Grand Canyon drop wouldn&#39;t qualify as<br/>\nsomething I could offer first aid to fix and so I have to say this seems<br/>\nshortsighted on the part of the parent.

I am a newish unschooler who lived and worked for nine months at the Grand Canyon.  My husband lived and hiked extensively there for 12 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can state with certainty that there are definite dangers in walking away and trusting in a child&#39;s capability to hang on a tree growing horizontally at or near the canyon rim... <br/>\n<br/>\nThe rim is, in many places, heavy with slippery scree.  Trees may seem to be a lot more firmly anchored than they are.  In many places, rescue if a slip occurred would be very difficult, perhaps requiring a helicopter or another method that would then endanger other lives.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Grand Canyon is not permanent and unchanging.  The rim is constantly eroding, and earthquakes are not rare, there.  great boulders sometimes fall, without warning... <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are warning signs about these dangers, and rangers will warn or ticket people who violate the law regarding use of the canyon.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAside from the risk to the child, the tree, already growing in a difficult environment, could easily have been broken or harmed by the stunt...<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath can and is sometimes part of a national park experience, and often, it is just this type of unknowing carelessness that leads to it.  There were deaths with very similar circumstances at both the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone during the time we lived there.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is no protection at all from natural dangers.  Common sense and awareness of the environment&#39;s inherent risks are still needed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI would not allow even my very agile child to take the risk of hanging from a tree at the rim, nor would I allow my children to put their hands into a Yellowstone hot spring to test its heat...  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn these cases, the limits are clearly imposed by the environment, and I would be giving them the benefit of my experience where theirs might be lacking.

I really appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must admit I feel mighty nauseated (literally) even imagining one of my children out on a limb over the freakin&#39; Grand Canyon or some such scenario. I know it could happen & that this sort of thing happens all the time...especially with brave bold children. This is a wonderful trait to have. I would do my best to get the kid down ASAP also while remaining as cool calm & collected as I could in the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose you guys are right about our culture & how we view childhood exploration. I remember doing a LOT when by myself outside (& in)that most would consider negligent on a parent&#39;s part. I have asked my mother if she was behind me or nearby during _____________ & she doesn&#39;t remember, unfortunately. I DO know I was alone after the age of about 6 or 7 in the house. I also walked to & fro friends houses & to schools in big cities (Baltimore, Manhattan) in early elementary school & intermediate. When I was a kid I did not wear a helmet when I rode my big wheel (which I loved to do donuts in on the street & while pulling the E-brake) or while ice or roller skating. In fact, I even used to walk across the lake (when it was frozen, that is) I lived on during my high school years...it was 9 miles long & a mile wide. I did this at night at least once that I can remember. I rode in cars without seat belts as a young one. etc. etc. etc. & I am alive. Maybe when its our &#39;time&#39; to go, its our time. Maybe we truly have no control over most things...well obviously, we truly don&#39;t. But if I can help my kids not being injured or killed I&#39;m SO THERE. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy son has gone under water twice unintentionally on my part. I lost my hold on him...it was terrifying but mama bear mode kicked in & I got him quickly. Thankfully he didn&#39;t swallow any water either. He didn&#39;t even cry either time. He has gone under in practicing exactly that & he loves it. So maybe this trust is also hand in hand with our child&#39;s age & competency. Some of our kids have amazing equalibrium & focus, & some are more challenged or even uninterested in taking more daring ventures. <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually would also let my son crawl or walk across the road if it weren&#39;t a busy one. In fact I HAVE. I made sure no one was coming as well before I let him get to the area cars drive on. I didn&#39;t stop him though but if I had to temporarily keep him from continuing I would, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been struggling with easing up on my daughter in regards to her bike helmet. My thoughts have been that I don&#39;t want her hurting her brain should she take a hard fall on her head...of course. Not one of us would want our child hurt. I don&#39;t think that isn&#39;t trusting her capability. It is just pure precaution, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not sure if I should just let her ride her bike & scooter w/out her helmet should she choose not to wear it or request that she wears it...what are your thoughts? I sometimes will ask her how she is going to keep herself safe outside when she goes & plays (we live in a resort where there are a ton of cars in the parking lot coming & going as well as strangers galore) & I feel better when we discuss that. I don&#39;t do this every time & in fact I haven&#39;t asked that in a few weeks. She roams all over the place around here. I trust her capability to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know that accidents can happen anytime, anywhere. I have heard that riding in cars or on bikes, say, is more risky than climbing a tree or riding in the back of a pick up truck on a dirt road (man, that makes me miss living in the country SO MUCH!!!). I was once on a ride in the back of a monster truck at a county faire & I felt so scared for my daughter & I. On one hand I knew that the driver of the truck was skilled at doing donuts in this thing (I didn&#39;t know we were going to do donuts in a monster truck!)despite that he was smoking a cigarette the whole ride...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter likes to climb up on our car (its an Isuzu trooper)& stand on the roof. She did this a few times in her old school&#39;s parking lot. You know how mellow Waldorf schools are about such feats...well you should have seen the looks on the parents teachers & kids&#39; faces as I allowed my daughter to just BE. One part of me was thrilled for her (& my self for being cool with her venture) & the other part was a tad concerned over what other&#39;s thought of my mothering her. I let her stay up there happily playing but after a while I started this demanding panicky talk insisting she get down. I now know that that was NOT what I was feeling...it was feeding into the mainstream thought that my daughter was in danger (which she might have been...just as a meteor could have dropped from the sky & landed on our heads or a cougar leaping out of the woods nearby)& going with that energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think besides the worry over my kids being hurt factor, I also worry over what others&#39; will think & that to the law, say, a lot of this &#39;trust&#39; we have as parents who live this way would be considered negligence & oh I can&#39;t think of the other term I&#39;m wanting to put here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis IS truly a shift for me as far as certain situations go for my children. In some &quot;areas&quot; I&#39;m cool with my daughter (she is almost 7)  & son (he is 20 months) going &#39;into&#39; alone & in others I&#39;m not there yet. I&#39;m sure this shift will take time. I agree that most children&#39;s agility is so much more able (& willing!!!) than the majority of adults. So really, I need to chill. Easier said than done. This is all a part of letting go & just LIVING life...going about it how I believe it should be lived. A part of deschooling myself. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a great discussion. One that is probably one of the top issues with those who want to unschool or are newer to accepting all parts in the basis of unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\n:)<br/>\n<br/>\np.s.: I love the freely given support so many of you give to us who still struggle in some areas...I am sure I&#39;m not alone in being dissed by some who have become so famous they do not make the time or select from certain parents or better yet, charge (& might I add, a pretty penny) for their expertise on unschooling. Or they play games & pick & choose who they want participating on their lists. This is very sad. I have met many a parent online who can relate to this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk...onto playing with my son. :O)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; -= do not agree with this.

Letting the kids ride in the back of my truck when we aren&#39;t on a trafficked road has flipped some of my friends out. I was letting them sit on the tailgate as we traveled between parking lots at ARGH (an unschooling gathering at Roan Mt. TN) which took all of 40 seconds and involved me driving so slow they could have fallen off and been fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ll drive them in the back around campgrounds or places where I feel comfortable doing so, because they love doing it and ask often. It was funny too, because one of my unschooling friends was REALLY uncomfortable seeing us pull up with my kids in the back of the truck at a recent gathering. I had let them move to the back after stopping to pay the park fee. I explained but she was still very uncomfortable and I just shrugged at that point. Not my problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater, we all were going up from the swimming area to a campsite where some out-of-town unschoolers were staying and ALL of the kids wanted a ride in the back of the truck. I had a truck bed full of happy, screaming unschoolers and it was all fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we react to things without a lot of thinking sometimes, because we&#39;ve been taught it&#39;s &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;irresponsible&quot;. Yes, bad things can happen but we don&#39;t even give a second thought to driving in vehicles, which is extremely dangerous but totally acceptable!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing alive is inherently dangerous. I think allowing children to take risk is a really important part of learning. I don&#39;t think we should ignore our need for safety, but there are ways to actively work with our children rather than being the big NO all the time. Not that &quot;no&quot; isn&#39;t useful at times too!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe big issue for us recently was about a pack of boys wanting to drift down the river we visit every week. They drift down over rapids and rocks, well beyond our hearing and sight. It&#39;s very uncomfortable at times but we talked about our discomfort and the kids really felt very capable and went on their way. One of us could have gone with them, one of us could have walked the river bank etc... there were other ways to meet both needs. In the end, there&#39;s a certain amount of &quot;testing&quot; oneself against nature and the world that humans get a lot of growth and confidence out of...just read about the walkabouts the aboriginal people used to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are ways our children might do their own &quot;walkabout&quot; in modern times. But it takes going against the grain of what conventional parents might allow a child. It takes not only trust, but working through challenges together and analyzing risk while examining where our own fears stem from. Is it useful fear or a knee-jerk reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\nJalen sprained his foot really bad this week, running down our stairs. Risk is everywhere. I had to examine my fears carefully as each of my children became interested in knives and whittling. Sharp knives can really hurt. In the end, I decided that cutting oneself is often part of the risk that I can live with. Even a bad cut can be stitched. So we talked about safe ways to use the knives and over all the years they&#39;ve had very small nicks but no bad cuts. Trevor got his first pocketknife around age 6 or 7. Children used to be trusted with driving tractors and sharp tools and such....they haven&#39;t gotten less capable of these things, they&#39;ve become less trusted as our society becomes more and more fearful about children and their ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\nradicalunschooling.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Robyn L.

His mom decided (while in utter fear) to walk away, let him be & <br/>\ntrusted in his capability as he himself what he was capable of. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLis, what I am seeing here is that you have heard some stuff that is <br/>\nextremely challenging to your world view and the paradigm of &quot;good parent&quot;. <br/>\nThis is causing you to react strongly with &quot;how can this be?!?&quot; feeling. I&#39;m <br/>\nglad you have come here to talk about it, and ask questions, because that <br/>\nvery discomfort that you are feeling is a sign that you are close to some <br/>\nkind of paradigm shift.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery child has different capabilities. Some have, and will always have, <br/>\nmuch greater balance and awareness of their physical space than others. Plus <br/>\nlittle kids tend to have a heavy head, but a low center of gravity when <br/>\nsitting (thinking of the child sitting on the edge of the water).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing of which we can be pretty much certain is that parents calling out <br/>\nthings like a generalized &quot;be careful&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t fall&quot;, or worse making <br/>\nnegative predictions like &quot;if you do that you will fall&quot; are distracting to <br/>\nconcentration at best, and strongly suggestive at worst. Most parents do not <br/>\nwant to accept that it is their own palpable fear and visible hovering that <br/>\ncauses their child to fall or fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience has been that most of the time, Jayn will be more accurately <br/>\nconservative about her own abilities or balance than I would have expected <br/>\nif I had been a conventional parent. Her ability to see and notice danger <br/>\nwas manifest much younger than conventional parenting ideas would have led <br/>\nme to believe also. Unschooling showed me how to maintain an assumption of <br/>\ncompetence and an assumption of good judgement on her part, that continues <br/>\ninto all kinds of areas as Jayn ages.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat does not mean I ignore my own fear or discomfort however. I have talked <br/>\nin the past about Jayn wanting to do &quot;gymnastics&quot; by balancing on her belly <br/>\non the rail of our second floor balcony when she was about 5. It was too <br/>\nnerve wracking for me, so I suggested that she could do the same thing <br/>\ndownstairs on a similar handrail that is at ground level, and I could even <br/>\nput down some padding. Jayn was willing, I could stand to spot her if she <br/>\nneeded it, and she never so much as wobbled. She agreed not to scare me by <br/>\nhanging over the balcony, and I agreed to come downstairs to watch her hang <br/>\non the low rail anytime.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother similar thing, that has nothing to do with Jayn&#39;s ability but my <br/>\ncomfort, is going to play outside the front gate of our building. I have <br/>\nundertaken to drop whatever I am doing and accompany her and her friends <br/>\noutside whenever they want to play there - which is rare and brief. This is <br/>\nbecause of my fears to do with strangers noticing unattended children (esp. <br/>\nduring school hours) than any concern about Jayn&#39;s ability to keep herself <br/>\nsafe. All they are doing is looking at the flowers or following squirrels. <br/>\nSometimes they like to talk to folk walking dogs, so I like to be there for <br/>\nthat too. My neighbor does not have these same concerns; she doesn&#39;t worry <br/>\nabout her two going outside since she knows they won&#39;t go away. It is a rare <br/>\ncase of me being the conservative parent!<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra kept something that I wrote about Jayn and safety on her site. <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/yes.html\">http://sandradodd.com/yes.html</a> Scroll down towards the bottom the &quot;Yes&quot; page <br/>\nfor my contribution, and a further comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the point about much of this is that children who are accepted and <br/>\ntrusted are less likely to want to express bravado or rebellion by <br/>\nattempting dangerous things against their own better judgement, and are also <br/>\nstill in tune with their own judgment. They are more likely to feel free to <br/>\nsay, &quot;No that&#39;s too scary for me&quot; if pushed by other kids, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nToddler Jayn fell into our pool once too. Longest 4 seconds of my life. She <br/>\nturned right instead of left and just walked off over the edge. She went <br/>\ndown then bobbed right up thanks to her layers of woolly clothing. I was <br/>\nable to fish her right out before she sank again, and was lucky that I <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have to jump in. She coughed once and then cried. I took her upstairs <br/>\nto get dry and warm right away. Maybe the parent with the child sitting on <br/>\nthe ledge was confident that she could get her baby out immediately in the <br/>\nunlikely event that the little one fell in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

Even in times where the child (in their most precious natural curiosity) is clearly in a potentially dangerous situation. Quinn&#39;s examples are in the clip above but one of them is how he was on a horizontal tree that hung out over the Grand Canyon where there was a 100 foot drop. His mom decided (while in utter fear) to walk away, let him be & trusted in his capability as he himself what he was capable of. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not agree with this. He was a young boy, not an adult. I feel a parent&#39;s &#39;role&#39; (Don&#39;t get me wrong. I do not mean that in a superior sense.) is to protect our children from a  potential life threatening situation. To me, this &quot;trust&quot; that many Unschoolers believe in in regards to these kinds of situations (where the child is young and/or does not know how  to swim yet or whatever-to not be within arms reach or below to catch them or something as they climb a tree more than say 20 feet...) is pure negligence & just downright foolishness. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know of a mom who said she &quot;trusts&quot; her 22 month old daughter (who does NOT know how to swim) who was sitting on a ledge (beside the sidewalk in a park) to not fall into the river below. there was at least a 2.5 foot drop to the water line & the water was at least 2 feet deep with large stones at the bottom. This little girl did not have a life jacket or floaties on. I myself would NEVER allow my child or any child in my care who doesn&#39;t know how to swim to do such a thing. And I would not leave my child, &quot;trusting&quot; that they will be safe, trusting in my trust in them as not to &quot;manifest&quot; the child to be in harm&#39;s way. That to me is pure ludacris. THAT is different than my trusting my child in what they choose to do. That is misuse of the whole concept in trusting our children&#39;s choices & interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I miss something here? I think not. I don&#39;t think I misunderstood the point he was trying to make & convince the listeners of..If anything he sounded insane about this. Yeah, he survived but...well. I still think its pure moronic thinking. Any thoughts on this sort of thought in Unschoolers? I don&#39;t feel THIS is what Unschooling is about.
