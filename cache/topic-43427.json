Sometimes it&#39;s like being the big<br/>\nfish in the small pond vs. being the small fish in the big pond.  Some<br/>\npeople, and this is what I&#39;ve seen on some local lists, want to be a big<br/>\nfish, and are very vocal about their ideas.  However, they don&#39;t bring<br/>\nthose ideas to the big pond because they don&#39;t want those ideas<br/>\ncriticized or shot down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey hide under the umbrella of &quot;this is working for my unique family<br/>\nand how dare you say you know better than I what is good for my unique<br/>\nfamily.&quot; or the &quot;unschooling spectrum&quot;, which is just another way of<br/>\nsticking to ones&#39; comfort zone by not having to change their thinking<br/>\nabout unschooling, or the possibility that they could be wrong about<br/>\nsomething they were so vocally upholding.  To me, that is arrogance,<br/>\nplain and simple.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling message boards have been very humbling for me, when I&#39;ve<br/>\ncaught myself being wrong about a long held assumption or belief.  I<br/>\nreally only write up ideas if I &quot;know&quot; I&#39;m thinking about it clearly,<br/>\nand if I&#39;m not, then it&#39;s nice to have others say something to let me<br/>\nknow where I may be stumbling.

I don&#39;t reply to every<br/>\nsubject line because some things, I feel, I don&#39;t know well enough to<br/>\ngive a helpful response.  I let other people do that and read and learn<br/>\nfrom those responses.<br/>\n<br/>\nLocal lists aren&#39;t like that though.  There are so few people that<br/>\nreally get unschooling nationally and internationally, and even fewer in<br/>\nones&#39; own community.  I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to meet a few in my own<br/>\ncommunity, largely by speaking my mind on local lists and having people<br/>\nwrite to me on the side.

That list grew  <br/>\nrelative large in number because it was closer to a metropolitan  <br/>\narea, and I think possible because it&#39;s near a city known for it&#39;s  <br/>\nprogressive and non-mainstream ways.  Like Jenny wrote earlier,  <br/>\nthere&#39;s just weirdness on the list.  But there are a couple others on  <br/>\nthe list who are willing to speak up the principles of unschooling  <br/>\n(not surprising, they also write and read here).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen these lists started, I think people wanted the meaty discussion  <br/>\nthat goes on on international lists and real life unschoolers to play  <br/>\nwith.  I certainly had the misguided idea that I&#39;d find families  <br/>\ninstantly that unschooled like the experienced and prolific writers  <br/>\non the discussion lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing what I know now, I encourage people to discuss at the  <br/>\ninternational lists, and give links to Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s sites.   <br/>\nI&#39;m working to combine our local lists and nudge them toward get  <br/>\ntogethers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember Joyce saying that local lists would be better for get  <br/>\ntogethers and the international lists are better for discussion,  <br/>\nbecause it&#39;s easy for people to get offended in discussions and maybe  <br/>\nmore hurtful if you know them in real life, and you get many more  <br/>\nvoices and experience on international discussion lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were talking about where people are getting misconceptions of  <br/>\nunschooling on this list a while ago, I went back and read through  <br/>\nwhat I wrote on our local lists to see if I was adding to that  <br/>\nproblem.

When this<br/>\nhappened on our local list, it was almost the exact same kind of thing. <br/>\nSomeone started a new list.  I joined that one and stopped visiting the<br/>\nother.  Ultimately what it did, was seperate out who I wanted to invest<br/>\nmy friendship energy with and I found some really amazing people because<br/>\nof that.  I could have continued on the other list and accepted outings<br/>\nwith some of those other folks and tolerated all the food control and<br/>\nsuch, but I&#39;m getting older and my kids are getting older and I want<br/>\npeople right here and now that I connect with and can talk to about<br/>\nunschooling and know that we are mostly on the same page.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn&#39;t mean that I have no tolerance for people new to unschooling<br/>\nand trying to understand it, it only means that I don&#39;t want to get into<br/>\ndiscourse with local people who aren&#39;t getting it and are very stubborn<br/>\nand borderline rude about their personal stance on unschooling.  I&#39;d<br/>\nmuch rather hang out with people who are actively searching for more<br/>\nunderstanding, which is what I do, or people who have no pretense of<br/>\nunderstanding something that they don&#39;t, like some of my older friends<br/>\nwho have kids in school, yet I love them just the way they are.  I can<br/>\ntotally deal with &quot;live and let live&quot;.  I can&#39;t deal with some of the<br/>\nweirdness that happens on local unschooling lists.

That&#39;s a little analogy about some people on local<br/>\nunschooling lists, only the people aren&#39;t critiquing  art and writing<br/>\nabout it, they are &quot;educating&quot; children and writing about it.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Local Lists","postDate":"1238192996","msgId":43439,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDBGRDUzOTgxLTUyQjctNDhDMy1BNTlBLUM2NDEyODUyRTRDNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDFmYTNlNzYxMDkwMzI3MTQ0M2gxZWNlYTI1ZXc4ZDM3NzBhMGExN2Q5Yzc0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDFmYTNlNzYxMDkwMzI3MTQ0M2gxZWNlYTI1ZXc4ZDM3NzBhMGExN2Q5Yzc0QG1haWwuZ21haWwuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":43430,"nextInTopic":43454,"prevInTime":43438,"nextInTime":43440,"topicId":43427,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=- It s hard to stick around and constantly defend Unschooling on an Unschooling list.
