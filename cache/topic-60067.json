I did notice that<br/>\nwhen he came in at first and wanted to watch I had no problem with it, a<br/>\nmajor change from a few years ago.

A few minutes later (during a<br/>\nsex scene that was particularly graphic) I said I&#39;d rather him only<br/>\nwatch it with us and not alone, so that if he saw something and had<br/>\nquestions we were available.  He said, &quot;uh, yeah, no, not asking you<br/>\nquestions about sex.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nHe does ask questions about sex and we discuss it just like everything<br/>\nelse.  He&#39;s almost 11 and talks a lot about girlfriends, but at the<br/>\nsame time turns his head when a breast is shown for too long on TV.<br/>\nSo he&#39;s at the stage where he&#39;s starting to see girls as different<br/>\nfrom boys, but he&#39;s not quite ready to know just how different.  Him<br/>\nand I have had lots of conversations about sex, starting somewhere<br/>\naround &quot;where do babies come from&quot; and including &quot;if two women can&#39;t<br/>\nhave babies, do they have sex.&quot;  Now that Parker is fully settled into<br/>\nthe role of 2nd mom he tends to ask her most of the questions, since<br/>\nhis father&#39;s reaction is &quot;you&#39;re too young to know about that.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m wondering if asking him to only watch it with us was the wrong<br/>\nthing to do.  I&#39;m not sure why I think it was the wrong thing, but for<br/>\nsome reason I have that nagging &quot;wrong reaction&quot; feeling in the back<br/>\nof my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nTina</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":60076,"nextTopicId":60059}}
