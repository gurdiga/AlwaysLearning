It<br/>\nmade this lady back off.  I was going to suggest that next time she  <br/>\ncome to me, but then I<br/>\nhad to have an honest moment with myself and realized that i would  <br/>\nhave probably acted<br/>\nin ways to &quot;keep the peace,&quot; not necessarily help my daughter.  This  <br/>\nwoman&#39;s drinking had<br/>\nall of us a little thrown.  She handled the situation in the only way  <br/>\nopen to her in that<br/>\nmoment, and she got the job done.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have occasional disagreements with my kids, but there is no  <br/>\nexpectation on my part that<br/>\nif I happen to be the one to raise my voice that they need to either  <br/>\n1.  be afraid of me, or<br/>\n2. acquiesce because of it.  And they do neither, because they have  <br/>\nthe trust now that I&#39;m<br/>\nnot &quot;pulling rank&quot; if I get frustrated and raise my voice.  It might  <br/>\nnot look peaceful in the<br/>\nmoment, but we usually end up with a new level of understanding, or  <br/>\nagree to disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were at a Waldorf school many years ago, people there put on  <br/>\na false persona of<br/>\n&quot;peace.&quot;  There was a very strong judgment about behaving peacefully  <br/>\nand if you did, that<br/>\nmeant that you were an enlightened person/parent.  Those parents can  <br/>\nbe just as<br/>\ndisconnected from their kids as the ones that yell a lot.  And there  <br/>\ncan be peaceful, quiet<br/>\nparents that are connected with their kids, just as there can also be  <br/>\nloud, raucous families<br/>\nthat are explosive and passionate and loving.</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":39571,"nextTopicId":39566}}
