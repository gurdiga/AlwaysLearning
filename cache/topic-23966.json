Some of those outings  <br/>\nhad the worst parts of school--lining up, not getting off the  <br/>\nsidewalk, various deprivations, feeling guilty if my kids had soda on  <br/>\nthe Pizza Hut tour because the other kids were only given water with  <br/>\ntheir pizza (yuck!), and my kids feeling bad because the other kids  <br/>\nstared at them longingly or resentfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-One of the mothers said to me, &quot;Wow, your gonna have a tough time  <br/>\nwhen she&#39;s<br/>\na teen&quot;.

They  <br/>\namount to curses, because really they make the statements HOPING I  <br/>\nwill have a bad relationship with my teens someday.    But someday is  <br/>\nhere, and my kids are still here, and we get along very well.   Their  <br/>\ncontrol and limitations do end up alienating their children and by  <br/>\nthe teen years the kids can&#39;t take any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids can probably take lots more of the happy treatment they get  <br/>\nhere. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething happened just last night that many parents would find a  <br/>\nfishy or unbelievable story.  Kirby and Rose Sorooshian (Pam&#39;s  <br/>\ndaughter) were going to karate, and the rest of us were going to see  <br/>\nBrokeback Mountain.  I figured we&#39;d be back later than they would,  <br/>\nand they would be hungry, and that they might want to go play Halo as  <br/>\nKirby usually does on Thursdays after class, so I made sure he had  <br/>\nenough money (he didn&#39;t need mine, though I offered) to take her out  <br/>\nto dinner, and said that if they didn&#39;t come back right away that was  <br/>\nfine with me.    They came back voluntarily, though, because they  <br/>\nwanted to hang out with the rest of us.  After being at the dojo for  <br/>\nthree hours (the two classes Kirby teaches and then an hour of  <br/>\nweapons), they came back without having had dinner, and so we all sat  <br/>\ndown and ate together.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad we pressured him to come straight home for years and years,  <br/>\ncoming straight home would be something to be avoided, at the age of  <br/>\n19 and a half.  We didn&#39;t, though, and it&#39;s not.  Had we been stingy  <br/>\nwith money for years and years, an offer of enough money for two to  <br/>\ngo out and eat would have been jumped at, but I offered money and he  <br/>\nvery politely said that&#39;s okay, he had some of his own.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":196090915,"authorName":"jnjstau@direcway.com","from":"jnjstau@...","profile":"jnjstau","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] My kid is quick to respond","postDate":"1137077273","msgId":23986,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDEyZDNiZDcxMmQ5MzkzLjEyZDkzOTMxMmQzYmQ3QGRpcmVjd2F5LmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":23966,"nextInTopic":24005,"prevInTime":23985,"nextInTime":23987,"topicId":23966,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-700269648\">&lt;&lt;You&#39;re not my mama&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have an outspoken, sure of herself daughter.

In a particular instance, she didn&#39;t follow the rules to the letter because she was helping a friend get notes for a class (she was supposed to leave immediately when classes were over).  I talked to her about how the women running the classes are used to being in total control of children and how Adriane was used to being trusted to be responsible, and about how to possibly find a way to reconcile the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, Adriane has found that if she needs to not follow a rule to the letter (like staying to share notes with a friend) that if she simply informs the women what she is doing and why, there is no problem and they gush over how helpful and friendly she is rather than complain about how rude and &quot;disobedient&quot; they thought she was.<br/>\n<br/>\nJulie S.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> ----- Original Message -----<br/>\nFrom: The Millers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:willowsfortress@...\">willowsfortress@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nDate: Wednesday, January 11, 2006 1:06 pm<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] My kid is quick to respond<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; &gt; Some adults just won&#39;t like my children because they&#39;re quick to<br/>\n&gt; &gt; respond, they aren&#39;t as likely as some to say &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; they<br/>\n&gt; &gt; might sing rude songs, they wear smart-aleck t-shirts sometimes<br/>\n&gt; &gt; (often about homeschooling).
