Twin studies put the genetic influence at a range of 50%-60% of alcoholism. Which means that environment plays a role of 40%-50%. The genetics are all tangled, it is not a single locus, it&#39;s a number of different things. And how they react with each other probably has a lot to do with the environment within which those genes play out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt isn&#39;t straightforward. Being the child of alcoholics isn&#39;t going to make you an alcoholic, but being both their child and raised in an actively alcoholic home might do it. And you might be the grandchild of an alcoholic with alcoholism not expressed in your natal home and have enough stress or neglect or whatever it is that flips that trigger so that the genes line up and express the alcoholism in a way that wouldn&#39;t have played out in a different home. Having the genes required for alcoholism doesn&#39;t predetermine alcoholism, it just tips the scale.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can be an alcoholic without the genetics, or so I assume (with discussions with David going on while I write this). Conversely, or so it would seem to me, you can be an alcoholic without the environment. Although Rat Park would argue against that. And I really like Rat Park. So, maybe you can&#39;t be an alcoholic without the right environment. Maybe addiction is a reaction to the environment as opposed to a disease that strikes unavoidably? I like that story the best. I think that&#39;s the one I&#39;ll tell. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I couldn&#39;t quite let go and send this. I found a look at the genetics of alcoholism and the studies that talk about where the pre-disposition may lie: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a><br/>\n/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=103780 I&#39;ll quote the introduction, which I found most interesting:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe tendency for drinking patterns of children to resemble those of<br/>\ntheir parents has been recognized since antiquity, e.g., in the<br/>\nobservations of Plato and Aristotle (Warner and Rosett, 1975). Alcoholism is probably a multifactorial, genetically influenced disorder (Goodwin, 1976).<br/>\nThe genetic influence is indicated by studies showing that (1) there is<br/>\na 25 to 50% lifetime risk for alcoholism in sons and brothers of<br/>\nseverely alcoholic men; (2) alcohol preference can be selectively bred<br/>\nfor in experimental animals; (3) there is a 55% or higher concordance<br/>\nrate in monozygotic twins with only a 28% rate for like-sex dizygotic<br/>\ntwins; and (4) half brothers with different fathers and adopted sons of<br/>\nalcoholic men show a rate of alcoholism more like that of the biologic<br/>\nfather than that of the foster father. A possible biochemical basis is<br/>\na metabolic difference such that those prone to alcoholism have higher<br/>\nlevels of a metabolite giving pleasurable effects or those not prone to<br/>\nalcoholism have higher levels of a metabolite giving unpleasant<br/>\neffects. Schuckit and Rayses (1979) found that, after a moderate dose of alcohol, blood acetaldehyde levels<br/>\nwere elevated more in young men with alcoholic parents or sibs than in<br/>\ncontrols. A certain degree of organ specificity in the pathologic<br/>\neffects of alcohol is observed. For example, patients have<br/>\ncardiomyopathy, cirrhosis, or pancreatitis but rarely more than one of<br/>\nthese. A genetic basis of organ specificity is evident in<br/>\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (277730) and pancreatitis from type V hyperlipidemia (238400). Cloninger (1987) identified 2 separate heritable types of alcoholism. Type 1 alcohol<br/>\nabuse had its usual onset after the age of 25 years and was<br/>\ncharacterized by severe psychological dependence and guilt. It occurred<br/>\nin both men and women and required both genetic and environmental<br/>\nfactors to become manifest. By contrast, type 2 alcohol abuse had its<br/>\nonset before the age of 25; persons with this type of alcoholism were<br/>\ncharacterized by their inability to abstain from alcohol and by<br/>\nfrequent aggressive and antisocial behavior. Type 2 alcoholism was<br/>\nrarely found in women and was much more heritable. Abnormalities in<br/>\nplatelet monoamine oxidase activity were found only in type 2<br/>\nalcoholics (Von Knorring et al., 1985). See comments by Omenn (1988).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leads me to this: <br/>\n<br/>\nPsychopathology in adopted-out children of alcoholics. The Stockholm Adoption Study.<br/>\nCloninger CR, Bohman M, Sigvardsson S, von Knorring AL.<br/>\nThe<br/>\ninheritance of alcohol abuse and other psychopathology was studied in<br/>\n862 men and 913 women adopted by nonrelatives at an early age in<br/>\nSweden. Both male and female adoptees had a greater risk of alcohol<br/>\nabuse if their biologic, but not adoptive, parents were alcoholic. We<br/>\ndistinguished two types of alcoholism that have distinct genetic and<br/>\nenvironmental causes and that differ in frequency of alcohol abuse and<br/>\nsomatoform disorders in women. The combination of both genetic and<br/>\nenvironmental risk factors is required for development of alcoholism in<br/>\nthe most common type. In contrast, in families with the less common<br/>\ntype of susceptibility, alcohol abuse is highly heritable in the men,<br/>\nbut the women have multiple somatic complaints without alcohol abuse.<br/>\nThe implications of these findings of genetic heterogeneity and<br/>\ngene-environment interaction are discussed in relation to research,<br/>\nprevention, and treatment.<br/>\nOh, now I&#39;m all distracted. Maybe it answers some questions? <br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: BRIAN POLIKOWSKY &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:polykowholsteins@...\">polykowholsteins@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Friday, 6 February, 2009 8:25:24 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Alcohol<br/>\n<br/>\nI absolutely think some people are genetically predisposed to be and alcoholic.<br/>\nHaving said that having a happy childhood, being raised by wonderful parents,<br/>\nbeing an unschooler is not the same as some kids and adults that drink to make live bearable, <br/>\nthat drink out of stress, pain , to escape life, to rebel......<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\nAlex Polikowsky<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://polykow.blogspot.com/\">http://polykow.blogspot.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nYahoo!

But, it is an extremely important thing to address, with my boys,<br/>\nI believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband and I do not drink any alcohol. My mother was a closet<br/>\ndrunk and actually she died from her alcoholism in october of 2006. I<br/>\ndid not know she was an alcoholic until I was 19-20 yrs old (that&#39;s<br/>\njust 6 years before she died). My father drank in front of us.. he was<br/>\nvery open with his alcohol consumption, which, in my opinion as an<br/>\nadult, was bordering and sometimes overstepping what I would consider<br/>\nan appropriate amount of alcohol for a parent to drink while being the<br/>\nsole adult responsible for a group of children. As a kid, he was just<br/>\nvery funny and cool. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up and never drank alcohol.. never even tried alcohol until I<br/>\nwas probably 23 or 24 years old. I wasn&#39;t scared of getting in<br/>\ntrouble... I didn&#39;t really grasp alcoholism or the fact that my<br/>\nparents were both heavy drinkers. I just wasn&#39;t interested. I drank<br/>\nresponsibly for a couple of years, as an adult,  and I got drunk maybe<br/>\ntwo or three times, in those years and it was kind of fun, but I<br/>\nthought, not as fun as if I had been sober.. alcohol never really did<br/>\nanything for me, it was a lot more expensive than soda or water.. so,<br/>\nI never really understood the appeal. It just didn&#39;t seem to have any<br/>\naffect unless I drank a ton of it and got smashed. Which was stupid,<br/>\nto me. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy brother is an alcoholic. A real alcoholic who drinks a lot and has<br/>\na lot of trouble with the law because of drinking.. and cannot grasp<br/>\nthat, at this point, he is unable to control how much alcohol he<br/>\ndrinks. It&#39;s sad really and it sucks. I worry about him a lot. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband is an alcoholic who has been fighting with alcoholism since<br/>\nhe was like daggone 10. He&#39;s been sober for a bit over 2 years. His<br/>\nfather was very non-chalant about alcohol and frequently gave him a<br/>\nbeer or two on fishing trips and such. His maternal grandfather was an<br/>\nalcoholic. As an adult, he has no control over how much alcohol he<br/>\ndrinks.  At first, it seems like he can say.. just one beer. But, it<br/>\nwill slowly progress into downing a pint of vodka in just a couple<br/>\nswallows. It&#39;s scary, it&#39;s nerve wracking... there&#39;s been times when I<br/>\nthought he was probably going to die.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back at my family, there is not a generation that has not been<br/>\naffected by alcoholism. My great grandpa was.. my meemaw & my<br/>\ngrandfather had to completely stop drinking because of alcoholism..<br/>\nall of their children are alcoholics - two of them have died from<br/>\nit... and all of my cousins are alcoholics,... I seem to be the only<br/>\none who is unaffected by this. I am also the only one who chose not to<br/>\ndrink alcohol under age. Maybe there is a correlation, maybe not. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I hope alcohol is something my boys just won&#39;t be drawn towards.<br/>\nIt is something I cannot model for them. I could probably drink<br/>\nalcohol just fine (that&#39;s really just a guess that I wouldn&#39;t want to<br/>\npush too far)... but, out of respect for my husband, I do not.. out of<br/>\nremembering what it did to my mom, I just don&#39;t do it. To me it is not<br/>\njust a drink... I&#39;ve watched it destroy people&#39;s bodies, and destroy<br/>\nlives, and tear families apart... I know, in excessive amounts.. but,<br/>\nthe threat is there - they all started by drinking in moderation. If<br/>\nalcoholism is genetic, the threat is very real to my children. If it&#39;s<br/>\npassed down, somehow, in genes, there is a high probability that if my<br/>\nsons drink.. it will be their destruction, regardless of what I have<br/>\nsaid to them or modeled for them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t intend to just say, &quot;Alcohol is bad. Blahh.&quot; But, I will be<br/>\nvery adamant about the necessity for caution in their experience. <br/>\nIt&#39;s scary to think about.

It&#39;s not stated, but  <br/>\nthey&#39;re not invited and I don&#39;t offer them beer if they&#39;re over, which  <br/>\nis sometimes in itself what gets them easily gone within a couple of  <br/>\nhours. Because my kids don&#39;t know and love them, the acoholism (and  <br/>\nrelated accidents and arrests and job loss and relationship  <br/>\ndestruction) don&#39;t bother them as much.  I hear about it, but one  <br/>\nthing I&#39;m glad I learned when I went to adult children of alcoholics  <br/>\nmeetings in my 30&#39;s is detachment.  I&#39;m able to see that my nephew&#39;s  <br/>\nlife, my half-brother&#39;s life, my cousin&#39;s life, are not MY life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would love to find out the whole genetics model is something else  <br/>\nonly obliquely &quot;causing&quot; alcoholism in individuals, but seeing kids  <br/>\nwhose grandparents and great grandparents I knew (or knew from photos  <br/>\nand stories and knew the details of their sometimes alcohol-related  <br/>\ndeaths)...  it&#39;s hard for me not to be very glad for my own kids that  <br/>\nthey only have one alcoholic grandparent of four.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s easy for people without any genetic alcoholism to think  <br/>\nmoderation will do it for life.
