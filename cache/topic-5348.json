Intuiting the<br/>\nmany solutions and choosing the most efficient, fun, or aesthetically<br/>\nappealing makes &quot;problems&quot; a source of constant joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you naturally tend toward this mode of being, it feels unnatural to<br/>\nfollow directions.  Most  problems (maybe all - haven&#39;t seen &#39;em all yet)<br/>\ncontain their solutions - you just need to look at them right.  This, btw,<br/>\nis most assuredly not something I learned in school.  It&#39;s something school<br/>\ndidn&#39;t quite beat out of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mental mode where one looks at a problem and visualizes / imagines /<br/>\ninvents a solution is very different than the skill of reproducing a set of<br/>\nsteps in sequence as told to you - i.e. &quot;The&quot; solution, the answer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving out of this preferred and strongest mode is not fun. It&#39;s work, come<br/>\nto think of it.  And I&#39;m not a big fan of work. It&#39;s to be avoided if one<br/>\nhas a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if I have to do something really important (well I have a specialist do<br/>\nit and pay them with money I make doing what I&#39;m good at, but if I am stuck<br/>\nsomewhere or something...) then I will seek &quot;The Solution&quot; and follow the<br/>\ndirections. And I probably won&#39;t like it.  But, I acknowledge both modes are<br/>\nconducive to survival and success.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I (a non-direction follower) can, if I&#39;m painted into a corner, do many<br/>\nthings in ways that are not at the core of my nature.  I can adapt to the<br/>\ntask and adopt a new mode.  I try to show my son (who is prone to a mode of<br/>\nseeing like my own [only his is wild and free in a way mine never was]) by<br/>\nexample, that there are times when you just have to let someone else tell or<br/>\nshow you how to do something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes the discomfort of operating in a mode you are not accustomed to is<br/>\na growth process.  The important thing to grasp is that you have a situation<br/>\nthat calls for a mode-switch as soon as possible, once you&#39;re there.<br/>\nClosing in on 40 and I am still working on this one...<br/>\n<br/>\n(Skydiving - that&#39;s one I won&#39;t be figuring out on my own.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing the directions takes patience and discipline, two things I am a<br/>\nlittle short of.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t see and admire the beautiful<br/>\nefficiency, the pure elegance, of doing something without the effort of<br/>\ntrial and error.  I love watching someone do something like put together<br/>\nhardware that requires detailed instruction-following.  Just like I love<br/>\nwatching people do lots of things I am not so good at doing.  I like reading<br/>\nshort e-mails too ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my .75c<br/>\nMark</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":1051378,"authorName":"SandraDodd@aol.com","from":"SandraDodd@...","profile":"duckfordu","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Video Games","postDate":"1015617326","msgId":5424,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGRlLjIzODA2ZjkzLjI5YmE3MTJlQGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":5420,"nextInTopic":5437,"prevInTime":5423,"nextInTime":5425,"topicId":5348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 3/8/02 12:49:00 PM, zenmomma@hotmail.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-739955504\">In a message dated 3/8/02 12:49:00 PM, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zenmomma@...\">zenmomma@...</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; He could always easily manipulate Transformers and things whose <br/>\ndirections would make my head spin.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\">  &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Transformers have directions!?<br/>\nMarty&#39;s the only one here who does them, and so I didn&#39;t know that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is the most like his dad who is a code-checking engineer too.<br/>\nAnd Kirby is most like me, and he&#39;s Mr. Social Organization.<br/>\n<br/>\nYesterday Keith was making a wrap-front cloth thing to go over his armor.  <br/>\nKind of a cross between a gi jacket and a medieval surcoat.

(Why do people narrow <br/>\ntheir thinking down to either-or so quickly?)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a computer game by the learning company called Treasure Mountain.  <br/>\nYou catch elves, answer math questions, get clues and then get tokens hidden <br/>\nunder the right objects.  The objects you choose have to have two out of <br/>\nthree of the aspects of the key object (which you determine by earning clues <br/>\nyou get by buying nets, catching elves, and answering questions).  So if the <br/>\n&quot;right&quot; answer is three round trees, you also benefit by clicking on three <br/>\ntriangular trees, or two round trees, etc.  It&#39;s a cool reasoning exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Marty, when he was little, he played it a whole different way.  He <br/>\nclicked on every object or set of objects.  If he got a token, he had a clue. <br/>\n He clicked until he knew where the key was.  He totally ignored the elves.   <br/>\nBut clicking costs a coin.  Where&#39;d he get the coins?  He discovered what the <br/>\nrest of us never needed to know.  If you were totally broke, the game would <br/>\nleave you money on the ground.  So Marty was using the welfare money and <br/>\nmaking it entirely a deductive reasoning game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t think Marty learned less than Kirby and Holly did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMarty is also more likely to put things together without the directions--just <br/>\nthrow all the parts and bolts out there and see the thing.

But, a tidbit...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve read &quot;Flow : The Psychology of Optimal Experience&quot;<br/>\nby Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, but it is an excellent analysis of how the mind<br/>\nworks under stress, and he puts forward the idea that the optimum mental<br/>\nstate is one where stress (i.e. demand on a particular faculty of the mind /<br/>\nbody)<br/>\nis pretty precisely balanced with skill level and the capabilities of the<br/>\nindividual.<br/>\nWe usually call activities producing this state &quot;games&quot; by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis optimum performance point is reached in sports (he uses tennis as a<br/>\ngood<br/>\nexample), chess, reading, even conversation.  I can tell you that all of my<br/>\nbest work<br/>\nas a programmer is done within flow (otherwise known as &quot;the zone&quot;) where<br/>\nthere is not only a high degree of organized, productive, mental effort, but<br/>\nalso<br/>\na timeless and largely ego-less experience of &quot;fun&quot; (for want of a better<br/>\nterm).<br/>\nA day of work can be totally refreshing, if I can overcome the institutional<br/>\nobstacles to getting into, and staying in, Flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis applies to video games, to my point of view, because video games are<br/>\none<br/>\nof the only places that my son can _reliably_ enter the flow state and<br/>\nremain there<br/>\nfor lengthy periods of time.  My dw used to think it was frightening that<br/>\nour son, even<br/>\nwhen he was four would &quot;zone out&quot; with a game for several hours at a time,<br/>\nnot<br/>\neating, not drinking, not speaking.  But I recognized it as &quot;zoning in&quot; -<br/>\nhitting<br/>\nthat place of experience where you are optimally performing and using (while<br/>\nimproving) your skills.  At times this is (I don&#39;t want to get melodramatic)<br/>\nblissful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in our culture, I think we reflexively wonder, since it&#39;s very pleasant<br/>\n(and we can do it<br/>\nwithout consuming something - eek!) must it not be &quot;habit-forming&quot; and<br/>\ntherefore<br/>\nbad?  This, assuming we can not ALL agree on the benefits as we might with a<br/>\nrunning<br/>\nhabit or workout habit, or painting habit, or gardening or music composition<br/>\nhabit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I think that the experience of flow itself is good for the brain, good<br/>\nfor the<br/>\nchild.  It uses the brain the way it is designed to operate optimally - or<br/>\nat least<br/>\none of it&#39;s optimal modes.  What seems to get lost is the idea that video<br/>\ngames are<br/>\n&quot;games&quot; first.  High tech, but still games.  For &quot;fun&quot; - fun comes at all<br/>\ndifferent<br/>\nintensity levels, and perhaps the most intense is flow.  The thing about<br/>\nflow is that<br/>\nit is personal.  Two tennis players are not playing &quot;together&quot; if they are<br/>\nin flow.<br/>\nNeither are two chess players.  They are in their own solitary worlds.<br/>\nBasketball players<br/>\nand other team players have a different kind of optimal level - they always<br/>\nhave to keep<br/>\nsome attention available to monitor environmental conditions, signals, and<br/>\nso on. For<br/>\nsome reason this lower intensity level is less disturbing to onlookers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut video games are solitary and we see the flow for what it is - total<br/>\nabsorption<br/>\nin a solitary productive/recreational activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstitutions can&#39;t exercise good control over people in a flow state and so<br/>\nthey break<br/>\nit up, by changing the demands, creating distractions, adding elements of<br/>\nboredom<br/>\nthat break up the focus.  I think schools do this and I think workplaces<br/>\noften do<br/>\nthis.  In my industry, we can get around it much of the time.  But you still<br/>\nhave phones,<br/>\nmeetings, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho - games (especially video games) train one&#39;s mind to enter the flow<br/>\nstate<br/>\nand maintain it.  This is why my son can kick my butt at every game, without<br/>\nexception,<br/>\nthat we have every played together, including challenging ones like Jedi<br/>\nPower Battles<br/>\nand Ace Combat 04.  He has already learned to enter and maintain a flow<br/>\nstate, which<br/>\nis optimal for learning as well as performance, better than I have with<br/>\nabout 35 years of<br/>\npractice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy are games good for kids?  I think that is the essence of why video games<br/>\nare NOT<br/>\nbad.  Well, some are bad, but some are clearly good - great in fact.  The<br/>\nsame can be<br/>\nsaid for anything.  Books, movies, even people.<br/>\n<br/>\nVideo games are so solitary, and that is scary for people who, like me, grew<br/>\nup immersed<br/>\nin crowds of (mostly) strangers.  There&#39;s no authority figures to tell you<br/>\nwhether you&#39;re<br/>\nright or wrong - there&#39;s only the rules of the game and the score.  But<br/>\nbeing comfortable<br/>\nwith solitude, is just being comfortable with reality.  We can connect, we<br/>\ncan relate, but<br/>\nat the end of the day you are who you are and that is just one person.  I<br/>\ndon&#39;t think<br/>\ngiving a child the choice of solitary pursuits is such a bad thing.  If they<br/>\nplay non-stop<br/>\nfor 30 days, it&#39;s getting out of hand.  If they are wasting away to bones<br/>\nand flesh while<br/>\nachieving Yoda-like levels in one game, ok, it&#39;s too much.  But my<br/>\nobservations have shown<br/>\nthat these games have a natural life-cycle.  My 7yo can complete a &quot;typical&quot;<br/>\ngame in a<br/>\nweekend, with lots of time for other activities mixed in when he loses the<br/>\nability to<br/>\nsustain flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think learning to recognize and sustain flow is learning to operate your<br/>\nmind in one of<br/>\nit&#39;s primary optimal states.  Openness, such as meditation is another<br/>\noptimal state, very<br/>\ndifferent from flow - perhaps it&#39;s diametric opposite...<br/>\n<br/>\nFlow completely transcends all boundaries of the game, games in general, and<br/>\nthis state,<br/>\nwhen cultivated as a personal capability can be one of the most powerful<br/>\ncapabilities<br/>\none can develop.  As an adult, I use it every day - from programming, to<br/>\ncomposition<br/>\nto polishing the car.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much for the flow tidbit.  Just putting out a feeler to see if this is<br/>\nsomething, you, Sandra,<br/>\nor any others want to discuss in more detail offline, or slowly here.  Any<br/>\ninterest?<br/>\n<br/>\nMark Kenski<br/>\n(sneaking in with Cris&#39;s ID - I haven&#39;t gotten mine set up yet)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":851978,"authorName":"Jocelyn Vilter","from":"Jocelyn Vilter &lt;JVilter@...&gt;","profile":"jocelynv2001","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Digest Number 263","postDate":"1015522132","msgId":5359,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEI4QUNFMzUzLkYwNTElanZpbHRlckBtYWMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDNDODc3QUYyLjkwODA0QG1pZHNvdXRoLnJyLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":5356,"nextInTopic":5363,"prevInTime":5358,"nextInTime":5360,"topicId":5348,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
