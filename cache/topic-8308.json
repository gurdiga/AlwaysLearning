True it&#39;s work<br/>\nbut it does refresh me and give me a needed boost about research or<br/>\nteaching. Last year I ended up spending one night a week away in Dubai<br/>\n(about 2 hours away) and at first it was kind of neat but then got very<br/>\nold. When I first started spending the night away I couldn&#39;t sleep as well<br/>\nbecause it was so unusual NOT to be kicked or poked with little feet or<br/>\nelbows. It was good because it made me realize that I actually missed it --<br/>\neven though I still get annoyed sometimes at 3 am:)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom and I just spent 10 days together in Europe and it was really nice.<br/>\nAgain it made me appreciate my kids so much more when I got back. But I<br/>\ndon&#39;t leave mine until they are somewhere between 3 and 5 years so with<br/>\nanother one due in a few months this was my last solo fling for awhile!<br/>\n<br/>\nKate<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 11:46 AM 8/3/02 -0400, you wrote:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt;    On 3 Aug 02, at 3:33, jsutfran wrote:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; Hi all -<br/>\n&gt;&gt;   A week? <br/>\n&gt;&gt;   With friends?<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m looking for ideas for this fall....<br/>\n&gt;&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I used to go away for a four-day weekend with a bunch of friends <br/>\n&gt; every year.

The <br/>\nthing is, you can&#39;t go for just one day.  You need a couple of days just <br/>\nfor the static to clear out of your head, and for your ears to stop <br/>\nperking up at every little noise that you think might be some body, some <br/>\nthing or some dog needing something from you.  And then you need a few <br/>\ndays just to get good and bored, and then you need the last few days to <br/>\nget through that, too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI actually didn&#39;t get too bored.  I read 10 books while I was away, and <br/>\nI gave myself permission to not read the ones I brought and go to the <br/>\nbook store and buy more.  While I was at the book store, I came across a <br/>\nbook called &quot; The Marriage Sabbatical&quot;, which in some cosmic <br/>\nOprah-related coincidence turned out to be the book that planted the <br/>\nidea in me for a sabbatical in the first place.  I recommend this book. <br/>\n And also &quot;The Women&#39;s Retreat Book&quot;.  (I&#39;m sure other people can tell <br/>\nyou the authors...I&#39;m terrible remembering them.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also read &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;, &quot;The Four Agreements&quot;, &quot;The Red <br/>\nTent&quot;, and &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot;, among others.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to Corpus Christi, TX and rented part of a beach house, so I had <br/>\ntime and space to just hang out on the beach and fix myself simple food. <br/>\n There was no TV reception, so that worked out well.  I did find the <br/>\npublic library and send emails to my family keeping them updated.  I <br/>\nrented a car so I could drive around, because that&#39;s good thinking time. <br/>\n I went to San Antonio and communed with the tourists, and Padre Island <br/>\nseashore and communed with the hornets which were attracted to Burt&#39;s <br/>\nBees stuff in my backpack.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea was to let myself get completely bored, and then see what my <br/>\nhead would come up with.  The only thing I wouldn&#39;t allow myself to do <br/>\nis go home early.  I ate well, drank good wine, burned candles.  The <br/>\nonly people I spoke to were waitpersons and the pesky guy who came to <br/>\npaint the beachhouse, who kinda gave me the creeps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe things my head came up with can&#39;t really be explained, but I still <br/>\nfeel refreshed and renewed.  It was a good experience, and my dh, who <br/>\nwould have never thought of such a thing, has decided he wants to do <br/>\nsomething like it for his 40th next year.

She told me (past<br/>\ntense) about lots of her good times. Visited theme<br/>\nparks....went to puppeteering conferences....SLEPT<br/>\nLATE EVERY day and took lots of naps. Didn&#39;t clean<br/>\nhouse. But actually....this is not too different from<br/>\nherself when she did work, except the the scuba<br/>\ndiving...which she isn&#39;t perseuing as she didn&#39;t like<br/>\nit so much. Just too athletic. And no particular<br/>\nschedule, except what she wanted. No transportation<br/>\nprovided for the kids, just herslef. She did have some<br/>\nfibroids removed, laproscopically. And she did take<br/>\nthe time to SHOP for her doctors, for herself. She<br/>\ntold me it was a SABATICAL when she stopped doing for<br/>\nothers. But now she is in school doing what (I<br/>\nconfided was my fantasy...I want to  have an art(s and<br/>\ncrafts) &quot;school&quot; for children). Sigh. She will do well<br/>\nwith it, I am sure. She is sweet, personable,<br/>\ncharming, sociable, pretty, and she pays attention to<br/>\nRoy without hurting his feelings..something few any of<br/>\nmy other realtives do (and I gratefull) But then she<br/>\ndoes remember how hard she made my life when the older<br/>\nboys were little.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had the same, I suspect I would do differently,<br/>\nbut Roy is only 8, her youngest child (of 3)is 16.

It might be a problem for<br/>\nmost stay-at-home-moms.  Also, her daddy paid for her<br/>\ncollege, before and most of their first house and her<br/>\ncars. She is his only child, and I refused to allow<br/>\nhim custody (he didn&#39;t DARE contest) when I legally<br/>\ntook her from Mother. Anyway...time off has to be paid<br/>\nfor somehow...her children have devoloped  some<br/>\nproblems as younge adults in the past year. Or mayabe<br/>\nshe is just more aware of the problems, now. Dunno.<br/>\nThey were day-care/public-school/so she could do her<br/>\nstuff kids. Or maybe the problems are just more<br/>\ninteresting to talk about, now, that it is harder and<br/>\nless expected to do personal intervention.?  Is that<br/>\nalways the cost for parents?

I&#39;ve done it twice; once when I had just one kid, and I<br/>\nleft him with grandparents and spent a day and a night in a cabin in a nice<br/>\nlittle camp. I was bored stiff; wrote a little and read (usually I could<br/>\nread till I drop and often do) and finally went into town and caught a<br/>\nmovie. The other was after our first year of homeschooling and I left the<br/>\nkids with dh, spent the entire day in Barnes and Noble and then met a friend<br/>\nfor dinner and a movie. And yes, the house was trashed both times. What&#39;s up<br/>\nwith that?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve always dreamed of going for a week to a retreat, but who knows how I&#39;d<br/>\ndo if there weren&#39;t movies available? I do better with mini-retreats, even<br/>\nif it&#39;s just in the house or lunch to myself now. Or I catch a movie... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren<br/>\n<br/>\n-----Original Message-----<br/>\nFrom: jsutfran [mailto:<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:jsutfran@...\">jsutfran@...</a>]<br/>\nSent: Friday, August 02, 2002 10:33 PM<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Sabbaticals<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHi all -<br/>\nHave any of you taken time off for yourself?
