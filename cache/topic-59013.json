She basically had a good message.  Stop treating boys like girls.  There is a total lack of respect for boys and their culture in schools.  They are told they can not write about things they like, play games they like or be themselves.  She calls for people to make better educational games for kids, games that are actually more than glorified flash cards to help get boys interested in curriculum and she also said that most teachers talk about the things that boys like, like video games with distain.
