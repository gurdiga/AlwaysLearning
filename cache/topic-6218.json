Waaaaaaaa!).<br/>\nI think there is a big difference in the relationship you can have <br/>\nwith an only child or two.<br/>\nIf even one of mine is gone, it makes a big difference in the time <br/>\nspent with the others and the way they relate to each other.<br/>\nIt&#39;s different.  Not better or worse.<br/>\nIt&#39;s definatley not perfect and sweet here all the time.<br/>\nLots of high energy.  <br/>\nJoanna(no &#39;h&#39;) ;-)</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":74158751,"authorName":"Cottonwood Farm","from":"&quot;Cottonwood Farm&quot; &lt;angus@...&gt;","profile":"welove2farm","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Pictures / Johanna","postDate":"1019088126","msgId":6218,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMGEwMWMxZTY2YyQ0YjZhNTIwMCQyMjI1YTFkOEBkZWZhdWx0Pg==","referencesHeader":"PGE5a3V2MytvcTlmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":6245,"prevInTime":6217,"nextInTime":6219,"topicId":6218,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I m one of the people that rarely hops on board but I did take a few minutes to look at the pictures.

I had not seen all the pictures for a while..finally took the <br/>\n  time to look.<br/>\n  Joyce and Mary are NOT what I pictured!! It&#39;s very hard to match <br/>\n  images in your brain with reality sometimes.<br/>\n  I pictured Mary as this long, dark haired person....kind of asian <br/>\n  looking. She looks a lot like ME!! LOL<br/>\n  And Joyce I had an older image with dark hair...why do I always <br/>\n  picture people with dark hair?<br/>\n  It&#39;s so neat to see the happy smiling faces irl that I chat with here.<br/>\n  And all those free and joyful kids!!<br/>\n  I actually had a similar image of Sharon (of the swamp) in my <br/>\n  head....amazing! So one out of three&#39;s not bad?<br/>\n  Ren<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n        Yahoo!
