So we bring a small popup tent.  He can retreat into it.  play with his legos or ds or read or snack.  When he gets overwhelmed with his friends or siblings he has a place to retreat.  Home away from home.  It really helps and he actually plays more with the other kids at the playground when given that option.<br/>\nIt requires more planning but in the end everyone is happier.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":126919745,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Peaceful parenting two (or three or four) small kids","postDate":"1273356395","msgId":53960,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCRTVFMDZCLjIwMzA0MDBAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGhzNGIwbytpM2pwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhzNGIwbytpM2pwQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":53959,"nextInTopic":53971,"prevInTime":53959,"nextInTime":53961,"topicId":53835,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Summary: siblings with not-matching plans / wishes, Mom seeing no other option than to decide this or that, forcing one of the kids (or both) to give in.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo more examples and a new question:<br/>\n<br/>\nSituations in which I feel my childs adversary:  1) Today at the playground it started to rain. My 1yo was obviously no longer happy to be outside; my 4yo was not done playing yet. I said something like: `I would like to go home. What would you like to do before we leave?&#39; She named three things and I agreed.  After these, she made new plans, but I said we were really leaving now. Result: two kids crying on the way back home, me being very frustrated. 2)  My 1yo climbed on a chair and started to play with the cd&#39;s. I said: `Would you like to hear some music?&#39; and helped him open one and showed him were to put it in. Then my 4yo said: `But I don&#39;t want music on! I cannot draw with music on.&#39; She doesn&#39;t want to be in a room alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nNew question: I read a few times that you think a young child (even up to nine years old?) is not able to make a (long term) commitment. That would make it not very useful to end a playground session the way I did. What would be a good alternative?<br/>\n<br/>\nEveline<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginal posting:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn certain situations I often end up being my childs adversary: situations in which different children have different plans, which are impossible to combine. Like: being at the zoo with one child that likes to see the animals and one child that likes to spend the whole day on the zoo playground. Or being at home with one child who wants to stay at home and one child who wants to go somewhere.  (Kids to young to be without an adult)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy kids are one year and four years now, so these situations are still avoidable. We sometimes get in these when we make a date with other (homeschool) families, when we have  a child visiting or when I work as a `guestparent&#39; (`daycare in our house&#39;). But it&#39;s only a matter of time: one day my youngest will have plans of his own. And of course he has his wishes already, for example he falls asleep the easiest and most peaceful in the backpack while I walk, so if he gets tired, for him it&#39;s best that we plan a trip to the playground at that moment, but his sister is not always prepared to leave just then...<br/>\n<br/>\nI read `Siblings without rivalry&#39; and I guess this would be a good moment to reread it! But I&#39;m also very curious about your ideas about this. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso wondering: what place do you give your own preferences as a parent?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Hmmm, I realize now that my example of a date with a homeschooling family has to do with MY preference: MY preference to stay together as a group. Of course we have the option of splitting up if my daughter doesn&#39;t want to leave the playground with the others - which we did last time and nobody but me minded, I think.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main question is about siblings with not-matching plans.
