School? Now?<br/>\nBut a bunch of my facebook friends seem to have &quot;not back to school&quot; rituals where they do something fun to mark the time of year. It *is* a good time to go and do fun, touristy kinds of things, since it&#39;s still good and warm but the crowds disappear. If someone&#39;s feeling stressed by &quot;back to school&quot; pressure, planning some &quot;not back to school&quot; adventures may be a good way to keep those fears at bay. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283530155,"authorName":"JustSayin","from":"&quot;JustSayin&quot; &lt;mfcappella@...&gt;","profile":"mfcappella","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Not back to school jitters...again","postDate":"1315608858","msgId":62854,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGo0ZTVlcStpNm5oQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0N3RycyszaW5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62841,"nextInTopic":62859,"prevInTime":62853,"nextInTime":62855,"topicId":62817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This isn t really advice but I loved this quote and it seems to fit this thread: I hope that someday the legend of The First Day of School will be just a dim","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-16346069\">This isn&#39;t really advice but I loved this quote and it seems to fit this thread:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I hope that someday the legend of The First Day of School will be just a dim memory from an unenlightened time.&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\n-- Wendy Priesnitz (on her blog)<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing changes for us in August vs. September.

Learning happens in surges forward and sometimes with falling back and forgetting what you once knew. It can help to notice that You&#39;re learning and growing, too, as a side effect of unschooling. That&#39;s a good thing! <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; In past years, I have allowed this reoccurring struggle of mine to seep into our days and ruin the flow for everyone.

If it helps you to have plans, plan for a big outing once a month, maybe - a concert or museum or amusement park or convention or camping trip.... whatever sort of thing your son would enjoy that&#39;s in your budget. Plan for other little things weekly. If you need an agenda have it be keeping things fresh and interesting or big and rich. <br/>\n<br/>\n---Meredith</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Not back to school jitters...again","postDate":"1315406375","msgId":62818,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDExNzFDRDZGLTU3MjMtNEE2NS1BNkE0LTAyMTMxQzVFNjU0NUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGo0N3RycyszaW5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGo0N3RycyszaW5zQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":62817,"nextInTopic":62841,"prevInTime":62817,"nextInTime":62819,"topicId":62817,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-Our days are full, and fun, and happy.
