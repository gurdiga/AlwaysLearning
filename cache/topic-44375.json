I&#39;m  <br/>\ngrateful to all of you who help keep it so rich and interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m hosting a symposium on unschooling in Santa Fe in January 2010.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve been hesitant on putting out a big push, because I don&#39;t want to  <br/>\ncreate any conflict with other things that have already been  <br/>\nplanned.  I&#39;ve been &quot;laying low,&quot; but I do have a contract with the  <br/>\nfacility and a headful of ideas and plans.  The connection with this  <br/>\nlist is that although anyone who attends will get to participate, my  <br/>\nmain guests will be Pam Sorooshian, Joyce Fetteroll, and all of my  <br/>\nfamily and theirs&#39;. The dads&#39; session will have Cyrus Sorooshian   <br/>\n(his first name sounds like his last name, not like American &quot;Cyrus,&quot;  <br/>\nbut like SoROOS Sorooshian; it&#39;s pretty), Carl Fetteroll, and Keith  <br/>\nDodd.  Other dads too, with other experiences, but as a core group,  <br/>\nthis is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause space is limited, if you decide your family is serious about  <br/>\nwanting to attend, please let me know.  It will help with planning.    <br/>\nThe site is a former time-share condominium complex on the north side  <br/>\nof Santa Fe, on the road to the ski basin, within walking distance of  <br/>\nthe plaza, called Fort Marcy Condo Suites Hotel.     Please don&#39;t try  <br/>\nto make reservations yet or you&#39;ll mess us up--they&#39;ll go through a  <br/>\nlink on my site when we&#39;re nearer the time, but I have a contract so  <br/>\ndon&#39;t worry.  We&#39;ll have 39 units, mostly two-bedrooms, with the  <br/>\npossibility of adding a few more if those fill up.  There is an  <br/>\noverflow hotel possibility at the same rates.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might seem ironic, but the site isn&#39;t an indoorsy carpeted hotel,  <br/>\nand there are stairs, and there might be snow, and we only have  <br/>\nsmallish meeting spaces, so this isn&#39;t an ideal event for families  <br/>\nwith small children.   It&#39;s better for families with teens, or (yes,  <br/>\nbrace yourselves) for parents without their kids.   It might be great  <br/>\nfor a couple of dads, or a few moms, to come without the families.   <br/>\nOr if you bring small children, plan to bring someone to do something  <br/>\nfun with them during the sessions (or to stay in the condo with them  <br/>\nor to go visit Kirby&#39;s place and play games or something).  There  <br/>\nWILL be families, and lots of teens, but the focus is on exploring  <br/>\nthe ideas and philosophy of unschooling.  And the main attraction is  <br/>\nSanta Fe itself.  I don&#39;t want to schedule so much that people don&#39;t  <br/>\nget to explore the town some!  We&#39;ll be walking distance from the  <br/>\nplaza.  Easy walk down there, not as easy coming back up the hill,  <br/>\nbut it&#39;s certainly doable for the  young and strong, and old folks  <br/>\nlike me might be able to call for a ride.  Driving, even easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m partly sorry to talk about this here because I know most of you  <br/>\nwon&#39;t go, but the benefit to this list should be noticeable.  Even  <br/>\nthough I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a better unschooling list available,  <br/>\nafter some of us get to share our very best ideas in person, and when  <br/>\ndozens have had the experience of meeting some of the others who  <br/>\nwrite here and getting to observe and speak with some of their teens,  <br/>\nwe&#39;ll all have more knowledge as it&#39;s shared back onto this list and  <br/>\ndiscussed some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery conference has this effect, but this symposium will focus on  <br/>\nthe depth of why unschooling works, and on what has been learned by  <br/>\nfamilies with teens who were parented so differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible, but not definite, that Schuyler Waynforth and her  <br/>\nhusband David will also be guests of the conference.    When that&#39;s  <br/>\nknown for sure, it will be stated here, but I won&#39;t harp on the  <br/>\nsymposium on this list at all.
