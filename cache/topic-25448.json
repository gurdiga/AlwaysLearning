My husband<br/>\nhad always wanted to homeschool them and he has always been basically an<br/>\nunschooler in many ways.  That is, his approach to the kids learning is way<br/>\nmore unschooly and life-oriented than mine is.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn&#39;t until I found JOhn Holt&#39;s books and Growing Without Schooling<br/>\nnewsletters in the library that I could see how it might work.  I loved his<br/>\nwritings, but couldn&#39;t seem to bring myself to desert the &quot;schooly&quot; things<br/>\naltogether for several years.   We would go back and forth.... less<br/>\nstructure or more, depending on circumstances.  I&#39;m not sure exactly why<br/>\nthis has been such a difficult process for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m making a serious try at it, now.... last year was spent deschooling<br/>\n(myself, mostly) and this year I&#39;m trying to replace it a bit with &quot;real&quot;<br/>\nthings.   It doesn&#39;t come that easily.   It helps that our parenting<br/>\napproach was always sort of reciprocal and &quot;attached&quot;.    I can see that <br/>\nresponsiveness works with parenting, but somehow it&#39;s more difficult to <br/>\nextend that to academics.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hated school all through and didn&#39;t feel I learned anything, so why did I <br/>\nthink it would work for my kids?  Maybe I thought it would be different if <br/>\nit wasn&#39;t a building.   I am not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWilla</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":25321,"nextTopicId":25446}}
