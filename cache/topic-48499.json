She  <br/>\nmight not, but her website will endure somewhere between &quot;for a while&quot;  <br/>\nand &quot;for a long time.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, what if you could look at her writings with her voice and her  <br/>\nface in your mind?   What if you&#39;d get a chance to just hang out with  <br/>\nher and eat, and maybe meet her husband and daughter?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat&#39;s one of the things this upcoming symposium in Santa Fe is about.<br/>\nThere&#39;s only one three-bedroom condo left in our set, but there are  <br/>\nseveral one- and two-bedrooms left.   Those are $79 or $99 a night, if  <br/>\nyou register before the end of November, and they&#39;re real dwelling  <br/>\nplaces you could live in.  Full kitchen, living room, fireplace, and  <br/>\nmy husband Keith and I will make sure you have some firewood and  <br/>\nkindling and matches for those fireplaces.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conference fee is $100 for one person, $150 for two, $180 for  <br/>\nthree, and $20 additional per family member after that.  We will  <br/>\nevening meals together.  One will be a potluck.  One night we&#39;ll play  <br/>\nApples to Apples and another night we&#39;ll have Show and Tell  <br/>\n(potentially like a talent show, but no one needs literally to sing or  <br/>\ndance).<br/>\n<br/>\nMore information is here:<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/suss\">http://sandradodd.com/suss</a><br/>\nand that has links to a blog with photos and to a registration page<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m really looking forward to seeing Joyce again myself, but I promise  <br/>\nnot to hog her attention, so others can hang out with her.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48498,"nextTopicId":48504}}
