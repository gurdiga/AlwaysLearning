We lived in CO for 7 years  <br/>\nand the grandparents were in MO and CA. Then it became a hobby to do  <br/>\nit, regardless if anyone else looked at it! I don&#39;t do scrapbbooking  <br/>\nso this is my &quot;scrapbook&quot;. I love the dynamic nature of the pages,  <br/>\nand when I get bored with a layout, I can easily change it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the &quot;plug&quot;, Sandra! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n**********<br/>\ncarelia ~ C.
