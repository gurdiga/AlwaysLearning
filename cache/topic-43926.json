My oldest is 11 and I don&#39;t think I gave her enough choices so she focused on what she loved, when she was around 3-4 she mostly lived on pop tarts and chicken nuggets at home, she was in daycare so I justified my bad food with &quot;she&#39;s getting good food there&quot;. Now she is so picky but we have been moving toward a much broader range of foods, why? Because I stopped forcing and letting her choose whether or not to eat what we were eating. The one thing I did succeed with her was we always had a candy drawer at a low level in the kitchen. It had whatever recent holiday candy had happened in there(usually supplied by grandma), suckers, chocolate, candy corn, you name it. it was always available. My oldest to this day doesn&#39;t eat much candy but will stop at one or two pieces to satisfy a sweet tooth. We often had to throw out stale candy or just give it away when we knew the candy in there was one we didn&#39;t like.<br/>\n<br/>\n My two younger children eat pretty much whatever they want if they say no I offer something else and I have to concur with the group and say Monkey Platters are genius! I would do all meals that way excepting we like having a family sit down meal each evening. Today I witnessed the best results of this method, the two year old had half a pb&j in hand(she had finished her ham sandwich earlier and was still hungry or maybe just hungry again) and the one year old had half a ham sandwich which she was ignoring while chowing down on apple. The one year old had explored the sandwich, taken it apart, took a nibble of the ham, cheese and gone back to her apple. The two year old looked over at the uneaten sandwich and told me she wanted that and not her pb & j which she had taken a couple bites of already. I promptly put the sandwich back together and gave it to her. She said in two year old &quot;I&#39;m really hungry&quot; ignored the pb&j and chowed down on the ham sandwich. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf only I could convince my husband who wants them to eat before they get sweets or juice or drinks. He is of the, I was raised that way and it worked for me mindframe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, keep offering and offering, don&#39;t give up on something forever just because they say no, also if they see you really enjoying that thing they said no to it sometimes will gt them curious again.</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":294520986,"authorName":"Joanna Murphy","from":"&quot;Joanna Murphy&quot; &lt;ridingmom@...&gt;","profile":"ridingmom1","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Intro and food","postDate":"1239212105","msgId":43941,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdyaW44OStqZTR1QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDc3NDQ1MS41MDgyNy5xbUB3ZWIyNzAwNi5tYWlsLnVrbC55YWhvby5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":43935,"nextInTopic":43953,"prevInTime":43940,"nextInTime":43942,"topicId":43926,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"However I am having probs with letting go of the control I have/had over what my children eat.

Put familiar foods on the monkey platters as well as new ones, but don&#39;t focus so much on having your daughter have to come up with the ideas on her own.  Think in terms of saying yes to food more often rather than them having to make all the choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo much sudden freedom can be scary--you can move in that direction in a more supported, safe way.

Once I&#39;m hungry enough to <br/>\nsay, &quot;I am really hungry,&quot; then something weird goes on in my body/brain <br/>\nand not many things sound good to eat. Lots of times the only thing that <br/>\nwill sound good will be, for me, a muffin or some cake or bread/jam or <br/>\ncookies. Maybe cereal. Or potato chips might do it. In other words, the <br/>\nthings that will sound appetizing will usually be flour and sugar and <br/>\noil and eggs (mixed and baked, of course, not separately &lt;BEG&gt;). Or <br/>\ncrunchy and salty, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am really hungry, an apple, carrots, anything raw like that feels - <br/>\n&quot;harsh&quot; to me - like it will be hard on my stomach. Meat and other <br/>\nhigh-protein things sound heavy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I don&#39;t let myself get really hungry, but stop and eat something (an <br/>\napple or the equivalent) before I get to that point, then all kinds of <br/>\nother things sound just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I am hungry I do NOT want to experiment. I want what I know will <br/>\nget rid of the hunger immediately. I don&#39;t want to take the risk that I <br/>\nmight not like something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I&#39;m really hungry, sometimes all the foods I can think of sound <br/>\nsickening to me and I&#39;ll get hungrier and crankier while I keep <br/>\nthinking, &quot;I should eat. I should eat.&quot; I&#39;m 57 and I know better than to <br/>\nkeep putting it off, so I&#39;ll make myself eat something.
