Did she ask for more information?  If so, was it to adjust her teaching style for your daughter?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen my always unschooled daughter was 8 she too insisted on going to school to see what it was like.  I put her on the waiting list for a small progressive charter school that had combined grade classrooms and a high teacher to student ratio.  I hoped that by the following year my daughter would no longer be interested but she was overjoyed when we got the call that she would be accepted for the soon-to-begin new school year.  However, while the teachers assured me that they didn&#39;t use grades, that she could progress at her own pace and that they were highly flexible, it didn&#39;t turn out that way.  They were still beholden to many of the public school system&#39;s rules.  They still new exactly where each student fell academically.  They still insisted on writing assignments that were harshly critiqued and they still made my daughter sit in during recess to &quot;catch up&quot; on math.  Other similar things and the catty peer environment crushed much of my daughter&#39;s previous enthusiasm and she left before 4 months was up.  It took over a year before she would write for fun again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t see how giving the teacher any info on unschooling is helpful.  It will still be a school and she will still be a teacher and your daughter will not be unschooling there.<br/>\n<br/>\n~Michelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Dana Briscoe &lt;danabriscoe@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;m interested in your suggestions for articles available on the internet<br/>\n&gt; for educators that are genuinely open and intrigued by the concept of<br/>\n&gt; unschooling.
