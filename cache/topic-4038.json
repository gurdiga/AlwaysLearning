I never knew the name for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt our old house, pre-kids, we had a roommate with jumping boxers (dogs, <br/>\ny&#39;know) and so he and Keith put up a verticle-slat fence on frames, really <br/>\nhigh.  Cinder-block wall 6&#39; tall, so they raised this wall up so it started <br/>\nabout three feet up and went up about nine or ten feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt didn&#39;t keep the jumpingest dog in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the story is that it was made of some weird odd wood the lumber yard had <br/>\nwanted to get rid of--the last of a custom job.  They were odd-shaped boards, <br/>\nlike 1x6, and each was made of a sliced 2x6, and they came stacked carefully, <br/>\nand the guys put them up carefully.  So with no other benefit to the world, <br/>\neach two were &quot;book matched&quot;!    All the way around the back yard, sets of <br/>\ntwo mirror-matching boards.  <br/>\n<br/>\nCheap thrills, but fun to look at, and as we had little kids they all <br/>\n&quot;discovered&quot; it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4032,"nextTopicId":4001}}
