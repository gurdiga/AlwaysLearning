It gave us great places to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn retrospect we should have figured out the bus system in addition  <br/>\nto BART. We did a lot of walking. A lot. :-) But we got to experience  <br/>\nSan Francisco up close and personal in a way we wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe saw Chinatown three times on the way to various places and only  <br/>\ngot to see the Golden Gate Bridge from a distance ;-) The wait for  <br/>\nthe trolleys was way too long (though supposedly it&#39;s less at  <br/>\nEmbarcadero but we never got off there) but we saw them plenty! We  <br/>\ngot to walk up Lombard Street. Japantown (since Kat has a big  <br/>\ninterest in manga and anime and Japan in general.) Bought lots of  <br/>\nmanga and tea on the trip. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nApparently Alcatraz needs reservations 3 months in advance during the  <br/>\nsummer, at least for the National Park Service ferry (I think it  <br/>\nwas).

Also, there are the <br/>\nremnants-of-the-60s sights.  And our humble abode, which is about 10 <br/>\nhouses north of the Berkeley line.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of art schools over here on this side of the bay <br/>\ntoo.  An older one, California College of Arts and Crafts.  And one <br/>\nthat sounds intriguing to me, a digital arts one, called Ex&#39;pression, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.expression.edu/\">http://www.expression.edu/</a>  .<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for San Francisco, I&#39;d go to the Embarcadero BART station on <br/>\nSaturday, and cross the street to an amazing farmers market and the <br/>\nextravagant food hall at the Ferry Building.  You may not be able to <br/>\nafford much but what you eat will be delicious and you&#39;ll get some <br/>\nidea of this area&#39;s passions about fresh, local food..  Then you can <br/>\nwalk or rent bikes or any number of bizarre vehicles or just take an <br/>\nold fashioned trolley down the embarcadero and enjoy the views.  Pier <br/>\n39 and Fishermans wharf are ultra touristy but Pier 39 has all the <br/>\nsea lions that hang out there and at Fisherman&#39;s wharf, there&#39;s a <br/>\nplace that has all these cool old arcade games from the old Playland <br/>\nat the Beach.  It&#39;s called Musee Mechanique, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.museemechanique.org/\">http://www.museemechanique.org/</a>  And in the Cannery, one of those old <br/>\nfactories-gone tourist shops, near the shop that only sells socks, <br/>\nthere&#39;s the coolest musical instrument store, Lark in the Morning <br/>\n(they have a great catalog too), where you can try everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso from the Embarcadero BART, you can take a cable car which I <br/>\nstill love  even though only tourists ride them.  The crowds at <br/>\nEmbarcadero tend to be smaller than the crowds at Powell Street for <br/>\nthe cable car.  The cable cars have fabulous views from the tops of <br/>\nhills, so try to be where you can see out.  The cable car museum is <br/>\non the route and free and really cool if anyone is into transit or <br/>\nlocal history.  It&#39;s amazing they&#39;ve been running theses things the <br/>\nsame way for over a hundred years.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also love Zeum, which is right in the middle of town.  Maybe we <br/>\ncould do that with you, cause it&#39;s fun with a group?  There you can <br/>\ndo claymation, video production, perform and record kareoke, do <br/>\ncomputer graphics, an, my favorite, play on a life size labyrinth <br/>\n(the tilting kind with a metal ball).  And that&#39;s right near the SF <br/>\nMuseum of Modern Art and bunches of other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there&#39;s Golden Gate Park with a few days worth of stuff to <br/>\ndo.  That would mean a bus ride from BART, but not hard.  And renting <br/>\nbikes there would be great cause you could see a lot more that <br/>\nway.  The Conservatory of Flowers is way cool and I think the <br/>\nJapanese Tea Garden is fun, but touristy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr...you can take the ferry across the bay to Alameda (where we&#39;re <br/>\nhaving our unschoolers park day on Friday!) or Oakland.  If you go to <br/>\nOakland, you can walk to a real Chinatown, not the more touristy San <br/>\nFransisco one.

If you go to that area you can walk to the palace of Fine Arts <br/>\nand to the bay to get a good view of the Golden Gate Bridge. In that <br/>\nsame area is the Exploratorium (sp?) which is THE best science museum <br/>\nI&#39;ve ever been to!! Wow...Have fun, I&#39;m envious!
