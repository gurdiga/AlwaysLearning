It left me with so many <br/>\nQUESTIONS!!  What did the potion do when it spilled on the boys<br/>\nhand?  Was he already on the road to recovery prior to the discovery<br/>\nof the potion and his positive attitude helped him heal himself?  Do school <br/>\nkids<br/>\nin nice small towns really beat up on terminally ill children?  Would<br/>\na parent with a child who was terminally ill really be so harsh and<br/>\npunitive?  We were shocked at the parents behavior, including the<br/>\nno funeral thing and spanking? He was a teen for goodness sake! And <br/>\nwhat WAS Mr. Rice&#39;s story????  My goodness I sure hope that this movie<br/>\nwas adapted from a book because I need to KNOW these things &lt;G&gt;!<br/>\nWhen the movie first started we were all kinda like not wanting to<br/>\nsee the movie as the boy had a terminal illness, and that was scary<br/>\ndepressing but once we got into it we got over it. Dd was convinced <br/>\nthe boy would live as movies have happy endings (her words).<br/>\nDs said I&#39;m not going to get sick and die am I?  Poor thing.<br/>\nI think it was a bit mature for them in that instance but it was things<br/>\nwe were able to talk about.... and the whole decoder ring, well you<br/>\nwon&#39;t find that baby in a box of cereal. Geez every kid (and mom!)<br/>\nshould have one of those!  Ok so if anyone has seen this movie<br/>\nand has some ideas or more things for me to ponder, please do!<br/>\n(or answers I need answers!!!LOL)<br/>\nKathy</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3625,"nextTopicId":4099}}
