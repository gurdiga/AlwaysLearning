They are killing those movies.  And it&#39;s &quot;Crimson Tide,&quot; <br/>\nnot &quot;The Crimson Tide&quot; (unless it&#39;s some Alabama football documentary).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s part of the pin they stuck in Much Ado about Nothing:<br/>\n<br/>\nRomantic Relationships: <br/>\n2.  During the first part of the play, why were Beatrice and Benedick always <br/>\nsaying unpleasant things to each other? <br/>\n3.  The witty banter of Beatrice and Benedick shows that they are both very <br/>\nintelligent. Why were they unable to see that they cared for each other? Why <br/>\ndid Benedick say such stupid things about marriage? How could people as smart <br/>\nas Beatrice and Benedick not realize their affection for each other and then <br/>\npermit themselves to be brought together by a transparent deception? <br/>\n4.  The relationship of Hero and Claudio is so frail that it can be destroyed <br/>\nby the deceptions arranged by Don John. What does this say about their <br/>\nrelationship? <br/>\n5.  Do you think that Hero and Claudio are mature enough to make rational <br/>\ndecisions about romance and marriage? At the beginning of the film, were <br/>\nBenedick and Beatrice making rational decisions about romance and marriage? <br/>\n6.  How does this film show the cruelty of love? Give at least two examples. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does this schoolification of perfectly good movies gag me?  Let me count <br/>\nthe ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nNah. Let me not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the comments were okay, but to inflict all that on a child who just <br/>\nwants to watch a movie with his mom is horrible.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night we watched Forrest Gump--my husband, me, Marty and Holly.  Holly <br/>\nwas making a castle with blocks at the same time, and we didn&#39;t draw her <br/>\nattention to gross or sad parts.  We identified famous people by name if the <br/>\nnarration hadn&#39;t done so, and we didn&#39;t make any speeches.  We answered kids&#39; <br/>\nquestions and commented to their comments, but there certainly wasn&#39;t a <br/>\ntest!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think a set of questions on each movie would turn kids against movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":3880872,"authorName":"Karen","from":"&quot;Karen&quot; &lt;kbmatlock@...&gt;","profile":"mattieleah61","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Movie site","postDate":"1015419375","msgId":5339,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEJORUFJS0ZJTUlMREZIQ0JQUE1NQUVOQkNOQUEua2JtYXRsb2NrQHlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":5340,"prevInTime":5338,"nextInTime":5340,"topicId":5339,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Uh-oh.
