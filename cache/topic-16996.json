What a horror. I&#39;d rather live<br/>\ncautiously than ever have to live through something like that.**<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, but, but....   neither of those girls was kidnapped while away from home <br/>\nand their parents oversight, nor was their kidnapping the result of careless <br/>\nor unsafe behaviour on the part of the child. How on earth can their tragedies <br/>\nbe seen as a mandate for not allowing children to go or be places on their <br/>\nown? Not to mention that that kind of situation is thankfully extremely rare - <br/>\nif it were common we wouldn&#39;t all recognize their names - in the same way that <br/>\npeople across the country do NOT know the name of the boy who died in a <br/>\nbicycle/car accident in my town last week.<br/>\n<br/>\nChildren out and about in their neighborhood are rarely at danger from human <br/>\npredators as much as they are from automobiles and stray dogs. Most sexual <br/>\nabuse of pre-pubertal and young adolescent children is committed by persons the <br/>\nparents have brought into their home or in other ways given express access to <br/>\nthe child. People the parents &quot;know&quot;. Not strangers. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeborah in IL<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":16985,"nextTopicId":16965}}
