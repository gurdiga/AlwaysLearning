I compare it to asking adults to do this.  I have on<br/>\noccasion really confused a well-meaning mom forcing her crying child to hand<br/>\nover a backpack to be examined by others and to have her personal<br/>\npossessions scattered.  The mom is usually pontificating on sharing but<br/>\nlooks just horrified when I ask if this extends to me rooting around her<br/>\nhandbag.  However were I to go through her handbag, use her cellphone or try<br/>\non her makeup she would probably not see the &quot;value&quot; of sharing.  If I did<br/>\nso without permission, especially.  Children do have personal possessions<br/>\nand they get to choose what happens to them.  I have seen moms lend their<br/>\nchild&#39;s sweater to another without asking, too.  Adults do not respect<br/>\nchildren&#39;s bodies or possessions for the most part.  This often gets<br/>\nobfuscated in the great sharing debate.  We certainly expect a generosity<br/>\nfrom children that we aren&#39;t willing to demand from adults:)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has to be a balance.  My kids have had toys stolen, and broken.  That<br/>\nis very hard.

It was outside a<br/>\npark bathroom.  We looked everywhere, and he wondered if the kids who had<br/>\nused it earlier took it, thinking it abandoned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of the mothers had been so happy that he &quot;shared&quot;, and wanted the<br/>\nsecret.  I never gave it much thought that kids don&#39;t have the luxury of<br/>\ntheir own belongings.  Rowan had no problem lending the trike out and many<br/>\nkids had used it. For the most part I had modelled sharing inadvertently by<br/>\nsharing with him and his dad.

Sometimes, those things don&#39;t work, and my 4.5 year old still doesn&#39;t want to share something, and neither child will be drawn away to other toys or distractions, and it seems to me like a huge tantrum or fight over the toy is not realistic in that place with those people, and I do say, &quot;Temima, each child is going to have a turn,&quot; and I often turns on a timer or something to mark time and give each child turns.  She seems to accept that best.  It doesn&#39;t happen so often, or I would limit those kinds of outings if possible.  It doesn&#39;t seem fair to me to make the other child not have access to a certain toy at all because I don&#39;t enforce sharing, if the situation develops where the two really only want that one toy at the same time.  Does this sound like a good way of dealing with these kinds of situations?   <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nShira</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":171830749,"authorName":"nycartgal2003","from":"&quot;nycartgal2003&quot; &lt;mranzer@...&gt;","profile":"nycartgal2003","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Hello and Goodbye, and sharing","postDate":"1290467490","msgId":58186,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGljZXRiMis1cnY0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PEQ5REVGMzExLUY2RTEtNDM0QS04OEM3LUFFOTA5ODM5ODYzNkBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":58184,"nextInTopic":58190,"prevInTime":58185,"nextInTime":58187,"topicId":58162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"** A child can say something or wave, or smile, or SOMEthing, without being forced to say goodbye.

I  <br/>\n&gt; understood the comment in context, but it was awkward, and NOT the way  <br/>\n&gt; I think, or Holly thinks.  Different for the sake of being different  <br/>\n&gt; isn&#39;t any requirement of unschooling.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; The opposite of &quot;do everything that&#39;s expected&quot; might be &quot;do NOTHING  <br/>\n&gt; that&#39;s expected.&quot;<br/>\n&gt; We shouldn&#39;t be living by rules, nor by an opposite version of the  <br/>\n&gt; rules.

I want Logan to have family in his life who love him just as he is.:::-:::<br/>\n<br/>\nMy sister has judged my first-born and our parenting style from my eldest&#39;s birth.  I totally relate to the desire to have one&#39;s child unconditionally loved.  Just because one has family does not guarantee that all family members know how to love unconditionally.  I prefer my children (and my hubby and myself) maintain boundaries we are comfortable with our family as well as others.  As a result, we recognize that each one of us chooses what actions we take (hellos, goodbyes and sharing).  If others around us are affected in a way that merits discussion, there&#39;s always room for acknowledgment and discussion, but I cannot choose for my daughter what she will say (hello/goodbye) or feel/do (share).  As it turns out, my eldest prefers to say, &quot;See you soon,&quot; -- she hates goodbyes.  And when she shares (she&#39;s 4), it&#39;s because she really wants to share, not because she has been pressured to share by others&#39; expectations.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nCeci  <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iDon&#39;tAlwaysHaveItOnPhone<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Hello and Goodbye, and sharing","postDate":"1290397632","msgId":58166,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDUwMTQ0MS43OTA4OS5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MDQubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGljY2x2bitkcmsxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGljY2x2bitkcmsxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":58165,"nextInTopic":58168,"prevInTime":58165,"nextInTime":58167,"topicId":58162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"***It just does not seem to be enough for many adults.

Many adults expect kids to behave like <br/>\nmini adults.  Kids are still learning social cues, some easier than others on <br/>\nthat front.  Even so, I don&#39;t always say &quot;good bye&quot;, sometimes I leave if there <br/>\nis a window to leave and will send a text or email or give a quick call a bit <br/>\nlater saying that I was sorry I hadn&#39;t said good bye.  That usually only happens <br/>\nin group situations.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith family, we have prolonged good bye rituals that involve the host family <br/>\nmembers doing exaggerated waves from the front steps to wave the leaving car <br/>\ngood bye.  Everyone in the car waves back until we no longer see each other. <br/>\n It&#39;s just what we do.  If a kid doesn&#39;t say good bye, they can wave from the <br/>\ncar.  That might be a lot of fanfare, but it&#39;s fun and it makes for happy good <br/>\nbye&#39;s.  The good bye is an implied gesture from everyone in the whole, not put <br/>\nupon a single person, adult or child.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt bothers me that there are adults who expect kids to meet their level and then <br/>\nare disappointed with the kids for not doing so.  We try to avoid those kinds of <br/>\nadults!  Adults should meet the child where they are at, in general.  However <br/>\nsince those kinds of adults exist, our kids must find ways to deal or not deal <br/>\nwith them, and as parents we can help by being a buffer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think it&#39;s rude and anti-social for an adult to have expectations <br/>\nof children that aren&#39;t even remotely developmentally appropriate.  I assume <br/>\nit&#39;s because they weren&#39;t treated kindly as a child and forget what it&#39;s like to <br/>\nBE a child.  Sometimes I remind adults like that about how they felt meeting <br/>\nstrangers or relatives they didn&#39;t see often as a child.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember clearly how I felt in those circumstances.  I felt both shy and happy <br/>\nto see people that I liked but didn&#39;t see often.  It always took a few hours to <br/>\nwarm up and get in the groove of those connections.  It took adults being <br/>\nfriendly and kind and welcoming.<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":416719225,"authorName":"mari teaches","from":"mari teaches &lt;mari.teaches@...&gt;","profile":"mari.teaches@ymail.com","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Hello and Goodbye, and sharing","postDate":"1290396890","msgId":58170,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEFBTkxrVGk9M2k5ZGlIZzRra0w4V0cyLVdmdzlyVFZVd096M1pQT0c2N2NDLUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGljY2x2bitkcmsxQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY2NDk2Ny4xMTUzMi5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTUubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPgk8aWNjbHZuK2RyazFAZUdyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":58169,"nextInTopic":58171,"prevInTime":58169,"nextInTime":58171,"topicId":58162,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"hello group, i been on this list a while. i know I am a lurker and always in the shadows reaping in all the great advice.
