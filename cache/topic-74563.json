Having grown up myself with a hovering mother who I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1656059665\">My eldest child has always liked to climb and explore, often to a point that is past my own comfort levels. Having grown up myself with a hovering mother who I think contributed to me being scared of so many things, I made a conscious decision very early on to try not to project my own fears on to Caitlin. So from when she was very young, probably 18 months or so, she was climbing structures at the playground and inside I was worrying - but I stayed close and didn’t say anything, and helped her when she asked for help. I soon found that she would climb to a point and then stop and either come back down or ask for help - she very quickly learnt her own levels of comfort and didn’t ever push past them. When I had my second child he was more cautious and I worried that he would follow her beyond his own capabilities - (and again I stayed close but didn’t comment) - and I quickly found that he would stop when he felt he’d gone far enough, and was happy to let Caitlin go on ahead as far as she was confident to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of my kids have fallen when they are climbing (there have been a few slips and scrapes but no big falls) and all 3 of them have differing levels of ability and comfort when climbing. I really think that by letting them climb as far as they felt safe they have all learnt to trust their own bodies and sense of what is and isn’t safe and that in itself helps them be safer. There have been times when they have asked for help to get down and I have either climbed up to help them or talked them down if they were just too far for me to go without freaking out myself. So they do sometimes go further than I feel is safe - but I have realised that that’s because I wouldn’t feel safe there, but for someone who is comfortable with climbing it is not unsafe - and I’m pleased that none of them have learnt my fear of heights and of climbing even though its still something that scares me. (And watching them climb so confidently has actually helped me to be a bit braver with some climbing and heights and my own fear is diminishing very slowly. Perhaps I am learning more to trust my own body rather than rely on my learnt memory of what is and isn’t safe)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnie</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":50712510,"authorName":"","from":"michelle_m29@...","profile":"michelle_m29","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Play structures","postDate":"1406592405","msgId":74570,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxyNm9pbCsxMDh2YjA4QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEZDRjE3MDk2LUFDMjEtNDU3Qi05Qjg3LTBCMjM3REQ3NjM5REBnbWFpbC5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PEZDRjE3MDk2LUFDMjEtNDU3Qi05Qjg3LTBCMjM3REQ3NjM5REBnbWFpbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":74567,"nextInTopic":74583,"prevInTime":74569,"nextInTime":74571,"topicId":74563,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I think the posted age limits on playground equipment are a new thing.

I think that was the whole point of that game -- he didn&#39;t want me anywhere near him until he decided he was &quot;stuck.&quot; I think he could&#39;ve gotten himself down just fine, and once Mommy-rescues got boring, he did.</div><div><br></div><div>Can you help your son figure out some strategies for getting safely down? Maybe dangling his legs and hanging would put him safely within your reach? Practice on a piece of equipment that&#39;s lower and less intimidating.
