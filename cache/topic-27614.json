Pre-unschooling. :)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; But gosh,, the joy that comes from that show.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Here&#39;s some reasons why Kyra (ds9) loves Spongebob:<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; 1.  He&#39;s always happy.<br/>\n&gt; 2.  I learned what a goober was.  (She knew what goober was when playing<br/>\n&gt; Balderdash :D and a lot of adults didn&#39;t ;) (so its educational,,if that<br/>\n&gt; matters &lt;g&gt;  And that&#39;s from the Spongebob movie.  She says its a peanut, by<br/>\n&gt; the way.)<br/>\n&gt; 3.  His songs are awesome.  (We had to order a cd from the show.  And she got<br/>\n&gt; up at the Live and Learn conference and sang one. :D)<br/>\n&gt; 4.  His pet Gary always goes &quot;meow&quot;, who is a snail.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I think if you can see the happiness and pleasure that comes to your child<br/>\n&gt; from these things, (shows/movies/games/music,or insert anything else that<br/>\n&gt; parents don&#39;t like), it can in turn wash over those feelings of discomfort or<br/>\n&gt; annoyance. <br/>\n&gt; And it can bring a great joy to you too.  Its awesome. :)<br/>\n&gt;  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;   Kelli~<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;    <br/>\n&gt;   <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/\">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/</a>  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; &quot;Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one&#39;s courage.&quot;  ~Anais Nin<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt;  __________________________________________________<br/>\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?<br/>\n&gt; Tired of spam?

If it&#39;s not familiar to you so you shun it.  I noticed I had been doing that with my son and his games. So I have tried get more involved in my son interests. We all got game boy advances and my son insisted we all get the same fire red version Pokee&#39;mon game so we can trade and link up. Despite my resistance at first, and to my surprise, I&#39;m having loads of fun playing the game and collecting all the creatures.  I just collected a rare Snorlax and was jumping and squealing like a little girl when I caught it. My DH and son had lost their opportunity to catch one so it was a huge deal.  My son caught me a Ponyta and traded it to me and I caught a Pokemon and am raising it in the day care to trade to my son later when it levels up to a higher level.  I told him he can borrow my Snorlax sense he doesn&#39;t have one and he can never catch one. He was so thrilled to have us as a buddy on the game.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAny way we were at bowling last week and I was talking to this other little boy and I told him about my rare catch of the Snorlax and he was so surprised that I had a game boy let alone was playing a Pokemon game.  I had to bring out my game to prove it. We stated talking game strategy and I told him how I finally caught my Snorlax and he was like wow!!! that was good strategy. Then he said something that was really surprising. He told me how wonderful it was to talk to me because us old parents hardly ever make attempt to learn or like what they, the kids  are interested in. He said how cool it was that I was playing a &quot;kids game&quot; and how he wished more parents and old people would do that.   Yes we&#39;re old people to them UGH...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some of the new games I just can&#39;t play or watch at all.  I actually get vertigo watching them, nauseous and very sick. UGH some are just awful . I had started rejecting them and refused to be around them at all with my son. It really started showing the disconnect between us. I had to find a way to be involved and understand the game strategy with out playing and watching the games.  I then showed him how to google game cheat codes and figure out how to reach different levels and different sections. He always on my computer printing off game stuff and reading up about the games. And because I have found other ways to be involved he now knows I was not just ignoring his interests but that I have a reason for not playing most of the games he loves.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it looked like I just hated all games. He felt bad,  he wanted to share all this exciting info and game stuff with me but didn&#39;t as he thought I would be negative and put it down. He was unhappy because he felt he couldn&#39;t talk to me about a very important part of his life,  his games.  I know this because my wise little boy told me so.  That&#39;s when I realized I had been sending him the wrong message.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow we have one or two games we can play.  I still have our very first Nintendo game station and I pulled out the first Zelda game and the first Mario bro. game. Now those I can play.  I may not be able to play all the games but I can ask him if he got to the next level or if he found the item he was looking for or what ever it is. And I can  learn as much about the game as possible.  He knows  that I know the names of the characters and the goals of the game and we talk to each other about the games.  He&#39;s not trying to hide or keep to himself something that is important to him. He knows he can come to me about anything. It saddened me that he was unhappy thinking I disapproved of something he really enjoyed, that some how this disapproval was how I felt about him too. That&#39;s how he was seeing it. I hope he now knows different.

I had mentioned to Seamus previously, about a <br/>\nmovie called &quot;Baby&quot; about a dinosaur some scientists find in the <br/>\nrain forest or something. Early to mid 80s, really bad special <br/>\neffects compared to the post-&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; era. So when i found it <br/>\nin this box, we played it, and i said &quot;Oh there&#39;s William Katt!&quot; and <br/>\nstarted singing The Greatest American Hero theme song. It was HUGE <br/>\nat the time of the (short lived)TV show, but of course Seamus didnt <br/>\nrecognize it. We have the series coming on Netflix too...i was <br/>\nlooking for info on &quot;V&quot; (the miniseries and tv show from &#39;83-&#39;85)on <br/>\nIMDB (talk about connections....everything is connected there! <br/>\nwow...)and was led to different pages for all the shows of my <br/>\nchildhood. There was a show i really wanted to get from Netflix <br/>\ncalled Voyagers! that isnt available, about a boy who&#39;s dad is a <br/>\nhistory professor, the kid gets basically stuck travelling through <br/>\ntime with this &quot;Voyager&quot; guy. And because the kid knows alot about <br/>\nhistory, and the Voyager doesnt, the kid is helpful. Incidentally, <br/>\nthe kid actor is Meeno Peluce, who is the half brother of Soleil <br/>\nMoon Fry who was &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. I read the Peluce is now a <br/>\nteacher at Hollywood High...or something like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe watched the entire &quot;V&quot; series including the two mini-series and <br/>\nall the tv show episodes, and had a bunch of interesting <br/>\nconversations about special effects, clothing, music...not to <br/>\nmention about how a perfectly entertaining miniseries can degerate <br/>\nto the point of being almost ridiculous and unwatchable by the last <br/>\nepisode. We talked about the really successful and famous actors who <br/>\nwere on V early in their careers (like Michael Ironside and Robert <br/>\nEnglund)...on and on. Plus it was really fun to watch together. If <br/>\nGreatest American Hero is painful to watch, i have no problem <br/>\nsending it right back, which is the great thing about Netflix, no <br/>\ncommitment. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, i&#39;m just so amazed when people complain about tv. We love <br/>\ntv. Lots and Lots. My son has been watching Naruto online, i think <br/>\nhe&#39;s watched 200 episodes or something, all thats available on <br/>\nYouTube. I LOVE that he loves it. I think its GREAT when kids are so <br/>\npassionate about something, i don&#39;t care what it is. In fact, i <br/>\nthink i need to at least watch a couple of episodes of Naruto since <br/>\ni don&#39;t know anything about it, and if he likes it so much there is <br/>\nprobably *something* about it i will enjoy. I&#39;d like to be able to <br/>\nhave a conversation about the characters and plotlines and not be <br/>\nlost. <br/>\n<br/>\nA mother on a non-HSing list i&#39;m on was complaining about her son <br/>\nstaying up late watching Naruto.

She says its a peanut, by the way.)<br/>\n3.  His songs are awesome.  (We had to order a cd from the show.  And she got up at the Live and Learn conference and sang one. :D)<br/>\n4.  His pet Gary always goes &quot;meow&quot;, who is a snail.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you can see the happiness and pleasure that comes to your child from these things, (shows/movies/games/music,or insert anything else that parents don&#39;t like), it can in turn wash over those feelings of discomfort or annoyance. <br/>\nAnd it can bring a great joy to you too.

Since we don&#39;t  <br/>\nride in the car so much together anymore, I don&#39;t get to share  <br/>\ndirectly.   A couple of times I&#39;ve been curious enough about the song  <br/>\nto come home and ask him more.  Once he showed me the video of one of  <br/>\nthem, online.  The singer had died recently, and he knew the details  <br/>\nof that.  (A female, so some of you might know; it was about a baby.   <br/>\nI&#39;d ask him, but he&#39;s asleep.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the second Live and Learn conference, at the end of the talent  <br/>\nshow, Bob Wilkinson started singing the Spongebob Squarepants  <br/>\nthemesong and the whole room exploded in happy sing-along.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nknow it because my kids are older and we don&#39;t have cable, but Marty  <br/>\n(who was 14 that year) knew it from being at other people&#39;s houses or  <br/>\nhearing it somewhere.  Holly (who wasn&#39;t there) knew it from hanging  <br/>\nout with neighbors.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably some adults thought they were dumb in the 60&#39;s, but Keith  <br/>\nand I were singing old TV themesongs for Holly a few weeks ago, and  <br/>\nit turns out Keith remembered the whole song from F-Troop,which was a  <br/>\npretty cool song (a little like Super Chicken, which we also sang for  <br/>\nher), but she knows some of those because we have a CD of TV theme  <br/>\nsongs.    Because Holly was so patient and attentive as we sang songs  <br/>\nfrom shows she hadn&#39;t seen, for Christmas I found her a CD of more  <br/>\nrecent TV themesongs.  Many of them are just little instrumental bits  <br/>\nbecause themesongs aren&#39;t generally as cool (or as long!) as they  <br/>\nused to be; commercials are worth a lot more money now.   She was  <br/>\nreally happy with it and told me later some of the best things that  <br/>\nwere there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I&#39;m saying try to see the bigger picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":77070457,"authorName":"Sanguinegirl83@aol.com","from":"Sanguinegirl83@...","profile":"sanguinegirl83","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"[AlwaysLearning] Watching enough WITH him?

From completely  controlling what <br/>\nmy oldest watched when he was young AND previewing every moment  of everything <br/>\nhe watched to letting go of my last hold out: Spongebob Square  Pants. Even <br/>\nthough I couldn&#39;t honestly say I like the show (I used to say I  hated it), I <br/>\ndo watch with Wyl some times, but on the days there are 2 or more  hour <br/>\nmarathons, I just can&#39;t bring myself to watch it all with him-even while  doing <br/>\nsomething else while we watch.  Is there just a further step to this  and I haven&#39;t <br/>\nreached the point yet where I can watch it for hours? I don&#39;t  control his <br/>\nviewing any more. When I get to a point that it is just too much for  me, I <br/>\neither go find something else to do or ask if we can watch something  else-usually <br/>\noffering to record it for him to watch at another time. I can  sometimes <br/>\npartially tune it out while I&#39;m in the room but my ability here is  limited, and <br/>\nthe theme song is too much for me. This particular  show is just one of those <br/>\nthings that provokes such a strong reaction in me  that it behooves me to delve <br/>\nmore deeply into the whys and wherefores of it all,  and I often get good <br/>\nguidance from more experienced unschoolers on &quot;strong  reaction&quot; themes like this <br/>\n(for me).  <br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\nSang<br/>\n<br/>\nWyl 4/99 and Storm  10/04<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":27675,"nextTopicId":27693}}
