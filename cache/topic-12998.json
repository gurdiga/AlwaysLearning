They get up and play with horses. They build paddocks for their horses with Lego, they make stirrups and reins and ride each other, they look at horse books and ask me to read horse books to them. They draw horses and print out horse pictures from the computer. They know the names of all the different kinds of horses (I was amazed there are so many) and when we are out they are always on the look out for horses. When we see a horse they can name it (that&#39;s a chestnut filly, a leopard spotted appaloosa stallion). They occasionally get to have a horse riding lesson when staying with an unschooled friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe all know so much more about horses!<br/>\n<br/>\nKerrin. <br/>\n  A typical day for us involves trains.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":140749869,"authorName":"wildcraft@speakeasy.net","from":"wildcraft@...","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Typical day","postDate":"1047974799","msgId":13003,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDMwMzE4MDgwNjM5LjgyODQucW1haWxAd2VibWFpbC5zcGVha2Vhc3kubmV0Pg=="},"prevInTopic":12998,"nextInTopic":13018,"prevInTime":13002,"nextInTime":13004,"topicId":12998,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I love this!
