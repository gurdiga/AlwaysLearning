I&#39;m sure it was obvious to him that what he had done was wrong when you asked him about it. In my experience, the best way to avoid these types of things is to not ask a question you already know the answer to. You already knew he made the holes. An alternative would have been to say &quot;I know you love hammering, but don&#39;t want holes in my [whatever it was]...let&#39;s find something else to hammer&quot;. It tells him you are unhappy with the holes, without implying there&#39;s something wrong with him and the results in you helping him find a less damaging outlet for his interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really a hard habit to break, but I&#39;d really encourage you not to &quot;set up&quot;/provide an opportunity to lie. There are many times in interactions with our kids where you can think about how you&#39;d treat a friend who goofed up or made a mistake. Asking her a question you already know the answer to would be condescending and a bit passive aggressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere&#39;s an alternative:<br/>\nJust observe the error and make a brief observational comment about it: &quot;I see holes hammered in my table - I don&#39;t want holes in my table&quot;<br/>\nValidate: &quot;I know you love hammering&quot;<br/>\nProvide a solution yourself, or in collaboration if the child is able: &quot;let&#39;s go find some scrap wood for you to make holes in&quot;<br/>\nGive the child ( if old/capable enough) an opportunity to try to fix the problem by either asking for ideas to fix it or to let them participate in a solution you know of: &quot;we can go to the store to look for wood filler to fix the holes and you can help me fix this if you want&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m pretty sure I got this framework from the book &quot;how to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk&quot;.

Or whatever he&#39;s using. Make the  <br/>\n&gt; environment safe to explore. (Safe for him. Safe for walls.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Second I&#39;d be more present. (In other words, expect things to happen  <br/>\n&gt; if he&#39;s alone. Don&#39;t expect rules or &quot;telling&quot; him about what&#39;s right  <br/>\n&gt; and wrong to control him. Until he can do it himself, it&#39;s your  <br/>\n&gt; responsibility to keep him and the house safe.)<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Third, if this is an ongoing interest rather than a one time thing,  <br/>\n&gt; I&#39;d find things he *can* hammer. See the holes in the wall as his way  <br/>\n&gt; of exploring something that interested him. If you stop him, that  <br/>\n&gt; interest doesn&#39;t go away. And if you&#39;ve said &quot;Don&#39;t hammer walls,&quot; you  <br/>\n&gt; haven&#39;t said, &quot;Don&#39;t hammer floors. Don&#39;t hammer wall tiles. Don&#39;t  <br/>\n&gt; hammer the cat.

Redirecting a  <br/>\nchild to something that is okay is feedback too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think where you might be getting stuck is that in conventional  <br/>\nparenting thinking, telling a child is a way of fixing their wrongness  <br/>\nso they won&#39;t do it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I&#39;d put the hammer away. Or whatever he&#39;s using. Make the  <br/>\nenvironment safe to explore. (Safe for him. Safe for walls.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond I&#39;d be more present. (In other words, expect things to happen  <br/>\nif he&#39;s alone. Don&#39;t expect rules or &quot;telling&quot; him about what&#39;s right  <br/>\nand wrong to control him. Until he can do it himself, it&#39;s your  <br/>\nresponsibility to keep him and the house safe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, if this is an ongoing interest rather than a one time thing,  <br/>\nI&#39;d find things he *can* hammer. See the holes in the wall as his way  <br/>\nof exploring something that interested him. If you stop him, that  <br/>\ninterest doesn&#39;t go away. And if you&#39;ve said &quot;Don&#39;t hammer walls,&quot; you  <br/>\nhaven&#39;t said, &quot;Don&#39;t hammer floors. Don&#39;t hammer wall tiles. Don&#39;t  <br/>\nhammer the cat.
