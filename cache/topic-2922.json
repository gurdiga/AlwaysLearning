Fortunately his registrar was a nice man who examined<br/>\nme, said it was probably a fibroadenoma and sent me for an ultrasound<br/>\nexam. This was another 3 months later.<br/>\nDuring that time I became a Reiki practitioner and started to study<br/>\nhomeopathy.<br/>\nIt was a FA but what kept me going through those months, apart from my<br/>\nkids was the positive way I took control of my own health, removed<br/>\nanything from my body that would poison it, and prevent it&#39;s own healing<br/>\nmachanisms from working.<br/>\nI did get depressed at times, especially with the long waits, not<br/>\nbecause I&#39;m afriad of dying, but because I didn&#39;;t want to leave my<br/>\nkids.<br/>\nAnyway, I hope that things go well for you.
