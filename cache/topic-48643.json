How rude and annoying.  &gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>\n <br/>\n <br/>\nA couple of days ago a friend stopped by with her 4yo son. He found some<br/>\nswords and my 5yo battled with him. She loudly asked her son &quot;What type of<br/>\nswords are those?&quot; and they both knew but didn&#39;t answer. She tried again,<br/>\n&quot;Who might use a sword like that?&quot; No response. She answered her own<br/>\nquestion, &quot;Maybe a knight or a pirate might use a sword like that?&quot; By then<br/>\nthe kids are playing with something else and completely ignoring her! She<br/>\nkilled their interest in the swords!!!<br/>\n <br/>\nShould I mention that my friend is a teacher? That explains her inherant<br/>\nneed to &quot;teach&quot; them something. (I&#39;m sure I&quot;ve done stuff like that, but<br/>\nless and less as time goes on. Now I&#39;m aware of when other people do it.)<br/>\n <br/>\nIt was insulting. Hello, my son knew about knights and swords when he was 3.<br/>\nHe specifically wanted to be a Knight for Halloween. He already had a<br/>\nhelmet, sword, and shield, and when he expressed a desire for a more<br/>\ncomplete ensemble we went shopping and found a costume to wear with it. He<br/>\nalso had a horse on a stick he would ride and a dragon costume I wore a few<br/>\ntimes so he could slay me (it was easier to put the dragon head on a 2nd<br/>\nhorse on a stick and have him attack that!). <br/>\n <br/>\nRecently I observed a mom in a music class trying to give her daughter the<br/>\nanswers! I was struck with the thought that if you have to TELL a kid what<br/>\nthey are hearing, maybe the class isn&#39;t working for that kid. We were<br/>\nsitting in the waiting area, on the other side of a 3ft dividing wall, most<br/>\nof us reading books. The kids were dancing around the room listening to<br/>\nmusic and the teacher asked what instruments they could hear in the song.<br/>\nSome kids were guessing or identifiying flutes, triangle, cymbols, and this<br/>\nmom&#39;s DD hadn&#39;t said anything yet so she was calling at her and waving over<br/>\nthe wall making the motions of hands playing the piano. Her DD didn&#39;t get<br/>\nit. She got more dramatic with her hands! Some other kid guessed piano (who<br/>\nwasn&#39;t even looking at her) and she was SO MAD!!! She almost snapped at her<br/>\nDD for not getting her clue!<br/>\n <br/>\nI think I could have been that kind of mom. If I hadn&#39;t read Dr Sears&#39; The<br/>\nBaby Book and latched (haha) onto attachment parenting and really felt good<br/>\nabout it and had that lead me to reading all sorts of other things about<br/>\nrespecting children. And eventually to Unschooling. I am so glad I am not<br/>\nthat kind of parent. I am drifting further and further away from that every<br/>\nday by reading and putting to practice what I&#39;ve been reading.<br/>\n <br/>\nKim Zerbe in Oregon<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":141316284,"authorName":"Pam Sorooshian","from":"Pam Sorooshian &lt;pamsoroosh@...&gt;","profile":"psoroosh","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Quit Unschooling?","postDate":"1258517753","msgId":48688,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRCMDM3NEY5LjgwMDAwMDhAbWFjLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDY1MzUxNC4zMTE0Ni5xbUB3ZWIxMTA0MTIubWFpbC5ncTEueWFob28uY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGhkdjhkMitocGs2QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8QjQyRDlBNEMtODFGQi00RjNCLUI4OUEtMzA4QjQ0MjFEN0NBQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8MTc1MDA0LjU2MDU4LnFtQHdlYjExMTIxNS5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+IDw2NTM1MTQuMzExNDYucW1Ad2ViMTEwNDEyLm1haWwuZ3ExLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":48687,"nextInTopic":48689,"prevInTime":48687,"nextInTime":48689,"topicId":48643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

The state of New Mexico, for  <br/>\nexample, wants 180 days of school, with several subjects.   At my  <br/>\nhouse kids have learned way more than 180 days a year, and many more  <br/>\nsubjects.  But what if my kids were not having 180 good unschooling  <br/>\ndays a year?  What if I was hiding out 75% of the time, and they only  <br/>\nhad maybe 90 good days a year?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat if I had an emotionally detrimental condition?  I get depressed  <br/>\nevery few years, every three or five (hard to say).  It would be more,  <br/>\nbut I&#39;m pretty good at managing my moods and emotions.  Sometimes I  <br/>\ncan&#39;t.  This season I took prozac (I&#39;m still taking it) because I knew  <br/>\nthat the trip to England and the Monkey Platter Festival and the Santa  <br/>\nFe Symposium were unlikely to come off in an ideal world.  And sure  <br/>\nenough, Holly moved, and then came back, and is now going to Europe  <br/>\nand will miss Christmas.  I had leg damage and was incapacitated for  <br/>\nnearly a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although usually in my life I&#39;ve only take Prozac for a month or  <br/>\ntwo to get up out of a debilitating depression (four or five times  <br/>\nover 20 years), this time I went to the counsellor in Spring, laid out  <br/>\nmy schedule for the rest of the year, told her how I was feeling and  <br/>\nwhat my concerns were, and asked if she knew any clinical findings  <br/>\nthat would make it dangerous to take an anti-depressant (Prozac  <br/>\nparticularly) for several months running.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course there are people who are on anti-depressants without even  <br/>\ngoing to counselling.  Not good.  That&#39;s not me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t intend to stay on Prozac always.  In January if I&#39;m &quot;up&quot; and  <br/>\nenergetic, I&#39;ll ease off and maybe never take any again.  Or maybe  <br/>\nsomeday something overwhelming will happen and I won&#39;t be able to  <br/>\nbreathe and sing my way up and out of my mood.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were unwilling or unable to go to a counsellor and consider  <br/>\ntaking anti-depressants and if I had no idea how to cheer myself up  <br/>\nand onward, and if I chose to say &quot;I have depression, so...&quot; then  <br/>\nmaybe it would be better for me to have put my kids in school when  <br/>\nHolly was two or three and I had a depressive episode so big that  <br/>\nstrangers pointed it out to me because of some things I had written.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether or not anyone has any diagnosed &quot;problem&quot; or condition, it&#39;s  <br/>\neasy to get in a funk or in a defensive emotional position where one  <br/>\nfeels justified in being sad or angry or tries to sleep it off with  <br/>\nnaps and maybe sleep aids.   It&#39;s bad for the mother of a baby or  <br/>\ntoddler to take sleeping pills, generally speaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyone with a serious need to consider whether moods are preventing  <br/>\nan even-keeled unschooling journey, please read this, slowly, not  <br/>\nnecessarily all in one sitting.

But I have a nearly-12yo boy with moderate autism too. I&#39;m a single parent with no family around, so I have to work part-time and run the household by myself. I relate to feeling overwhelmed. :) <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My days are consumed by chores, <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is a problem. I would really recommend you look at time-management tools for homemakers, like FlyLady.net. She focuses on radically reducing your clutter to lessen your household workload, and doing chores in manageable, incremental ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; menu planning<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t plan menus. This puts ALL the food decision-making on your shoulders, which is unfair to your family and unfair to you. And it never works out the way you plan anyway, am I right?<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, use a list of stuff your family likes to eat as a grocery shopping list. We have a dry-erase list of &quot;here&#39;s what we can eat based on what we have in the house&quot; on the fridge. My kid then tells me what he wants that day, and that&#39;s what we have. It&#39;s literally a no-brainer. It takes no thought or effort whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; cooking<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Will your daughters help with that? Most kids love the kitchen. Don&#39;t say, &quot;Do you want to help me cook?&quot; Make a game of it. &quot;Who is going to be Mom&#39;s helpers in making yummy brownies today??&quot; My kid has his own apron, he loves it that much. *g*<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; and laundry, laundry, laundry.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I realize there are 3 times as many people in your household as mine. But if you&#39;re doing &quot;laundry, laundry, laundry,&quot; all day, every day, chances are AWESOME that you *have too many clothes* (and probably linens). <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m completely serious. If you have fewer clothes to wash, then you don&#39;t get the monstrous backlogs of laundry to do. Once I cut our closets&#39; contents down to size, we now only do 4 loads of laundry a week now. With a family of 6, that works out to about 2 loads a day - not a crazy amount. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;They also dont seem to have any interests that they follow. <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>But they do. They love ponies and dolls. Those are both vast interests! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou don&#39;t have to be creative; you just have to play with them. Do you play Barbies and My Little Pony with them? There are TONS of printables, crafts and coloring pages based on these 2 subjects alone, btw. Do you watch their shows and make organic, engaging conversation based on what you&#39;re watching? Do you hang out outdoors with them? Do you take nature walks with them? Do you actively put interesting things in their path to discover? Don&#39;t ask, just put it out there for them and make conversation about what it is. It&#39;ll be hit or miss, but you&#39;ll have some hits. <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; My 4 year old told me she wants to<br/>\n&gt; go to school and my 7 year old agrees.  <br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>When kids say this, they don&#39;t always mean they want to go to school; they say it out of frustration and resentment. School is a tangible alternative to them, but it isn&#39;t the only one.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou wouldn&#39;t drive your kids to the middle of a giant forest, drop them off, say &quot;The forest is AWESOME, trust me, there&#39;s a bunch of fun stuff to do and cool things to see here, ok, bye!&quot; and drive off. But if you don&#39;t actively participate in their day-to-day lives, that is the equivalent. Your kids need you to open up constant opportunities for them to discover what they&#39;re passionate about. Being left to play My Little Pony or watch TV all day by defaut while a resentful stressed out mom nurses the baby and does 2723795 piles of laundry won&#39;t help them do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope some of the things I&#39;ve said have been helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nAndrea in Miami</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Quit Unschooling?","postDate":"1258479284","msgId":48666,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDI3QkQ3NzI2LTVBMjUtNDEzMC1CQUI1LUQ4MEI4NDREM0FEQUBTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDQwNDA1NjY3QTVBQjRDQzc5RkM5RTFCMUUwRkU1MkQ3QFJvYnluUEM+","referencesHeader":"PDZCMkIzQkNDQzIxQjQwQkU4RTREMzIxQkJCMzI3NkM3QEZBTUlMWT4gPDQwNDA1NjY3QTVBQjRDQzc5RkM5RTFCMUUwRkU1MkQ3QFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":48663,"nextInTopic":48671,"prevInTime":48663,"nextInTime":48667,"topicId":48643,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-But if every time you respond to I m bored with a job to be done, they will stop trusting you with their emotions.-=- http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore I","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1443692137\">-=-But if every time you<br/>\nrespond to &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; with a job to be done, they will stop trusting  <br/>\nyou<br/>\nwith their emotions.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore\">http://sandradodd.com/BoredNoMore</a><br/>\nI think Robyn&#39;s very deeply right.

The challenge is with what we replace schooling in our homes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I understand what you mean when you want to say &quot;we are unschooling <br/>\nand our kids are in school&quot;. I think you mean that you are still following <br/>\nunschooling principles in your parenting and lifestyle. That your kids will <br/>\nhave the choice to leave school freely if and when it ceases to fulfil their <br/>\nneeds as they define them. That those hoops that school places in your life <br/>\nare worth whatever of value is gained from being in school for those kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut again *technically* when all the family&#39;s children are enrolled in <br/>\nschool they are no longer home schooling, so they are no longer unschooling. <br/>\nThey *are* doing school on a daily basis. Perhaps they are bringing school <br/>\nhome. Presumably once any or all of them leave school (while still school <br/>\nage) they could easily slide right back into unschooling, and be doing so <br/>\ntechnically again.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s a question of muddying the definition. If the term &quot;unschooling&quot; is <br/>\nused to mean nothing more than an attitude to life, regardless of the <br/>\nlegality of the definition or the actions entailed in it, then we are <br/>\ngetting into the fuzzy area where people might consider themselves to be <br/>\nunschooling after school and on the weekends. This doesn&#39;t work for the <br/>\npurposes of discussing unschooling on this list.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people express that they would be unschoolers at heart if they had the <br/>\ncourage/money/energy/whatever to take their kids out of school. This is also <br/>\nin the area of the &quot;unschooling from birth&quot; concept, although a lot of us <br/>\nargue strongly that *technically* until the child is school age they are not <br/>\nofficially unschooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling is a whole lifestyle. It does encompass a set of actions that <br/>\npromote natural learning, free expression, self-knowledge, passion and <br/>\ninterest based living, and a method of parenting that holds respect for the <br/>\nchild as a whole person and the child&#39;s needs at it&#39;s heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany of these ideas can exist in conjunction with schooling - especially if <br/>\nthe child happens to have a natural learning style that fits with school and <br/>\nhappens to have interests that  parallel the school curriculum. I applaud <br/>\nparents willing to do the hard extra work to keep holding these principles <br/>\nat the center of their family despite the overwhelming nature of schooly <br/>\nculture, which tends to permeate the thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever this list doesn&#39;t exist to help people be happier with school choice <br/>\nexcept in passing. It is not here to support people going to school who want <br/>\nto keep the label unschooler.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an aquaintance who really wants to home school and be a mindful <br/>\nparent. She continues to call herself a home schooler at heart. She <br/>\ncontinues to want to use home schoolers as a resource for herself, like <br/>\nbabysitters after school hours or for parenting advice. Meanwhile her dd is <br/>\nin school, her son with autism is in so many school based programs I can&#39;t <br/>\nkeep track (and she is nearly swamped herself), and her two littler ones are <br/>\nin a co-op nursery school. But as far as I can tell, she is the only person <br/>\nwho is unhappy with her dd&#39;s school - the dd seems perfectly happy with her <br/>\nschool friends and school activities. The mom is also unable at this time to <br/>\nmake home better than school for her friend because of the overwhelming <br/>\nattention and time her son needs, from her pov.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, her conversation is all about school issues. That&#39;s what <br/>\nhappens when kids are in school. It takes over everything - unless you make <br/>\na concious effort to hold it back like endlessly weeding. Like I said, if <br/>\nyou are accomplishing that, good for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think it will be helping the OP, <br/>\nwho is clearly in a lot of pain, to be telling her &quot;put them in school, it&#39;s <br/>\nstill unschooling&quot;, when she is clearly struggling with gaining a deep <br/>\nunderstanding of what flourishing unschooling requires of us as parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

You said, &quot;My days are consumed by chores, menu planning, cooking, breastfeeding, budgeting, breaking up fights and laundry, laundry, laundry.&quot; If your girls are bored and you have all of these chores to do then you need to put your girls to work! Teach them about nutrition by having them help you plan meals. Look through weekly sales flyers and clip coupons with them. Have them bring a calculator to the store and keep a tally of the cost of items placed in the basket, discuss which sales are better and why, etc. Buy the book, &quot;Science in the Supermarket&quot; to learn more and do experiments with items from the store. Get the girls cooking with you. Where does our food come from? They can learn a lot by helping measure ingredients, following a recipe and learning about different cooking techniques (how does a microwave work?). Breastfeeding is an awesome way to teach young girls about their bodies. Show charts on Anatomy and how boys and girls are different. Learn about animals who have babies and breast feed six or more! That is a great time to plop your feet up and read them a book or have them read to you...or the baby! Budgeting is a great way to teach math and money. Why not offer the girls an allowance and have them keep a notebook on how they spend. Have them open a savings account. Look at a pay stub and discuss taxes, etc. Have them write out the checks and make a calendar of when bills are due. Breaking up fights can also be a learning experience. Have them role play each other and discuss how everyone thinks or acts different (psychology). And laundry can be made into lessons also. Why not make your own laundry soap? When you fold laundry talk about fractions like &quot;in half&quot; etc. Discuss how soap works and about different materials. Have them look up where their clothes come from (Made in Taiwan). Read about the inventor of the washing machine, the borax mule team in California and so on. Even day to day experiences can be turned into learning opportunities because children are ALWAYS LEARNING! <br/>\n<br/>\n- Kris in Florida<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":287815876,"authorName":"Robyn L.

Some children enjoy quiet reading and projects, but the underlying <br/>\nparagdigm of the vision you have sketched sounds a lot like separation to <br/>\nme. They are off doing and then come and report to you - that is <br/>\nfundamentally the same as what happens in a schooling family, just in a <br/>\ndifferent location.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to suggest that you take a few deep breaths. It&#39;s tough to make <br/>\nemotional decisions when you have a newborn with all those hormonal emotions <br/>\nflowing through you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are breaking up fights consistently then your kids are being left to <br/>\ntheir own devices too much. Unschooling means relentless attention to your <br/>\nkids - which probably sounds appalling to you right now, with all you have <br/>\nto do.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet we all have all those things to do. I have only one child, but there are <br/>\nfamilies successfully unschooling 5,6,7,8,9, even a couple of 10 kid <br/>\nfamilies including one or more special needs kids in their mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t just happen. The parents make it happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling doesn&#39;t blossom instantly either. The children and the parents <br/>\nhave to (really one of the few Have To&#39;s) deschool from their school <br/>\nexperiences. Chances are your two older girls are still in that process, and <br/>\nalmost certainly you are still in that process from what you have said about <br/>\nhow you are defining learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s look at what you have said about your daughters:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My daughters are only interested in playing barbie&#39;s, my little pony, <br/>\nwatching TV, or playing in the backyard. While I think that playing is <br/>\nwonderful, I don&#39;t really feel that they&#39;ve learned much and they often <br/>\ncomplain that they&#39;re bored and don&#39;t have any friends. They also dont seem <br/>\nto have any interests that they follow.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nLet&#39;s translate that some:<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;My daughters have strong mutual interests in barbies, my little pony, tv <br/>\nand outdoor play, which is wonderful. I suspect that they would like more of <br/>\nmy attention and interaction, and maybe to get out more an meet other kids.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I try to give them ideas when they ask me but they don&#39;t like my <br/>\nsuggestions.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m going out a limb here with my suspicion that your suggestions are most <br/>\nlikely couched in &quot;go away and do this&quot; type of ideas, rather than games or <br/>\ninteractions in which you would participate and engage with them. I suspect <br/>\nthat you are suggesting schooly looking activities to them, rather than <br/>\nspringboarding from the clearly demonstrated interests that they are already <br/>\nshowing you - but you are dismissing as &quot;not learning&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour 4yo probably has very different ideas of fun from the older girls. Is <br/>\nyou 8yo being expected to take charge of her?  My daughter is a perfect <br/>\nmirror for my emotional state, including when I am feeling put upon, <br/>\nfrustrated, overwhelmed and hopeless (rare these days). It&#39;s a great wake up <br/>\ncall to amend my attitude. Maybe your dd&#39;s are offering the same gift to <br/>\nyou.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is something else lurking under your post also that will always have a <br/>\ndeleterious effect on your unschooling, and that is some fairly damning <br/>\ncriticism of you dh. I&#39;m guessing that you have a traditional division of <br/>\nlabor in your home - perhaps you are feeling alone and abandoned - but <br/>\ncarrying around a resentment of your dh, your partner, will not make the <br/>\nweight of these other responsibilities lighter. I want to suggest that you <br/>\nactively work on finding things to appreciate about him - especially when <br/>\nyou feel the least appreciative.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, working together, you can restructure your budget to get just a <br/>\nlittle bit of mother&#39;s helper time. Even a home schooling teenager coming <br/>\nover to play with the kids can be a help - or perhaps someone doing some of <br/>\nthe laundry.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is easy to become isolated with a newborn. I would encourage you to find <br/>\nan unschooling or inclusive home schooling park day to get to with your <br/>\nkids. Arrive early, bring plenty of snacks. You will find a bunch of mostly <br/>\nwomen many of whom will have been through trying to juggle the multiple <br/>\nneeds of many kids and a newborn, and you might find just enough to interest <br/>\nyour kids to reinvigorate their lives and feelings. I especially recall <br/>\nJayn&#39;s enjoyment of park days when she was about 4 and a little younger. Now <br/>\nshe prefers playdates.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Basically I have a bunch of bored kids who don&#39;t do anything except make <br/>\nmesses and watch TV. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they are choosing tv because of a lack of other options that is a <br/>\nproblem. If they are choosing tv because they enjoy it, that is something <br/>\nelse. Jayn watches a lot of tv, plays a lot of wii and computer games, surfs <br/>\nthe internet. Quite honestly sometimes one of these activities is being <br/>\nchosen because of the lack of other stuff to do - to help pass some time <br/>\nwhile I finish up some work or in the middle of the night. But this is not <br/>\nthe norm - usually Jayn is very happy to watch tv, making concious choices <br/>\nabout her programming. She still likes a certain amount of repetition also.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be a lot happier and more compassionate if you can move away from <br/>\njudging their important learning activities (ie all their play) as &quot;making <br/>\nmesses&quot;.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you find a way to do more than just tolerate (&quot;live with that&quot;) their <br/>\nchoices, but instead discover and celebrate the real learning going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever else happens, all the other interests, other people, other <br/>\nactivities in the world are not going to make unschooling blossom in the <br/>\nabsence of your attention and focus - even if it means watching their tv <br/>\nshows with them while you fold the laundry, and laughing when they want to <br/>\nclimb under the pile of clean towels fresh and toasty from the dryer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps others will have some more practical suggestions for you. In the <br/>\nmean time the only thing that I am sure of is that it is my attitude that <br/>\nmakes the greatest difference to my happiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRobyn L.

My 7 year old has moderate/severe Autism.  I have a husband who&#39;s not really involved, hardly any extra money, and severely lacking in the creativity department. My days are consumed by chores, menu planning, cooking, breastfeeding, budgeting, breaking up fights and laundry, laundry, laundry.  Some days I don&#39;t even get to sit down unless I&#39;m nursing the baby.  I have been trying to unschool for a year and a half and I really don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s working out.  My daughters are only interested in playing barbie&#39;s, my little pony, watching TV, or playing in the backyard.  While I think that playing is wonderful, I don&#39;t really feel that they&#39;ve learned much and they often complain that they&#39;re bored and don&#39;t have any friends.  They also dont seem to have any interests that they follow. I try to give them ideas when they ask me but they don&#39;t like my suggestions. My 4 year old told me she wants to<br/>\n go to school and my 7 year old agrees.  It was so hard not to cry when they said that.  I think unschooling is the most wonderful idea in the whole world and I really wanted my kids to think so too.  When I first read about unschooling I had envisioned my children quitely reading a book or doing projects in their room, and then telling me everything they learned or just talking to me about what they&#39;re interested in, but it&#39;s been nothing like that at all. My mother tells me to send them back to school, but that&#39;s the last thing I want to do.  Basically I have a bunch of bored kids who don&#39;t do anything except make messes and watch TV.  I would be able to live with that if I thought they were happy....but I don&#39;t think they are.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it possible my family is not cut out for this lifestyle?<br/>\nOr have I failed to do my part some how?<br/>\nHave I misunderstood how unschooling works?<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m so broken hearted about this.....Any gentle comments would be so appreciated.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much.....Abbey<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n      <br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":48719,"nextTopicId":48740}}
