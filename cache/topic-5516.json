Obviously, it&#39;s about weather...but quite often it&#39;s about severe weather...which I think holds her ( and my) interest a little more...... I guess we&#39;re a little nerdy, but we really enjoy it. ;-)<br/>\n  Anyway ... I thought maybe I&#39;d pass that idea along...<br/>\n  Rachelle<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":5504,"nextTopicId":5519}}
