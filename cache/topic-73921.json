There are lots of ways a parent can contribute to their children&#39;s happiness, and one of those ways is to be calm and relaxed and soft.  If you, the parent, can be calm and happy, especially when your son is bored, it will do more for his peace of mind and happiness than scrambling around anxiously trying to make him happy.  Being calm and accepting of his boredom and restlessness will probably help you better see what he might actually need from you in those moments.  An anxious mind is tight and tends to run in circles.  A calm mind is soft and open and receptive, and ideas and connections are fluid and easy, even if they take time.<br/>\n<br/>\nLisa C<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":283914803,"authorName":"Jo","from":"Jo &lt;jokirby2004@...&gt;","profile":"jokirby2004","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Finding a good partnership","postDate":"1395136305","msgId":73922,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDRGRjM4MzA4LTA4QzMtNDMzQi05RkY3LUFBMjE2NDIzQTkxOUB5YWhvby5jby51az4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGxnOGg2MCsxc3UxZGQ5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGxnOGg2MCsxc3UxZGQ5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":73921,"nextInTopic":73923,"prevInTime":73921,"nextInTime":73923,"topicId":73921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I think it feels a bit like a game to him and it&#39;s very fun for me too - being so creative on the spot. I put in ideas connected to stuff he&#39;s just been doing, stuff that&#39;s completely different, ideas we&#39;ve had together in the past but not got round to yet, wacky, silly things that make him laugh.... What usually happens is that something I say either reminds him of or gives him an idea, and he&#39;s off... (on the idea/project I mean).<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe your son might like it if you offer &quot;want to do something together?&quot;<br/>\nIf he says yes but isn&#39;t sure what to do, you could suggest &quot;let&#39;s just hang out and see...&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nMore hanging out and chatting together might help your son see that ideas can come from all over the place, both internally and externally, from connections in our minds and through conversation with others, all the time really. Could he have got the message (from you maybe, or school? - not sure if he is always unschooled - in which case forget that bit!) that we wait for ideas to be given to us?, in which case backing off a bit from providing the answer, but at the same time staying with him to chat and hang out, might open up another way of creative thinking for him...<br/>\n<br/>\nWith your example of the UFO project, I could see why he lost interest, but I would also see that as a sign that he wasn&#39;t super into the idea anyway, and I wouldn&#39;t worry. It&#39;s not realistic for you to always have exactly what he wants for his projects. You can help him be creative with what you have got, if he&#39;s into it, and leave it if not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis example lead me to wonder if perhaps he was trying to justify his boredom in some way? Could he have got the message that it&#39;s not ok to be bored? It&#39;s natural for us to feel bored sometimes, it can be a creative break, or a pause for the mind. What if you&#39;ve been given the message that&#39;s not ok, that you shouldn&#39;t feel bored, but you do! How do you justify your own feelings?, perhaps by &#39;proving&#39; why you&#39;re bored....<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have any more thoughts I&#39;ll post again...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> On 18 Mar 2014, at 04:13, &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:boisei@...\">boisei@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; He still asks gwhat can I do Ifm bored?h </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":386666394,"authorName":"","from":"&lt;boisei@...&gt;","profile":"melgqd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Finding a good partnership","postDate":"1395116032","msgId":73921,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGxnOGg2MCsxc3UxZGQ5QFlhaG9vR3JvdXBzLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":73922,"prevInTime":73920,"nextInTime":73922,"topicId":73921,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"This is something that I’ve been thinking about lately because I find myself not quite knowing what I should do.
