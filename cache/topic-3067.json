Or what if you do a cyber-school<br/>\n  thing? What if you attend  a public program two half days a week, and<br/>\n  love it, and spend the rest of your time playing in the creek? I<br/>\n  certainly think the line drawn between &quot;independent&quot; homeschoolers and<br/>\n  those who utilize a charter, public ISP, or umbrella school is artificial<br/>\n  and harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  &gt; I digress, I guess I should never have spoken my mind to begin with.<br/>\n  &gt; <br/>\n  Oh, no, speaking your mind is wonderful!

I thought California was a much better state for homeschoolers,<br/>\nand especially unschoolers, than Washington.  Lots of options, and if you<br/>\nwant to take the no-interference path, you file the R-4 (set up your own<br/>\nprivate school) and file a one-page paper once a year and you&#39;re done<br/>\nwith it. No testing, no documentation, nada....<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I think it&#39;s hard to draw an exact line with a lot of these<br/>\nthings. Actually, I find it easier to define an unschooler than a<br/>\nhomeschooler - an unschooler is learning the way he choses to learn,<br/>\nwhether he&#39;s an underground homeschooler spending all his time online or<br/>\nhe&#39;s spending 8 hrs a day in a school classroom. *My* opinion. <br/>\nHomeschooling is harder to define... what if you do Calvert and send your<br/>\nlessons in to a teacher, who grades them and returns them, and the<br/>\nparents are peripherally involved?  Or what if you do a cyber-school<br/>\nthing? What if you attend  a public program two half days a week, and<br/>\nlove it, and spend the rest of your time playing in the creek? I<br/>\ncertainly think the line drawn between &quot;independent&quot; homeschoolers and<br/>\nthose who utilize a charter, public ISP, or umbrella school is artificial<br/>\nand harmful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I digress, I guess I should never have spoken my mind to begin with.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>Oh, no, speaking your mind is wonderful! I love it that people do that<br/>\nhere. You just can&#39;t expect everyone to agree with you all the time,<br/>\nthat&#39;d be do fun at all... and besides, no one would learn anything new<br/>\nthat way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDar<br/>\n________________________________________________________________<br/>\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!<br/>\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!<br/>\nJoin Juno today!
