Here are the listed speakers:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSIGMUND BROUWER IS A RENOWNED AUTHOR OF OVER 50 BOOKS. HIS BOOKS ARE ON OVER <br/>\n2,000,000 BOOKSHELVES. He is a sought after speaker in home based education <br/>\ncircles as a well as being a very popular informational and motivational <br/>\nspeaker in public circles in the US and Canada. We want to thank Sigmund for <br/>\ngiving us a special rate that has allowed us to bring him in on our limited <br/>\nconvention budget.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd is a popular speaker in the US at home based education functions. <br/>\nShe looks forward to her first time to talk with Saskatchewan home based <br/>\neducators. Sandra Dodd taught English for 6 years in New Mexico, before they <br/>\nchoose to home educate their family. None of her children have attended <br/>\npublic school. She has mastered the art of educating without rigid structure. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheryl Garrett IS COMING AS A FEATURE SPEAKER. There have been so many <br/>\nrequests for her that we have chosen to invite her for 2003 convention. She <br/>\nspecializes in classical education and organizing your home based education.<br/>\n<br/>\nHSLDA has been invited by popular request also. It is unfortunate that Dallas <br/>\nMiller cannot atttend, but he had assured us the someone from the <br/>\norganization will come to give us some of the update on home based education <br/>\nsituat can seriously effect our lives and the education of our children.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n----------------<br/>\n<br/>\nScary,  huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it turns out well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bio I sent was this:<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra Dodd has three children who have never been to school, and who have <br/>\nnever had school at home.  She and her husband, Keith, an engineer, live in <br/>\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, with Kirby (16), Marty (14) and Holly (11) and often <br/>\nhave other teens and children in the house as well, many of them also <br/>\nunschoolers or homeschoolers.    Sandra grew up in northern New Mexico.  <br/>\nAfter studying English and Psychology at the University of New Mexico, she <br/>\ntaught &quot;Language Arts&quot; and writing to young teens in her hometown of Espa√±ola <br/>\nfor several years.     Sandra is the unschooling columnist for Home Education <br/>\nMagazine, is active at their www.unschooling.com forum, and has an <br/>\nevergrowing website, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://SandraDodd.com/unschooling\">http://SandraDodd.com/unschooling</a> to which she invites <br/>\nyou even if you can&#39;t make it to her talks at this conference.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNo mention of the magazine the website...<br/>\nI never would have used the numeral &quot;6&quot; in text! <br/>\nAnd I didn&#39;t quit teaching to homeschool.  I had quit teaching years before I <br/>\nwas ever even pregnant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s not idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAND I&#39;m not invited to speak in Sacramento at the HSC conference.  Rather I&#39;m <br/>\ninvited to be on panels of my choosing, if I get there on my own and pay for <br/>\nmy own room.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe next year, on that one.  Holly&#39;s disappointed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12020,"nextTopicId":11996}}
