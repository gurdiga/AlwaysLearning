I&#39;ll response to this with more about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose quoted are Schuyler (the first quote) and Joanna:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n====================================<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-Candy fed with love beats the heck out of broccoli eaten out of  <br/>\nfear. And my kids like broccoli even in the face of a jar filled with  <br/>\ncandy and a drawer filled with snacks. Television watched as a family,  <br/>\naltogether talking about Shirley Valentine or giant squids or Sandy  <br/>\nthe Squirrel and living as an astronaut under the sea, well that&#39;s so  <br/>\namazing, it&#39;s so many kinds of connection and conversation and joy,  <br/>\nwhatever fear you live with isn&#39;t anything against the absolute  <br/>\npleasure of hanging out together that I&#39;ve got with my kids.-=-<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the heart of the matter for me--all the discussion about  <br/>\nwhether sugar is good or bad, or whether t.v. is good or bad takes the  <br/>\nfocus away from unschooling and sets my head reeling. The grounding  <br/>\nforce is the relationship with my children. And that&#39;s something that  <br/>\nhappens in the moment--in many moments. Will the moments be made of  <br/>\nfear and control, or will they be made of something more connecting,  <br/>\nwith substance and trust that they have real thinking brains?<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople want to look at these issues as though there are only two  <br/>\noptions: free reign or limit. Black or white thinking. There is a  <br/>\nwhole world of conversation and relationship with your children  <br/>\nbetween the two extremes. And that&#39;s where unschooling lives--a child  <br/>\nexploring their world in connection with a parent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you going to be a parent who enlarges your child&#39;s world and helps  <br/>\nthem to find their own power and hone their decision making and  <br/>\ncritical thinking abilities, or will you be a parent who limits and  <br/>\ncloses down your child&#39;s world and imposes your own ideas of right and  <br/>\nwrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nStand WITH your child to navigate these issues, not in their way. The  <br/>\nmore you let them make important decisions, the more they will think  <br/>\nthem through and strive to make good ones for themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoanna<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":52689,"nextTopicId":52880}}
