As Sandra said being 5 has an<br/>\nexpiration date.  We figured out AP on our own after our first was born and<br/>\nnone of my mil&#39;s advice worked very well - let them cry - from the first<br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel right.  It was harder with the twins.  Also, the younger, BG,<br/>\nhad a stricture in her esophagaus that wasn&#39;t detected until she was 15 mos.<br/>\nShe would nurse every hour to hour and a half.  She cried what seemed like<br/>\nconstantly.  My husband was at work so there was only me.  My older helped a<br/>\nlot.  She loves her little sisters.  But it was hard.  Abby, the older one,<br/>\ndidn&#39;t get the holding and cuddling that her sister did.  BG had 4 surgeries<br/>\nto correct the problem.  After that she could actually eat - what a<br/>\ndifference.  Abby sleeps with Abra (8) usually and BG sleeps with Hannah<br/>\n(16).  By morning BG&#39;s usually in my bed.  They did that around the time<br/>\nthey turned 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are so intense.  When Hannah and Rachael would fight (2 yrs apart) it<br/>\nwas never with this intensity.  Different personalities too besides the twin<br/>\nfactor.  My sil with a masters in special education tells me they hold each<br/>\nother back.  Being cognitively at the same level the pull each other down<br/>\ninstead of one pulling the other up.  She was trying to prove they needed to<br/>\nbe in pre-school.  Seems to me she shot her own theory.  Lol.  But I have to<br/>\nadmit the dynamics are completely different. <br/>\n<br/>\nJanet<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  _____  <br/>\n<br/>\nYAHOO!
