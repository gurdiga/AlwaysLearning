I would let her lead the discussion. <br/>\nI would cry my heart out over my sense of loss and I would hold her as she <br/>\nneeded, or not. She may not actually feel that sad about it. I would be fine <br/>\nwith that, as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen our dog died a few years ago mostly it was David and I who were bereft, <br/>\neven though he&#39;d been there for all of Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s memories. They&#39;ve <br/>\nseen lots of animals die as we&#39;ve attempted various rescues from our flock of <br/>\ncats. They sat with me and held one of our cats as she breathed her last <br/>\nlaboured breath. When Pickle died they were sad, but their grief was their grief <br/>\nand it wasn&#39;t mine or David&#39;s and it wasn&#39;t the sense of loss that I had <br/>\nremembering him as a puppy waiting for toddler Simon to drop a bit of food. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t know what the death of animals they have known does for shaping their <br/>\nvision of death. Reading over the webpages on pet death there is a sense that <br/>\nthis is a learning opportunity, a learning moment to be caught by the parent and <br/>\nhanded on to the child.  I think each person has a pretty personal understanding <br/>\nof death and life and I can&#39;t imagine how the death of a pet will make it easier <br/>\nto face your own mortality or the mortality of those around you. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n________________________________<br/>\nFrom: zurro &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:zurrolaur@...\">zurrolaur@...</a>&gt;<br/>\nTo: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>\nSent: Saturday, 24 September, 2011 0:53:45<br/>\nSubject: [AlwaysLearning] Talking about death (pet specifically) with an almost <br/>\n5 yo<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to get some suggestions about talking about death with Caitlyn.
