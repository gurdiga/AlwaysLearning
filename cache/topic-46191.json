Gardening practices without herbicides and pesticides are<br/>\nanother.<br/>\nI like some of the heirloom veggies for novelty. Some of them have better flavor than the new varieties but some don&#39;t . Some of the new varieties are more disease resistant. I value that when I have some disease running through my tomatoes and other vegetables. Last year my peppers did great. This year they are being hit by some fungal disease and I probably won&#39;t get any.? I won&#39;t treat with anything but if I didn&#39;t have stores to rely on and my food source was being depleted then I would want something to stop that. I found squash vine beetle on my pumpkins, squash etc. I try to find the eggs and get rid of them, but don&#39;t spray. I would be all for a variety that stopped them. I&#39;m pretty sure that some of?my plants will be wilting soon from the squash vine borers and that I won&#39;t get my pumpkins and maybe only?a few squash. My peach tree gets hits by some form of rust...I think. I know my old varieties of crabapples lose there leaves every year from cedar-apple rust. My new varieties have been resistance and maintain their leaves.<br/>\nI do love non-heirloom oranges and watermelons with no seeds. <br/>\nI don&#39;t think I could produce enough food for my family?if I only used heirloom varieties and no herbicides or pesticides. I would like to think I could but looking at my vegetable devastation every year by not doing this it makes me feel insecure about being able to provide all the food I would need. <br/>\nReferring back to Laura Ingall&#39;s books. There is one where the locus walk through eating everything in their path. That was?an amazing story to me. Locus are still a big problem in Africa. Having them come through can be a matter of life a death. <br/>\nThat being said I also just heard a NyTimes writer talking about the estrogen type compounds affect on the amphibian population but also the affect on human males....I think the quote was a 7% affect that they are seeing in human male babies not have normal descending of the testicles because of this. The estrogen type compounds apparently come from many sources...plasticizers but also herbicides and/or pesticides. Still look for the article that the reporter was referring to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother note on Little House on the Prairie.? I was an exchange student to Germany in 1983. I watched Little House on the Prairie everyday in German.

Disney absolutely ruined &#39;em...<br/>\nas stories (IMHO). As artwork?  A totally different story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that it would be interesting<br/>\nto see Disney&#39;s &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; before reading the<br/>\nclassical fairy tale.  (We read the classic version, watched<br/>\nthe Disney vesion, and watched &quot;Splash.&quot;  Everybody liked<br/>\n&quot;Splash&quot; best.)  I have to imagine, as I did it<br/>\nthe other way &#39;round.  Likewise, my kids saw &quot;Star<br/>\nWars&quot; in this order:  Episode One, then Two, and etc.,<br/>\nup through Six.  I saw Episodes Four, Five, and Six,<br/>\nthen One, Two and Three.  It creates a different experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn&#39;t know, until college, that Prince Charming<br/>\ndid quite a bit more than *kiss* the princess to <br/>\nbring her out of her deathly slumber.  It was a home run,<br/>\nbaby. Ozzy&#39;s &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nCinderella&#39;s stepsisters chopped off parts of their<br/>\nfeet, in deperation to fit into the glass slippers.<br/>\nThat doesn&#39;t show up in Disney.<br/>\n<br/>\nI leave it to parents, who are highly attuned to their<br/>\nchildren, to know if/when to suggest they read these...<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line:  if you love literature, and you love<br/>\nyour kids, there&#39;s a chance they&#39;ll at least *like*<br/>\nliterature, too.  And if they don&#39;t, as my non-native<br/>\nEnglish speakers don&#39;t, do what I do:  join them on<br/>\ntheir MMORPGs (or whatever interests them).  Stories are <br/>\neverywhere.  I let THEM introduce ME to the mythology and <br/>\nthe lore asssociated therewith, and the turnabout in roles<br/>\nbenefits all of us.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can certainly see feeling affonted by _Little House_.<br/>\nMy adoptive daugher is absolutey gorgeous, if I do say so<br/>\nmyself.  But her hair and eyes are black, and, sadly, she <br/>\nwishes for blonde hair and blue eyes, like my biological daughter has.  Shades of Mary and Laura?  Definitely.  It is hard for<br/>\nSamantha to see that Amelia and I look so alike, when she looks<br/>\ncompletely different.  That just plain HURTS.  It becomes a jumping off point for conversations.  Like the idea that kids should sit quietly in chairs, all day on Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\nHa!  That won&#39;t ever happen around here.  But it did happen, in<br/>\nLaura&#39;s life.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what?  What do my kids think about it?  That&#39;s what I care<br/>\nabout.  We go out in the sun for the few weeks it shines up here,<br/>\nand let our skin go brown, and rejoice in that.  We aren&#39;t tied<br/>\ndown by bonnets.  We go barefoot, a stolen luxury for Laura.<br/>\nBeautiful prose, _Little House_ is, and full of great conversation starters, but not a must read.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay... how about this:  Federal and state consistutions<br/>\n(or whatever applies where you live)?  Must reads?<br/>\nI still say no.

I read them again, and studied them in <br/>\ndepth, when I was obtaining my Master&#39;s degree in Library <br/>\nScience.  So, I HAVE done &quot;a little reading about these books.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nI like to compare the writing of the books written by <br/>\nRose Wilder, Laura&#39;s daughter, with the books written by <br/>\nLaura herself, namely, _The First Four Years_ and Laura&#39;s travelogue.  Yes, Laura&#39;s name appears as author on all the <br/>\nbooks, but if you compare the writing of _The First Four Years_ <br/>\nand Laura&#39;s travelogue against the rest of the series, it <br/>\nbecomes clear that they were not written by the same person.  <br/>\nRead anything Rose wrote under her own name and it becomes even <br/>\nmore obvious that Rose wrote the beloved series.  Laura may<br/>\nhave dictated, or Rose was inspired by Laura&#39;s childhood<br/>\nrecollections....<br/>\n<br/>\nWe really like these books. I have read them to all <br/>\nof my children. My kids enjoyed them, and then Netflixing <br/>\nthe TV series, and comparing/contrasting the stories, the <br/>\ncharacters, the worldview of the books, versus the TV show.<br/>\nThat said, if my adoptive children, who really have <br/>\nexperienced physical abuse, objected to the content<br/>\nand wanted me to stop reading them aloud, I would<br/>\nrespect that.  I would stop.  Even though I, personally,<br/>\nlike the books.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son, Caleb, decided to learn the fiddle tunes Pa<br/>\nplays throughout the series.  As I mentioned in an<br/>\nearlier post, we churned butter and visited maple<br/>\nfarms to see the trees being tapped, and later, the<br/>\nsap being boiled down into syrup, around the same<br/>\ntime we were reading the series.  We&#39;ve cooked<br/>\n_Little House_ recipes and made _Little House_<br/>\ncrafts.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a censor.  But a mother asked if her<br/>\nsensitive child, who happens to be of Native <br/>\nAmerican heritage, missed out by not reading<br/>\nthese books, if there were anything to be learnt<br/>\nthere that could be learned nowhere else, my<br/>\nanswer is no.  I stand by that.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, books, and TV, and movies, and life,<br/>\nwill present us with points of view and attitudes<br/>\nwe find offensive.  And we will learn from looking<br/>\nat and thinking about and discussing that which offends <br/>\nus.  But MUST the original poster&#39;s child read *these <br/>\nparticular books* in order to learn lessons that can be <br/>\nlearnt nowhere else?<br/>\n<br/>\nI say no.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, she will miss out on Rose Wilder&#39;s<br/>\nlyrical prose, e.g., how she describes Laura<br/>\nfalling to sleep, under a prairie sky full of<br/>\nstars, to the sounds of her Pa&#39;s fiddle.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I would put this series on a list of<br/>\nbooks I recommend.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don&#39;t know what book(s) are absolute<br/>\nmust reads.

I am the furthest<br/>\nthing from a censor that you can find.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s funny that you mention _Huck Finn_.  I am reading<br/>\nthat to the family right now.

They are well written and from a child&#39;s perspective most of the time.  In the first book the only times things outside Laura&#39;s sight are told as stories.  As she ages things are introduced into the storyline that she was not privy to and are not mentioned as stories...a maturing of the story telling process as the main character matures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that we shake our heads at today, but so what?  If my child has questions about something that seem strange and unusual to him, he asks and we talk about it.  I am sure when we read these books, if he wants to, he will have questions and we will talk and explore.  Will you not read/introduce Huckleberry Finn, or Gone With the Wind, or other wonderful books because what is in them is not politically correct for the current time? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Ma&#39;s reactions to Indians, remember she also was a product of her time, and it is a counterpoint to Pa&#39;s wanderlust and desires to meet them.  When Laura sees Indians, she wants to become one.  What child hasn&#39;t?  All these reactions are true to the characters, and provide an aspect to fill them out as full fictional people.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore making a decision, do a little reading about these books, this storyline, what was put in and what was left out...I had a lot of admiration for the author and editor, and the stories themselves, after I learned more about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobin Krest<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n____________________________________________________________<br/>\nCriminal Lawyers - Click here.<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2141/fc/BLSrjpTOVoL3P6G8RQzXvEqkj0RJSZsGqWbkTfcPmXImmyfEpl9gdvn5W4Q/\">http://thirdpartyoffers.juno.com/TGL2141/fc/BLSrjpTOVoL3P6G8RQzXvEqkj0RJSZsGqWbkTfcPmXImmyfEpl9gdvn5W4Q/</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":46157,"nextTopicId":46267}}
