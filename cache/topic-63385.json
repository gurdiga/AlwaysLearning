It seems to us that he may need help getting over<br/>\nthat or perhaps it is simply time? &gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinitely time. My eldest left school when he was nine, and he, and my daughter at seven, avoided things that seemed schoolish, for well over a year.<br/>\nLet him choose when to stop an activity without any judgment, even subtle non-verbal reactions, from you. Be supportive if he wants to talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Ugh. I stopped playing because the mini-game I&#39;m at was just like those worksheets I hated at school.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;Oh, that&#39;s so annoying. You&#39;d think they could come up with something more interesting!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there you guys might brainstorm some ideas of your own and have a laugh, or, if he&#39;s not in the mood for that, you could suggest another<br/>\nactivity: &quot;Want to play Monopoly with me?&quot; Or whatever he enjoys.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you know he sometimes worries about learning skills like reading etc, you might notice specific things he&#39;s learning as he&#39;s living. Not to use<br/>\nas &quot;proof&quot; in a big conversation about unschooling, but just to mention if a moment arises. If he says he&#39;s worried he won&#39;t learn to read, you might<br/>\nreply brightly &quot;I&#39;m not worried. You&#39;ve learned new words playing games, like ...&quot; adding a quick example or two you&#39;ve observed. Then move on to<br/>\nsomething else.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I wouldn&#39;t try to explain or discuss unschooling with him at any length - giving the process that kind of power can actually take away from it.<br/>\nWhat I mean is, by giving unschooling specific &quot;end product&quot; goals such as reading, you take it beyond living fully in the moment. When even a small<br/>\npart of your, or his, mind is wondering about those goals (like him thinking, &quot;Hmm, Mom says I&#39;m learning math when I play Monopoly&quot; while playing<br/>\nMonopoly) you can lose immersion in the moment - which is where the best learning is. I&#39;ve found that kind of information is best left gathered by<br/>\nlooking back on past activities (&quot;Cool, I got faster at adding numbers together while playing Monopoly.&quot;), not by projecting them into the future ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun living life together! Enjoy things he loves together, bring interesting things into his life, and follow his lead. You&#39;ll learn so much about<br/>\nhim, and he&#39;ll learn so much about himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nPam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Healing the damage of control?","postDate":"1318597508","msgId":63398,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDhCQ0QwQkQ3LThGQzUtNDM3MS04NDk4LUM2Q0IyMzMwMzY2Q0B2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDcyMEJEMzAwLUJCQzAtNDEwNS05RkFCLTMxNEFERDREQkMzM0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PGo3OTc0cythbW1sQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPiA8NzIwQkQzMDAtQkJDMC00MTA1LTlGQUItMzE0QURENERCQzMzQFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":63397,"nextInTopic":63399,"prevInTime":63397,"nextInTime":63399,"topicId":63385,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
