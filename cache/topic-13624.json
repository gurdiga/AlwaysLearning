I do agree that it is reasonable to charge for missed lessons, when the student simply doesn&#39;t turn up. I would expect some flexibilty (like you mentioned) in the case of a flood making impossible for us to get there. We did ring, and she knew we couldn&#39;t get there. She did actually offer a make-up lesson, but she was such an inappropriate teacher for Erin that she didn&#39;t want another lesson. An important point, I think, in considering this, is that she did not keep up her end of the agreement, which was to treat Erin as an adult student and to move at her pace. If she had, Erin would probably still be with her and have had the make-up lesson, there wouldn&#39;t be an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you&#39;re saying about pricing. I have good skills and provide really good service so I charge accordingly too.

That his dad was a musician, and <br/>\nthe dad in the movie had written lots of music but never became a successful <br/>\nmusician.  (Sometime I&#39;ll check and let her know.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then she asked if it was a true story that a guy was able to write music <br/>\ntotally down without using a piano or instrument.   I stopped and ran through <br/>\nstories she might be thinking of.  I said lots of people can learn to do <br/>\nthat, once they&#39;re experienced at writing it down.  I told her about <br/>\nBeethoven writing orchestral stuff after he was deaf.  She was impressed.  <br/>\nBut I told her lots of people can write music down. <br/>\n<br/>\nBefore that we had been listening to Donovan, because Holly was singing <br/>\n&quot;First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is&quot; when <br/>\nheavy clouds were covering the Sandias, then they would peek through, then <br/>\nmore clouds.  She asked who did that song and asked if it was Herman&#39;s <br/>\nHermits.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI said no, Donovan, the same guy I had mentioned the day before...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd THAT story had been told in reference to how much input a person can <br/>\nhandle at once--different people different amounts and different kinds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s hard to describe and impossible to guarantee how Cyndi Lauper and Silent <br/>\nBob can lead to a discussion of Beethoven, but it happened here today.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast night Holly wanted me to tell her the story of Hamlet.

You can get<br/>\ncheaper lessons from a college student perhaps, but you miss out on all that<br/>\nI&#39;ve learned in the last 16 years.  I do make exceptions, but you have to<br/>\nask.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the brutal, sad truth is that yes, students cancel at the last minute<br/>\nall the time and it&#39;s hard to collect the money for those lessons.  I&#39;m<br/>\npaying a babysitter, room rent sometimes, and have set aside a time, so I<br/>\ncharge for missed lessons, too.  But I do try hard to be flexible about<br/>\nthem.  That&#39;s not to defend her being inappropriate, which I think she was<br/>\nin many ways, but wanting to be paid for missed lessons is like making an<br/>\nappointment with your plummer and then not being home.  He still had to<br/>\ndrive out there, and reserved that time which could have been used for other<br/>\npeople who wanted him, so he expects to be paid anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that your daughter continues to enjoy her really cool guitar teacher,<br/>\nand that she eventually finds a piano teacher that&#39;s a lot easier to deal<br/>\nwith!  And finally, congratulations to your daughter for standing up for her<br/>\nrights!<br/>\n<br/>\nbrenda</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":90564959,"authorName":"starsuncloud@cs.com","from":"starsuncloud@...","profile":"gruvystarchild","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"music and teachers","postDate":"1050418912","msgId":13624,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDFhYS4xMzBlZWUyYy4yYmNkNzhlMEBjcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":13630,"prevInTime":13623,"nextInTime":13625,"topicId":13624,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In a message dated 4/15/03 6:00:35 AM Central Daylight Time, AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com writes: ","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1526938645\">In a message dated 4/15/03 6:00:35 AM Central Daylight Time, <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a> writes:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;&lt; I&#39;m so grateful for that guitar teacher, Erin didn&#39;t even worry about the <br/>\npiano experience because she was so musically inspired.

Yuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrevor has a guitar teacher much like the one you described.<br/>\nThe first place we called told us he couldn&#39;t play the music he liked until <br/>\nhe had &quot;the basics&quot; down. We didn&#39;t sign up.<br/>\nThe guy he is with teaches him the songs Trevor wants to learn and he&#39;s <br/>\ngetting the basics through doing what he loves. He practices every day <br/>\nwithout me ever saying a thing. He loves it.<br/>\nFunny thing is, the first guitar place we called made snooty remarks about <br/>\nthe place we ended up at. And Jerry (his teacher) has toured with many <br/>\nnotable musicians, Shania Twain among them!!! Guess they&#39;re a bit intimidated <br/>\nby a teacher that lets the kids learn what they want and is obviously a <br/>\nreally great player himself.  sheesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRen<br/>\n&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>\ngrowing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>\nmagic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>\nme....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n                                    ----Frances Hodgson Burnett</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13718,"nextTopicId":13716}}
