Sometimes it <br/>\ntakes a real effort!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n****Isn&#39;t one facet of learning to use the knowledge and experience of <br/>\ncompetence models and knowledgable people to inspire the &quot;student&quot; see more <br/>\npossibilities.

What would happen?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy experience with Jayn is that if she invents her wheel in her own way, it <br/>\nis a wheel that she intimately understands and appreciates and can use - a <br/>\nbetter wheel for her - a better way of *making* a wheel for her.

Learning and teaching are opposite sides of the coin. They balance each other out. They are one and separate (like the left and right sides of a stick; together they are the stick, you can&#39;t take one away.) In the root meaning, we all have the ability to &quot;teach&quot;. If my son wants to learn how to tie his shoes I can show him. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith regard to learning: if you take it&#39;s root as &quot;furrow&quot;, how does one make a furrow? Well, it&#39;s done with effort and repetition by oneself. When my son learns how to tie his laces, the learning comes from within himself...all I have done was offer a gift of my own learning, my own know-how. He has to &quot;dig his own furrow&quot; so to speak. When he has tied them himself, then he has &quot;mastered&quot; the technique...he&#39;s learned how.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yes, &quot;teaching a child to learn&quot; seems absurd in this respect. Learning is a &quot;doing thing&quot;, done by the &quot;doer&quot;. It&#39;s active and done by choice. And we can learn from all sorts of teachers: wind, rain, food, animals, religion, culture, art, our own emotions, experience, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one can make anyone do anything. I wholeheartedly belive this to be true. However, in our society, I would also say that &quot;forcing one to learn&quot; is true. Learning IS a choice. However, if you are in a very stressful situation, you may choose to learn how to do something at a particular time/place that you would not have if you had other choices. I also think &quot;learning under duress&quot; creates a shallow furrow....that&#39;s why most of us forgot what we &quot;learned&quot; all those years ago in our public &quot;learning&quot; institutions. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":313036834,"authorName":"strawlis","from":"&quot;strawlis&quot; &lt;lisberning@...&gt;","profile":"strawlis","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: teaching a child to learn?","postDate":"1203379512","msgId":32099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZwZDZmbysyMXZ0QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxNjkxODBGLUEwNDQtNEQ3My1BNDY1LTczNTU4QzExREY2N0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":32095,"nextInTopic":32101,"prevInTime":32098,"nextInTime":32100,"topicId":32094,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Maybe it should read like this If a child wants a fish, get him/her one If a child wants to eat fish...cook him/her one.
