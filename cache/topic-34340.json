Although I now live in a place where<br/>\nthe homeschoolers are FAR more relaxed than they were in South Dakota,<br/>\nthey&#39;re still too restrictive and disrespectful to their children for my<br/>\ncomfort. Even in the group of local &quot;unschoolers&quot; there&#39;s still an air of<br/>\n&quot;I&#39;m the grownup, that&#39;s why!&quot; that makes my hieny tingle (and not in a good<br/>\nway!).<br/>\nWe look now to the entire community as sources of support, inspiration and<br/>\ninformation -- as humans, not as unschoolers. Hayden (9.5) has made friends<br/>\nall over the place, there&#39;s no ageism in him and he&#39;s inspired adults to<br/>\ncast away their thoughts of ageism where he&#39;s concerned.

The parents, on the other hand, would like H to hang out with<br/>\ntheir sons on the scheduled group days, avoiding &quot;another&quot; trip into town to<br/>\nplay. It&#39;s a quandary Hayden&#39;s happy to avoid - he&#39;d rather hang out alone<br/>\nat home than go to gym day to see his friends.

Though I didn&#39;t meet a soul from my hometown, I made<br/>\nfriends I&#39;ll have for the rest of my life! One family my kids and I really<br/>\nconnected with lived a handful of hours from our hometown. We made a point<br/>\nto get together as often as we could afford -- now that I&#39;ve moved across<br/>\nthe country, we&#39;re working on moving them here, too :D It was an amazing<br/>\nthing to SEE my mentors with their kids, to FEEL the love and respect<br/>\nbetween them... there&#39;s really nothing like it in the world!<br/>\nFrom the Live and Learn model, there are two regional unschooling<br/>\nconferences available (Life is Good &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://lifeisgoodconference.com\">http://lifeisgoodconference.com</a>&gt; & NE<br/>\nUnschoolers &lt;<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/index.html\">http://www.northeastunschoolingconference.com/index.html</a>&gt;), and<br/>\nmany more to come as Live and Learn will be ending after this year.<br/>\nWe&#39;ve also created gatherings we like to call *non-cons* (as in, not a<br/>\nconference) where friends gather in a city and hang out for a few or many<br/>\ndays, enjoying, inspiring, playing together. (We&#39;ve been blessed with Marty<br/>\nDodd&#39;s presence at a few of them, not only is he the first unschooler my son<br/>\nmade friends with, they&#39;re honorary brothers to one another -- an amazing<br/>\ngift -- I cannot gush enough about him ::bg::)<br/>\nI love my lists :) Short of winning the lottery, buying the entire state of<br/>\nKansas and creating my own Utopian Unschooling Society, there&#39;s nothing to<br/>\nreplace the gifts I&#39;ve found online :D<br/>\nIt&#39;s not the same, I know... letting go of what it *should be like* has<br/>\nreally benefited my life (in 12 million ways!), what it *really is* ain&#39;t so<br/>\nbad.<br/>\n-- <br/>\n~diana :)<br/>\nxoxoxoxo<br/>\nhannahbearski.blogspot.com<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":23632384,"authorName":"woebetty","from":"&quot;woebetty&quot; &lt;Woebetty@...&gt;","profile":"woebetty","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"support groups","postDate":"1208386139","msgId":34340,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGZ1NXZvcit1a3VmQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":34341,"prevInTime":34339,"nextInTime":34341,"topicId":34340,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"We have been unschooling for about a year and a half now (my son is 11), and I have been searching for a good homeschool support group.
