I&#39;ve treated several<br/>\nfor odd bites received while they were supposedly alone in the yard. They<br/>\ncome along the creek beds and drainage ditches and are quite comfortable in<br/>\ncities and towns.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of nights ago I heard hooting from the fireplace and we went out<br/>\nand saw a large owl perched on the chimney (we&#39;re still in suburbia.) Way<br/>\ncool, but my 7 lb. dachshund didn&#39;t get her nightly run in the yard! (She<br/>\nand her 11 lb daughter are the smallest dogs I&#39;ve ever had, and the best. I<br/>\nhighly recommend small useless dogs now! :))<br/>\n<br/>\nKaren</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12014,"nextTopicId":11863}}
