I really trust their judgment of <br/>\npeople.  I have asked them if they are comfortable, and they are.  I <br/>\nthink that they are really accepting of the father&#39;s personality, <br/>\nbecause we have not said anything that would cause them to feel <br/>\notherwise.  He is kind of a known element in our community, although <br/>\nit is different when you start to strike up a real relationship with <br/>\npeople rather than casual elevator conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, with that said, I do not believe that they are considering <br/>\nthe same set of information as I am in making their decision.  They <br/>\nare so used to my husband and I being around them that they are very <br/>\ntrusting, and I think that they would expect that we would not put <br/>\nthem into a dangerous or uncomfortable situation.  I have not shared <br/>\nany concerns about the gun the father wears, or the gun locker (my <br/>\nhusband and I have both acknowledged that it&#39;s important for the <br/>\nlocker to stay locked, and only the dad to go in), or the father&#39;s <br/>\nhot temper with our girls.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWould you share, and if so, how might you share these with 8 and 6 <br/>\nyo&#39;s, without making it seem like a scary situation?  I am starting <br/>\nto get a sense of how I might be able to approach this, but would <br/>\ndefinitely still appreciate help.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Maybe make a big deal about doing something special with your son, <br/>\n </span></blockquote>so  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; he doesn&#39;t feel left out, and he will have done something the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>girls  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; are a little envious of.

That&#39;s what I used to do when one child was left <br/>\n </span></blockquote>out.   <br/>\nI have been having these really great play sessions with my son, but <br/>\non days when he seems a little more fragile and likely to melt down <br/>\nwhen they leave, I do have a few options of places to take him. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also just need to find a way to get over the feeling of how unfair <br/>\nit is to my son.  He is so sweet, and he knows that he is unwelcome <br/>\nand excluded, and that hurts me so much to see.  I see though, that <br/>\nbeing the adult means that I might need to put my sense of fairness <br/>\naside, and just focus on making the best of the situation for him.  <br/>\nHopefully the more positive instances we have, the better it will <br/>\nfeel over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; I don&#39;t think you should get a sitter for your son to go with the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>girls.<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; When I invite a kid over to play, it doesn&#39;t mean I want the mom <br/>\n </span></blockquote>over  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; too.  It&#39;s more work to have another adult over than to just add a  <br/>\n&gt; kid to the mix I already have (had; mine are not little now, but <br/>\n </span></blockquote>they  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; were!).<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I would really put babysitting my son last on the list.  You are <br/>\ncorrect that the mom doesn&#39;t want more people there.  She is usually <br/>\nworking while the kids are playing, and in effect, my daughters are <br/>\nbabysitting her daughter while she is there.  She&#39;s even said <br/>\njokingly that she would be willing to pay for playdates.  I think <br/>\nthat she would relish actually having her daughter come to our home <br/>\non her own, but her daughter is also hesitant to play away from her.  <br/>\nI&#39;ve thought that if we could improve the little brother situation, <br/>\nthen we could exchange playdates, and I&#39;m sure at some time that <br/>\nmight happen, but not for now.  We do have them stay for dinner <br/>\nsometimes, though, and the little girl seems fine with my son then, <br/>\nfor the most part.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; Can the kids call if they get uncomfortable so you could go and <br/>\n </span></blockquote>get  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; them, or so they could talk to you?  If so, and if they know <br/>\n </span></blockquote>you&#39;re  <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; at the other end of the phone, that seems a good measure.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>You know, this highlights something that I think is important for me <br/>\nto talk with the girls about.  Because we have always traveled as a <br/>\npack, the girls have not really been focused on learning the typical <br/>\nemergency information that you might expect.  Because this family is <br/>\nin the building, simply a few floors away, I have not stressed this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I think that it might be reasonable for me to suggest that <br/>\nif they want to go out to dinner with this family, and play without <br/>\nme there, that it might be a good idea for us to go ahead and <br/>\nmemorize things like our phone number, address, etc.  My oldest has <br/>\nasked if she can get a cell phone when she gets older, and I&#39;ve told <br/>\nher that when it seems like she needs one, then we will go ahead and <br/>\nget it.  Perhaps now is the right time for one that will dial <br/>\nhome/mom cell/dad cell.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much, this is very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":193844353,"authorName":"Nicole Willoughby","from":"Nicole Willoughby &lt;cncnawilloughby@...&gt;","profile":"cncnawilloughby","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Friendships, Autonomy, Safety, etc.","postDate":"1187021588","msgId":30308,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1NTE3NS40NjU1MC5xbUB3ZWIzMTkwOS5tYWlsLm11ZC55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PDkzMkUwNjI4LTdGOEUtNDI4NC04ODA2LUE4MEYxMTcwQzg3M0BzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":30305,"nextInTopic":30310,"prevInTime":30307,"nextInTime":30309,"topicId":30303,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Can the kids call if they get uncomfortable so you could go and get them, or so they could talk to you?

Looking at this at first glance it seems reasonable since <br/>\nyou never know what could happen but at the same time there will <br/>\ncome a time when they *will* be with other people out in the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts like he parents who do not want their kids talking to the <br/>\nopposite sex because it might lead to something but they forget that <br/>\nkids need interaction so they can relate to being around others. For <br/>\na boy they need to be around boys so they get to know them so that <br/>\nwhen dating happens they are not so sheltered that they get into <br/>\ntrouble. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hear the fear from you that you are scraed when they are not with <br/>\nyou BUT you have to let that go a little and then a little more. <br/>\nTrust them and teach them to trust themselves- my daughter is 4 and <br/>\ndo not go anywhere without me but recently she met a girl who is 8 <br/>\nand they want to go play together. I let them outside without me <br/>\nbecause this girl is older and very motherly and they have to stay <br/>\nwithin range of my sight out the door. It is scary to let your kids <br/>\ngo but do not protect so much at they can not learn or try out their <br/>\nown skills. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The father is also part of the challenge.  We have known him <br/>\n </span></blockquote>casually <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; for about 10 years, and are getting to know him better, but still <br/>\n </span></blockquote>not <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; someone we would call best buds.

It is my understanding that it <br/>\n </span></blockquote>is <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; ALWAYS locked, and this guy is almost zealotous in his safety <br/>\n&gt; orientation, so I believe that for the most part.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>So is this a challenge or not- Is your daughter comfortable around <br/>\nhim? I have kids who come to play at my house and when they see my <br/>\nhusband for the first time some of them say &quot;I have to go home now&quot;. <br/>\nI have told my older son (14) to not tell his friends when he was <br/>\ncoming home so that if he needed a way out he could say &quot;i have to <br/>\ngo home now&quot; or if he calls to check in I will ask him if he needs <br/>\nor wants to come home. Sometimes he would say yes and I would say ok <br/>\ntell them you  have to come home now. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; The relationship with my son is challenging to me.  The girls love <br/>\n&gt; their little friend, but it can be hard on my son sometimes to not <br/>\n </span></blockquote>be <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; welcome in their home.  Historically I have taken the approach of <br/>\n&gt; staying with him, because he is very attached, and the girls seem <br/>\n&gt; comfortable.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>This is challenging maybe a compromise could be every so often they <br/>\npaly at your house with the brother but mostly play alone. I do not <br/>\nthink I caught how old your son was. If young enough can you <br/>\nredirect him to other things?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  I do have the opportunity to have our helper stay with <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; our son, but I think that he would be very upset about me going <br/>\n </span></blockquote>down <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; with the girls and him staying upstairs.  That is just not the <br/>\n </span></blockquote>usual <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; mo for him - he is always with me, unless I am going to a doctor&#39;s <br/>\n&gt; appointment. <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I am finding it so complex, because it is what my daughters want <br/>\n </span></blockquote>and <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; they feel utterly comfortable with the situation, so I do not want <br/>\n </span></blockquote>to <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; make them upset about imposing requirements (or create an <br/>\n&gt; unnecessarily fearful scenario for them by sharing all of my <br/>\n&gt; concerns).  On the other hand, I want to make sure that I feel <br/>\n&gt; comfortable, and currently, I do not always feel comfortable at <br/>\n </span></blockquote>all <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; times, particularly if I know that the father has been home and my <br/>\n&gt; girls are there.  <br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is one of those situations where it is probably truly a 0% <br/>\n&gt; likelihood that anything bad will ever happen, but I am just <br/>\n </span></blockquote>trying <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; to do the job of looking out for risk for my children, and this <br/>\n&gt; situation has red flags in it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>I hear you  here- the first time my son had a sleepover with a new <br/>\nfriend they were about 7 at the time I was scared to death that the <br/>\nkids father would somehow molest him. Probably unrealistic but we <br/>\nhave all heard those stories right. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have to balance real RED FLAGS with our mothers FEARS <br/>\nand walk between them. I am trying to ask my girls how they feel <br/>\nabout a situation and foster an enviroment that they will tellme <br/>\nanything. My son is like that he knows that I will listen and give <br/>\nadvice not just the normal mom stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I would watch for warning signs from your girls. Are the <br/>\nhesitant to go other when dad is home, are they drastically <br/>\ndifferent upon coming home? If you feel it is unsafe what could you <br/>\ndo to make it safer? Maybe you could go over there with them- it <br/>\nwould show the mom you DO NOT need a break and maybe they could play <br/>\nwith brother too. More work on your part but maybe worth the trouble <br/>\nso see how the situation plays out<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; I feel like there is the need for more communication and possibly <br/>\n&gt; some limit setting, but I want to do it very carefully, with all <br/>\n&gt; parties, obviously.  That means I need to think a lot and could <br/>\n </span></blockquote>use <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; some input and examples of more experienced parents.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Maybe ask yourself how to empower your daughter to listen to her gut <br/>\nand trust her choices which may not be your choices. What skills cna <br/>\nyou give her with out scaring her? How can you improve or foster a <br/>\nrelationship with her that she will talk to you and confide in you <br/>\nwithout you jumping to rules and limiting. Now she is 4 but she will <br/>\nbe 10 and 16 and 18 and may need advice without you being scared of <br/>\nthe unknown. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy daughter wanted to check out the friends house (they happen to <br/>\nhave the apartment above us) but she did not want to go alone and <br/>\nwanted me to come too to check out the friends room. I did not want <br/>\nto go but knew it was important to her that I come and check it out <br/>\nwith her so we all marched upstairs and I told the dad what we were <br/>\ndoing and why and he was fine with it. Most of all it showed my <br/>\ndaughter that I would walk with her through difficult times and we <br/>\ncould trust each other. She will listen to my judgment but also push <br/>\nto make her own choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou want them to be prepared to fight the world not shrink from it. <br/>\nJust because it is uncomfortable for you does not make it wrong. I <br/>\nhave a sister who decided her kids would only have sleep overs at <br/>\nher house because of all the bad stuff that could happen. What she <br/>\ndoes not understand is that it would more than likely be a family <br/>\nmember hurting kids then outsiders so her kids would not really <br/>\nbe &quot;more&quot; safe they would just not have the skills to navigate in <br/>\nthis world. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope something in here helps you<br/>\nJulieH <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n&gt; It is difficult for me to ask other parents where we live, because <br/>\n </span></blockquote>I <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; think we have been outside of the norm, given the girls request <br/>\n </span></blockquote>that <br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; we always be there.

If so, and if they know you&#39;re  <br/>\nat the other end of the phone, that seems a good measure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":176439663,"authorName":"kacsshultz","from":"&quot;kacsshultz&quot; &lt;kashultz@...&gt;","profile":"kacsshultz","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Friendships, Autonomy, Safety, etc.","postDate":"1187014148","msgId":30303,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGY5cG9tNCtvbHJqQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":30304,"prevInTime":30302,"nextInTime":30304,"topicId":30303,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I sent a post to a different list a while ago, but haven t gotten any responses, so I would appreciate thoughts from this list.

She is very &quot;protective&quot; <br/>\nof her toys and does not wish to have our son participate in the <br/>\nplaydates.  My daughters also enjoy the opportunity to go and play <br/>\nsomewhere new, and to have some time without their brother, so they <br/>\nreally really look forward to these play dates.  The little girl also <br/>\nhas a nice bedroom, lots of different kinds of toys, and the three <br/>\ngirls genuinely get along really well and are very sweet with each <br/>\nother, looking for gifts for each other, thinking about each other <br/>\nand what they like etc.  The mom is nice, and they have been coming <br/>\nupstairs to our place somewhat regularly too, so we&#39;ve been getting <br/>\nto know each other better, and she is a reasonably gentle mom, <br/>\nalthough her daughter will go to school, etc.  They are committed to <br/>\nstaying in our building, and because the girls really like each <br/>\nother, she seems committed to helping their friendship grow.  It is <br/>\nalso helpful to the mom for the girls to play down at her place, <br/>\nbecause she works from home, and a part of the playdate usually <br/>\noccurs when she is trying to get a few last things done and could use <br/>\nthe distraction for her daughter.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the parts that are challenging for me.  I am not used to <br/>\nbeing separate from my daughters.  Up until now, they have always <br/>\nwanted me right there for any activity, from playdates to parties to <br/>\nclasses.  They are playing downstairs 1-2/week for several hours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere have been several times where the mom has taken the girls out <br/>\nfor dinner in our neighborhood (walking distance), and my husband has <br/>\nnot been available to accompany them, so I&#39;ve let them go with the <br/>\nmom.  I truly believe that the mom is trying to &quot;do me a favor&quot; by <br/>\ngetting the girls out for dinner, and giving me some down time.  What <br/>\nshe doesn&#39;t know is that I really enjoy being with my kids as much as <br/>\npossible, and would rather we not be separated from them.  My post to <br/>\nthe other list was triggered by the fact that they were going to take <br/>\nthe kids out to dinner, but were going to drive somewhere.  There <br/>\nended up not being enough booster seats, so the dinner became a <br/>\nwalking dinner.  She thought that the only issue was the car seats.  <br/>\nFrankly, after my husband and I discussed it, we are not sure we even <br/>\nwant anyone else driving our kids around the city without us in the <br/>\ncar.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe father is also part of the challenge.  We have known him casually <br/>\nfor about 10 years, and are getting to know him better, but still not <br/>\nsomeone we would call best buds.  He can be really sweet, is very <br/>\nprotective of his daughter, and very cautious and safety-oriented.  <br/>\nOn the other hand, he is also a fairly hot-tempered, foul language <br/>\nusing Chicago policeman, and he wears a gun regularly, and there are <br/>\nguns in a locked cabinet at home.  It is my understanding that it is <br/>\nALWAYS locked, and this guy is almost zealotous in his safety <br/>\norientation, so I believe that for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relationship with my son is challenging to me.  The girls love <br/>\ntheir little friend, but it can be hard on my son sometimes to not be <br/>\nwelcome in their home.  Historically I have taken the approach of <br/>\nstaying with him, because he is very attached, and the girls seem <br/>\ncomfortable.  I do have the opportunity to have our helper stay with <br/>\nour son, but I think that he would be very upset about me going down <br/>\nwith the girls and him staying upstairs.  That is just not the usual <br/>\nmo for him - he is always with me, unless I am going to a doctor&#39;s <br/>\nappointment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am finding it so complex, because it is what my daughters want and <br/>\nthey feel utterly comfortable with the situation, so I do not want to <br/>\nmake them upset about imposing requirements (or create an <br/>\nunnecessarily fearful scenario for them by sharing all of my <br/>\nconcerns).  On the other hand, I want to make sure that I feel <br/>\ncomfortable, and currently, I do not always feel comfortable at all <br/>\ntimes, particularly if I know that the father has been home and my <br/>\ngirls are there.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is one of those situations where it is probably truly a 0% <br/>\nlikelihood that anything bad will ever happen, but I am just trying <br/>\nto do the job of looking out for risk for my children, and this <br/>\nsituation has red flags in it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like there is the need for more communication and possibly <br/>\nsome limit setting, but I want to do it very carefully, with all <br/>\nparties, obviously.  That means I need to think a lot and could use <br/>\nsome input and examples of more experienced parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is difficult for me to ask other parents where we live, because I <br/>\nthink we have been outside of the norm, given the girls request that <br/>\nwe always be there.  I believe it is common for kids to have dropoff <br/>\nplaydates and birthday parties at much younger ages.  They were doing <br/>\nit at age 4, when our daughter attended preschool for 1 year.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts would be very much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nKelly</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":30245,"nextTopicId":30317}}
