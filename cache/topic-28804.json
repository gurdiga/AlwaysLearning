I feel <br/>\nreally sad that it happened.  Mothers are supposed to love their <br/>\nkids <br/>\nand protect them. I am sad you did not have a mother that did that. <br/>\nHe <br/>\nthen in turn had permission to share his feelings. He one day asked <br/>\nto <br/>\ncall former mom and confronted her with the whys&#39;. He yelled at her <br/>\nand  she said she was sorry.

Remember she was my friend long before he came <br/>\ninto her <br/>\nlife.  I explained to him how I had known her for twenty years and I <br/>\nreally did love her and that was why what happened hurt me so <br/>\ndeeply. <br/>\nHe then shared that he loved her a lot too.

Young kids might seem to ignore it and simply go on <br/>\nwith their play.  Teens often have a lot of anger.  I forget the <br/>\ndetails.  Barbara Coloroso has a book, Parenting Through <br/>\nCrisis,  that is helpful on what it&#39;s like for kids as well as how to <br/>\nget through it as a parent.  One thing I do remember reading when a <br/>\nfriend died and her daughter was 10 was that many pre-adolescents <br/>\nhave delayed grief that hits them maybe five years later when they&#39;re <br/>\nmaybe more able to wrestle with bigger ideas and issues.  I know it <br/>\nsaid that for girls in that huge enormous mother loss situation.  Not <br/>\nsure if was more universally applicable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that a grief counselor told me - for me - that has <br/>\nhelped me and lots of the people I&#39;ve shared it with is from the <br/>\ntitle of a poem, &quot;Grief is a Circular Staircase.&quot;  The surprising <br/>\nthing for me about grief is how it seems like you keep circling back <br/>\naround the same places.  It&#39;s really different than Elizabeth <br/>\nKubler-Ross&#39; stages of grief model which is very linear, first <br/>\ndenial, then...  I think those &quot;stages&quot; happen but not necessarily in <br/>\norder and you don&#39;t necessarily &quot;finish&quot; a stage before moving <br/>\non.  It&#39;s like a circular staircase, where you come around to the <br/>\nsame place you were before, but with a different perspective, higher <br/>\nup, more removed maybe.  But just because you feel anger at some <br/>\npoint a few years later, it doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t healing.  I can <br/>\nstill feel shock that my mother&#39;s dead, even ten years later, though <br/>\nnot nearly so often and not nearly so intensely as shortly after.  I <br/>\nwish I could find the poem.

He came to us <br/>\nat nearly seven after having an adoptive family of four years give <br/>\nhim back to the state. That boy had grief.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the things we did was to keep talking and keeping the focus <br/>\non the actual issue. When he was angry and mean to his sister, we <br/>\nhelped him refocus on what he was actually upset about. Sometimes it <br/>\ntook guess work on our part and it took him a long time to actually <br/>\ntrust us. But all of the feelings, anger, despair, depression, <br/>\nconfusion, denial are part of moving through it. They are not <br/>\ncomfortable, they are not fun for anyone. Kids process emotionally <br/>\nand those emotions bubble up physically. It is up to us to help them <br/>\nhave the words to process what they are feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the research done on grief an average, well coping, adult takes <br/>\nabout two years to process a big loss. In comparison it takes a <br/>\nchild six to eight years. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the things that help us process those losses are the support <br/>\nwe get from other people. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when my fil was killed. I just kept calling and talking <br/>\nto people. I am certain I repeated and repeated myself, but it was <br/>\nthe way I had to move through that loss. Kids do not always know <br/>\nwhat words to put to their feelings and often need help with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTy has now lived in our home for two and a half years. He still <br/>\nexperiences some seasonal grief, like the time of year he lost his <br/>\nfamily he will be angry or sad. I really try and pay attention and <br/>\nknow when those times might be coming up. I help him identify what <br/>\nis going on with him. His overall sadness and anger have passed. <br/>\nThey have moved through him like a wave. Holidays were especially <br/>\nhard for him and he has had several that were joyous now and not <br/>\nfilled with emotional past ghosts.

I think if you keep the  <br/>\nchannels of communication as open as possible, and, as Gail said,  <br/>\ntalk about what you are feeling (perhaps recognizing that an  <br/>\nunexpected outburst had its roots in your own grieving and bringing  <br/>\nthat out) will help your boys deal with their own feelings.

We all had things to feel guilty about.   <br/>\nI&#39;ve had other friends commit suicide since.  It&#39;s rough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad died naturally (VA hospital helped, but it wasn&#39;t suicide).   <br/>\nMy sister and I first were disagreeing about how he was as a dad, and  <br/>\nI quickly realized we didn&#39;t need to agree about it.  We were 22 and  <br/>\n25, I think, and my relationship with him was just very different  <br/>\nfrom hers and that was fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince then it&#39;s been easier and clearer to me.  Still not easy, but  <br/>\nmuch less frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy husband&#39;s brother died at 54 recently of lung cancer, pretty  <br/>\nsuddenly.  Diagnosed and dead within a week.  Kirby didn&#39;t know him  <br/>\nvery well and about a month later he had a huge attack of double  <br/>\nguilt, because he hadn&#39;t known him well enough to feel really bad  <br/>\nabout it, and thought he should have taken the opportunity and all  <br/>\nthat.  I assured him it was really okay that he hadn&#39;t known him  <br/>\ndifferently or better.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy dad&#39;s mom seemed disturbed that I had fond memories of my Papaw  <br/>\n(who died naturally).  I thought of him as a really nice guy who took  <br/>\nme for rides in his big old car and got me &quot;pop&quot; (Dr Pepper in a  <br/>\nbottle) and let me sit in his lap.  She had lots of bad stories on  <br/>\nhim and frustration and anger.  She thought I should know about those  <br/>\nthings, but I told her that wasn&#39;t MY relationship with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Maybe some of that kind of exploration would help your kids.  They  <br/>\ndon&#39;t need to know anything about their uncle except what they  <br/>\nexperienced with him themselves.  He will live in each person&#39;s  <br/>\nmemory in a different way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was going through photos yesterday and putting some up where others  <br/>\ncould get to them.  I just finished writing a brief blurb about my  <br/>\nhusband&#39;s first SCA squire, who hiked up into the mountains and took  <br/>\naspirin and liquor and died, because he had been convicted of picking  <br/>\nup an arrowhead on federal property and keeping it, and because his  <br/>\ngirlfriend broke up with him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came across another photo, looking for that one, of another friend,  <br/>\nan alcoholic, who went through friends and relatives in Arizona,  <br/>\nmoved here and went through our crowd (he lived at our house for a  <br/>\nyear and some) and then moved to Utah, irritated a group of people  <br/>\nthere, and killed himself.  He was sweet when he was sweet, and awful  <br/>\nwhen he was drinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut with depression and suicidal thoughts, there don&#39;t even have to  <br/>\nbe &quot;reasons&quot; like those.  It can be no more than the feeling that  <br/>\nlife is just very, very tiring and futile and it would be nice not to  <br/>\nwake up.  I know because I&#39;ve had that feeling.  It wasn&#39;t a spiteful  <br/>\nor mean or fearful feeling, just a wistful kind of wish for  <br/>\ndarkness.  Counselling can help!  (Anti-depressants can help.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe talk to your children about that, too.  Say sometimes things  <br/>\nlike that can be related to depression, and that might be genetic,  <br/>\nand if they do start feeling those feelings they should go to a  <br/>\ncounsellor who can help them come back away from the edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":213515657,"authorName":"Nicole","from":"&quot;Nicole&quot; &lt;nicemommy@...&gt;","profile":"nderoin","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"4"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] kids and grieving","postDate":"1179331106","msgId":28806,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwNTAwMWM3OTdkMyQwYWM2MjU4MCRhYjAxYThjMEBOaWNvbGVMYXB0b3A+","inReplyToHeader":"PDExNzkzMjk1ODIuMzAwLjg4ODY1Lm00MEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+","referencesHeader":"PDExNzkzMjk1ODIuMzAwLjg4ODY1Lm00MEB5YWhvb2dyb3Vwcy5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":28805,"nextInTopic":28807,"prevInTime":28805,"nextInTime":28807,"topicId":28804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"In our past we have had a number of deaths and on book I found that helps us is Tear Soup by Pat Schwiebert.

I think it&#39;s important to discuss some of your sadness with  your children <br/>\nas well as ways you work through your grief.  It can be a  long process and <br/>\nperhaps sharing some of the things you are doing both in and  out of therapy <br/>\nmight be beneficial to your children. Talk about your sadness as  well as your <br/>\nwonderful happy memories of your brother.  Don&#39;t pressure them  to talk about <br/>\nit.  <br/>\n <br/>\nSix weeks is not that long.  I&#39;d suggest waiting on any outside  intervention <br/>\nfor awhile. My brother died unexpectedly almost two years  ago.  A completely <br/>\ndifferent situation as my kids are older and we didn&#39;t  live close to him, <br/>\nhowever, something that did help us all is to just get out of  the house.  I <br/>\nfelt closer to my brother just being outside and it helped  the kids when they <br/>\nwere busy doing something new.  It gave us all something  else to focus on and <br/>\ngave me some time to think and work through my grief  knowing they were happily <br/>\noccupied.  It&#39;s a long and ongoing process.   I&#39;d just recommend not worrying <br/>\nabout  fixing it and making everything  okay.  Things will get better and <br/>\neasier.  But it will be  awhile.<br/>\n <br/>\nGail<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n************************************** See what&#39;s free at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aol.com\">http://www.aol.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":133126509,"authorName":"Amie","from":"&quot;Amie&quot; &lt;amiersa2@...&gt;","profile":"mascire2","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"kids and grieving","postDate":"1179328515","msgId":28804,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDM1RDIzMTFCRDc3QzQwNzk4NTNGOUZGNDI1NjI1MTQ4QEFtaWVQQz4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":28805,"prevInTime":28803,"nextInTime":28805,"topicId":28804,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I am wondering if anyone can help me with some ideas on how to assist my kids right now.
