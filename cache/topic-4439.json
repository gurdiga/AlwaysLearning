We were outside with another neighbor and the other neighbor commented that the spitting kid was really giving his sister a hard time.  The mom said he was just like her brothers when she was growing up.  When I mentioned about the spitting incedent she said the reason I had trouble with him was that I had tattled on him.  He has no respect for people that tattle.  I guess what she was saying was that I needed to figure out a way to deal with him myself.  It is something I&#39;m trying to learn because I tend to not want to deal with rotten kids.  My kids tire very quickly of friends that do not know how to act.

On the least likely to defend himself.  <br/>\nAnd the place they were going wasn&#39;t a really warm place.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo in exchange for my having had him in the house for 24 hours with his <br/>\nhyperness, lack of need to sleep (he&#39;s like me--six hours or seven, and going <br/>\nstrong again, while the other boys are still sleeping), constant teasing and <br/>\ncommentary,  he had to endure my analysis of it in a stressful moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe&#39;re still friends.  He really DOES want to interact in a good way, he&#39;s <br/>\njust jittery, zippy, and used to mean fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe&#39;s also left school to homeschool, a few months ago.  And he&#39;s less &quot;out <br/>\nthere&quot; already.  He used to be trying to impress school kids and he&#39;d paint <br/>\nhis nails black, dye his hair green, wear weird necklaces and bracelets and <br/>\nt-shirts and attention-getting coats, and so forth.  The last couple of times <br/>\nI&#39;ve seen him he was losing the stench of desperation.  He&#39;s getting older <br/>\n(one reality) and now he&#39;s trying to fit in with a homeschooled group which <br/>\ndoesn&#39;t require flash and freakishness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":4495,"nextTopicId":4491}}
