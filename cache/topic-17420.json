How wonderful to know that there are other children in the world who are free to expereince angst without the risk of losing mother&#39;s love.  Bless you, bless you, bless you.<br/>\n <br/>\nRetta<br/>\n <br/>\nShe was at my feet, screaming and crying.  I reached out and <br/>\npicked up one of her favorite candy bars, KitKat, and paid for that <br/>\ntoo.  Janene refused to leave.  She held on to the counter, screaming, <br/>\nout of control.  I picked her up and carried her gently to the car.  <br/>\nHer <br/>\nlittle arms wrapped around me and she loved on me as she was screaming <br/>\nat me.  I just held her tight, until she settled and then put her in <br/>\nher <br/>\ncarseat and we drove home.  About half way home I started talking about <br/>\nthe plan for the evening, janene and I go upstairs to cuddle in bed, <br/>\nand <br/>\nLexie and Taylor wait downstairs for Taylor&#39;s mom.  Janene started to <br/>\nsay she didn&#39;t have a candy when I told her that I had bought her a <br/>\ncandy.  She was so happy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThisi s a long convoluted way of saying that a few years ago I would <br/>\nhave said &quot;she doesn&#39;t get a candy, she had a tantrum.&quot;  But thanks to <br/>\nall of you, instead I thought &quot;she is so tired, it&#39;s hard to make a <br/>\nchoice.&quot;  I don&#39;t think she saw the candy as a &quot;reward&quot; for her <br/>\nbehavior, as I have been taught would happen.  Instead I think she saw <br/>\nit as a--I don&#39;t know, Sandra, Pam, all of you, help me out, a symbol <br/>\nof <br/>\nmy love, that even through she was upset, I still loved her.  Maybe <br/>\nmore. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, she&#39;s quiet in bed now and I&#39;m going to go cuddle until she <br/>\ngoes <br/>\nto sleep. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoylyn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n---------------------------------<br/>\nDo you Yahoo!?<br/>\nProtect your identity with Yahoo!
