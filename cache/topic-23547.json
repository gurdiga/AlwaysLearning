He would be happy to spend all day, every day, on the <br/>\ncomputer, much of it playing fps games.  I know that all this activity isn&#39;t <br/>\nwasted--he&#39;s a wiz at these games, he knows the computer inside and out (well, pretty <br/>\nmuch--he&#39;s screwed up a few things in the process of learning).  We live in a <br/>\nrural area, and he doesn&#39;t drive yet; finances are so stressed that we can&#39;t <br/>\nafford his car insurance when he does drive.  So, there is the isolation <br/>\nfactor.  Then, I&#39;m finding myself fretting about his writing and mathematical <br/>\nabilities.  He reads well, but writes as little as possible, and I suspect some <br/>\nlearning disabilities in math.<br/>\n<br/>\nTiming is everything--this was supposed to be the time when he&#39;d really start <br/>\nto blossom, as he had been the past year or so.  Now our life feels like it <br/>\nhas collapsed and I&#39;m trying to figure out the best way to parent him when both <br/>\nof his parents will be gone much of the time.  I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not younger, and <br/>\nI do know that there are valuable lessons he&#39;ll be learning through this <br/>\nwhole mess, but I feel an urgent need to better prepare him for adulthood and I&#39;m <br/>\nnot going to be around as much to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is the youngest of our three children, the others married or in college. <br/>\nI&#39;m not done with him yet and our life just got way more complicated!
