Unschooled kids don&#39;t lose that curiosity like schooled kids do.  I suppose it in some ways school is a means to an end and unschooling is more about the journey.  If it&#39;s a journey then pushing won&#39;t be needed, encouragement sometimes, stopping and resting sometimes, changing directions sometimes, getting fuel sometimes, but not pushing.  Pushing requires a passive object that can be pushed.

We live in Orlando, FL and started homeschooling about 7 months ago, but unschooling for only a month, maybe two. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am grateful for the recent post on this group &quot;Moving past deschooling to unschooling&quot;--thank you! Kathy described my experiences in the past month of watching my son unravel the years of traditional school experiences (since he was 2 1/2), and even when we started homeschooling months ago. How long will it take to deschool--not only him, but me, too???<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes every ounce of self restraint to not pull out a workbook or push a writing exercise on him when a panic attack of &quot;I&#39;m not doing enough&quot; hits me. I am watching and waiting now more than anything. I am trying very hard to relax, learn his learning style, and capitalize on teachable moments WITHOUT going on 10 minute rants with unsolicited information.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, my son is saying that he likes homeschooling. That is a first since we started 7 months ago. He is actually pulling books out on his own, reading or looking at pictures--I&#39;m not sure, but I don&#39;t care. Three months ago, he wouldn&#39;t go near a book unless I pushed him (and I was so proud that he started reading at 4 in Montessori--I didn&#39;t know I was setting him up to hate reading by age 7).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing so far is that I am actually listening to my children now and trusting them. They seem happier and I see self-direction and self-initiation from them more. Perhaps it was always there and I was just too busy worrying about my agenda and what I thought they should be learning to see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still need help and I still have fear, which is why I signed on to this group.  Am I romanticizing unschooling? Is this really going to work? When do I know that I may need to push them more?<br/>\nTrue unschooling is rare around here and more often than not, I eventually find myself comparing, worrying, and doubting. <br/>\nThanks for being there and any suggestions on readings, support, or resources would be terrific!<br/>\nMisa</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":32977,"nextTopicId":52648}}
