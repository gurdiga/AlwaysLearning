Only a couple of times <br/>\nhave I risked it and only once has one of my sisters responded to <br/>\nsomething - it was an anti-school thing I posted and she&#39;s an elementary <br/>\nschool teacher with several different teaching credentials. She posted <br/>\n&quot;yawn.&quot;  I left it without responding and, thank you, none of my friends <br/>\nresponded, either. I have no idea what it meant, but she and I just <br/>\nspent the last 3 hours having coffee together and just hanging out and <br/>\nI&#39;m really glad we can ignore our sometimes-glaring differences of <br/>\nopinion about schooling.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaturity is NOT feeling a need to convince others around us that we&#39;re <br/>\nright. I know unschooling is awesome - it doesn&#39;t really matter what <br/>\nanybody else thinks, I don&#39;t need to argue with them, I can let them <br/>\njust keep thinking whatever they think as LONG as they treat my kids <br/>\nwell. And my sisters are super super nice and sweet to my kids - they <br/>\nobviously love them like crazy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very possible to have a good and sweet relationship with someone <br/>\nwho doesn&#39;t get unschoolingat all. I overlook the kind of conventional <br/>\ncomments my extended family might occasionally make about kids. I <br/>\noverlook that they are pretty convinced that what messes kids up is a <br/>\nlack of rules and boundaries and limits. They mean well and they don&#39;t <br/>\ntry to impose anything on my kids. They may believe in consistent rules <br/>\nand all that, they may impose chores and have regular fusses with their <br/>\nown kids over them, but how does that keep us from playing games <br/>\ntogether and talking about books we&#39;ve read and going to a movie or <br/>\nbowling?<br/>\n<br/>\nThings could have been different in my family. I could have been prickly <br/>\nand insisted that they acknowledge that unschooling is wonderful. I <br/>\ncould have alienated my sisters. I could STILL do that if I responded <br/>\nwhen they say things like, &quot;Kids need limits.&quot; But, it isn&#39;t my job to <br/>\ntell them how to parent. I don&#39;t let them tell me, either - if they ever <br/>\nsaid anything about it I&#39;d just smile and say, &quot;Hey, you know how I am, <br/>\nI always do things differently.&quot; They&#39;d smile and agree.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love to talk about unschooling - but only to those with a sincere <br/>\ninterest. One of my sisters is somewhat interested, the other not at <br/>\nall. So - I let their interest be my guide. If they seem interested, I <br/>\ngive them a bit of info, but if they wanted to just argue, I&#39;d say, &quot;I <br/>\ndon&#39;t want to argue - let&#39;s just not talk about it.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n-pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":324049237,"authorName":"Emily S","from":"&quot;Emily S&quot; &lt;saturnfire16@...&gt;","profile":"saturnfire16","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Because I Said So","postDate":"1277261103","msgId":55213,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGh2cnNmZitvdmM5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2cXRhcStwa2ZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55203,"nextInTopic":55214,"prevInTime":55212,"nextInTime":55214,"topicId":55195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I have never had a job where I was not told why I was doing what I was doing.  That&#39;s from the time I was 14 and working at a summer camp, then a pizza parlor, a golf course, retail, and property management.  I have never had a boss say or imply &quot;because I said so.&quot;  I am just sitting here scratching my head.  Now maybe the *way* they want some things done is not always the *way* I would do it and I do it that way because they said so.  But I still always understood why this particular aspect of the job needed to be done.  Even if I didn&#39;t agree it was best, there was some understanding of where they were coming from and that there was some semblance of logic and a reason behind it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI can say having been a manager at several of those jobs that any decent employer WANTS his employees to know why they are doing what they are doing because it creates a team environment, gives the employee more ownership in her job, she might come up with a better idea, she&#39;ll probably stick around longer, decreases resentment, and so many other things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the government telling us what to do &quot;just because&quot; that is just scary that anyone would think that is ok!  WE are supposed to run the government, not the other way around.  The people working for the government are hired SERVANTS of the people.  We tell them what to do, so if anyone should be saying &quot;because I said so&quot; it&#39;s the people TO the government.  If someone doesn&#39;t understand why a law is in place, they should go research it and find out why it was passed.  Then if they don&#39;t agree with it, make efforts to change it.  Not just sit there and say &quot;well I was told to do it so I guess I have to.&quot;  <br/>\n<br/>\nEmily</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":62434209,"authorName":"Jenny Cyphers","from":"Jenny Cyphers &lt;jenstarc4@...&gt;","profile":"jenstarc4","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Because I Said So","postDate":"1277237898","msgId":55203,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDMzMTU5My42OTU0LnFtQHdlYjExMDQxNC5tYWlsLmdxMS55YWhvby5jb20+","inReplyToHeader":"PGh2cXRhcStwa2ZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGh2cXRhcStwa2ZkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":55200,"nextInTopic":55213,"prevInTime":55202,"nextInTime":55204,"topicId":55195,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"*** One of the things I most regret saying to my children?
