Can someone help me differentiate between a vegetarian&#39;s experience with meat and someone who has strong feelings about &quot;healthy&quot; food and &quot;junk&quot; food and what their kids should be eating. &nbsp;I guess that&#39;s the main thing - the parent pushing their opinion onto the children.</div><div><br></div><div>I used to have a lot of opinions about food and some foods were definitely judged as being superior to others. &nbsp;I never told my kids that they couldn&#39;t eat foods that didn&#39;t fall into my &quot;special&quot; category but I did not keep &quot;non-special&quot; foods in the house. &nbsp;If they asked for something I would provide it (reluctantly &amp; with opinions, I&#39;m sure) but I did try to control their exposure to those things. &nbsp;When we became unschoolers I started releasing my judgement and providing much more exposure and opportunities to eat the foods that were previously &quot;not healthy&quot;, probably viewed as &quot;forbidden&quot; by my kids. &nbsp;They had a large amount of enthusiasm for these new foods and a sense of relief that I no longer was judgemental of their love for them. &nbsp;That period of controlling and judging food was damaging for them. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what the original poster was indicating but I am trying to clarify my thinking here about what I was

If a family&#39;s religions prohibits pork, unschoolers don&#39;t need to help a child try some.

Another thing is that we eat organic most of the time and avoid sugar and dairy so we don&#39;t offer those foods either. They do eat some at birthday parties or friends houses.
