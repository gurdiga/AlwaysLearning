She actually said, &#39;I know Lucas is going into kindergarten, but there&#39;s so much he can forget over the summer.&#39;  He was only 5 -- he&#39;s not learned enough in school to have much to forget!

The dad was laid back.  The kids were quiet and <br/>\nwhat they (the family) really wanted was two things:  playmates for their little <br/>\ngirls (who were pre-school age at the time) and possible customers for the <br/>\nmother&#39;s Sylvan reading business.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell they weren&#39;t the only family to use that playgroup as a sort of &quot;singles <br/>\nbar&quot; for kids. &lt;g&gt;   Worse things can happen.   So Holly started hanging out <br/>\nwith those girls a lot, which was good because they swam daily, and Holly <br/>\nlearned to swim really well from hanging out with them in the pool at their <br/>\napartment complex.    The parents have ended up divorced and she&#39;s visited in both <br/>\nnew homes and we got to go to the mom&#39;s wedding when she remarried.  It turned <br/>\nout good for Holly, after all, but there was a weirdness in their original <br/>\nintent. <br/>\n<br/>\nHolly sat in at Sylvan a time or two after playing with the girls where their <br/>\nmom worked.  I know the mom thought Holly NEEDED tutoring, but I was equally <br/>\nas sure she did NOT.     So I think she sneaked her a lesson or two, which <br/>\nonly gave Holly more experience about what&#39;s out there in the world that she <br/>\nmight need, or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":127921172,"authorName":"Sylvia","from":"&quot;Sylvia&quot; &lt;syltoyama@...&gt;","profile":"syltoyama","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Sylvan Learning et al","postDate":"1079543782","msgId":19075,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGMzYTE1Nit1YW1xQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":19076,"prevInTime":19074,"nextInTime":19076,"topicId":19075,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"I heard the commercial again this morning -- the one where the boy gives his Mom his improved report card for her birthday, and she s just so happy she could","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-1452264816\">I heard the commercial again this morning -- the one where the boy <br/>\ngives his Mom his improved report card for her birthday, and she&#39;s <br/>\njust so happy she could cry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the narrator goes on.... &#39;if your child is having problems, or <br/>\njust not being challenged enough....&#39;  Not challenged enough -- what <br/>\nthe heck is that about?  Like being stuck in school 7 hours a day, <br/>\nwith whatever homework isn&#39;t enough &#39;challenge?&#39;  How hard does a kid <br/>\nhave to work, to show he&#39;s being challenged?  I mean, if he&#39;s making <br/>\nA&#39;s easily will working him so hard that his grades drop indicate <br/>\nhe&#39;s finally being challenged?  Or will he still be expected to make <br/>\nA&#39;s, AND work harder?  Does your boss troll the office, doling out <br/>\nbusy work to folks who don&#39;t look challenged enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost schoolkids, when you figure in time to and from school plus <br/>\nhomework, already put in a longer day than adults who work full-<br/>\ntime.  Sounds to me like it&#39;s just a way to keep a kid so busy <br/>\nparents don&#39;t need to spend any of their own time with the poor kid.  <br/>\nTelling a kid he&#39;s not challenged enough, so you&#39;ve signed him up <br/>\nwith a tutor sounds punitive. Of course, it&#39;s really just another way <br/>\nfor Sylvan to make more money on anxious parents who never feel their <br/>\nchild is &#39;good enough.&#39;  Just another way to make parents and kids <br/>\nfeel inferior and to take more of their money..<br/>\n<br/>\nSylvia</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":19102,"nextTopicId":19122}}
