But my","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-522901215\">Today is day five of nine, halfway through driver&#39;s ed for Kirby.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe got his learner&#39;s permit the second day, so theoretically could be driving <br/>\naround.  But my car went into the shop two days before that and still isn&#39;t <br/>\nback.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSunday night I took him to a parking lot near here, at midnight, and he <br/>\nrepeatedly started and stopped the 20 year old Jetta with the standard <br/>\ntransmission.  I told him if he could deal with a clutch, the automatic would <br/>\nbe click-and-point in comparison.  There was no shifting to 2nd, just driving <br/>\naround in first, parking, going again, letting it die from letting the clutch <br/>\nout too fast, getting it flooded from too much starting.... the usual.  He <br/>\nfelt bad about the herky-jerkiness of getting it to go, and half the time it <br/>\nwas pretty smooth.  I told him nobody learns to drive a standard without some <br/>\nof those crazy jerky starts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that he hasn&#39;t driven since he got the permit (he drove the van <br/>\nsome a couple of years ago, on not-real roads, as have Marty and Holly).  <br/>\nMaybe the van will be done today.  The transmission had something broken.  <br/>\nTruly broken.  But under warranty from the second full rebuild.  I shudder...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my washing machine is also broken and the part won&#39;t be here for four days.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday Keith&#39;s coming home early to drive us to the laundramat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut back to driver&#39;s ed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first day they had a pre-test.  The teacher asked if everyone was <br/>\nthrough.  Everyone was, but Kirby, who had three more left.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy fear came true.  He had never been to school at all, and he didn&#39;t know <br/>\nnow to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a question sheet and an answer sheet.  Kirby was circling the right <br/>\nletter and then writing out the right answer.  Everyone else just circled the <br/>\nright letter (or whatever letter struck their fancy).   <br/>\n<br/>\nHe got seven out of ten.  Missed one about hydroplaning which he said wasn&#39;t <br/>\nworded well to get the answer they wanted.  I totally believe him.<br/>\n<br/>\nTh third day, Monday, they had a truck driver talk to them.  He told them how <br/>\nto drive around big trucks, and other tales of big trucks.  Then they all <br/>\nwent outside where his actual Big Truck was and he asked if anyone wanted to <br/>\nget in it.  Kirby said he looked around, and the kids were just kinda <br/>\nshuffling and avoiding eye contact (something fairly new to him &lt;g&gt;), and so <br/>\nhe said &quot;I will!&quot; and did.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThey went through showing and talking about blind spots.  Teenaged girls, <br/>\njumping and waving; Kirby couldn&#39;t see them.  Giant block of concrete with <br/>\njust happened to be there.  Kirby couldn&#39;t see it with the mirrors at all.  <br/>\n&quot;Nearly the size of a VW BUG,&quot; said the truck driver.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Kirby got out and he asked &quot;Who else?&quot;  Nobody.  Kirby said &quot;I&#39;ll go <br/>\nagain!&quot; and that shamed a couple of girls into volunteering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first two days he didn&#39;t make any friends.  The third day he made three, <br/>\nhe said, and in the course of telling the story, he named them casually.  All <br/>\ngirls.  I&#39;m not surprised.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere&#39;s a homeschooled girl there, but Kirby hasn&#39;t introduced himself to her.<br/>\nThere&#39;s a girl he recognized from Active Imagination (a while back) but he <br/>\nsaid she didn&#39;t seem to recognize him, probably because he used to have  hair <br/>\npast the middle of his back that&#39;s now short.  He told me this morning he&#39;s <br/>\nglad he didn&#39;t associate himself with her, because she&#39;s the one who&#39;s always <br/>\ndisruptive.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe likes the teacher.  &quot;Mr. Martinez is cool,&quot; he said.   Yesterday they <br/>\ntalked about drugs.  They have to for six hours, Kirby said.  So two more <br/>\nhours today, and that might mean that today is the scary-movie day.  &quot;Blood <br/>\non the Highway,&quot; I think Brett said it&#39;s called.  Everyone I&#39;ve talked to who <br/>\nsaw it was disturbed, and certainly it&#39;s mean to be disturbing.  But if <br/>\ntoday&#39;s the day I&#39;ll give Kirby more privacy and more slack til he gets <br/>\nsettled.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe works from 3:00 to 7:30 today anyway, so will only be home for a couple of <br/>\nhours.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":13081,"nextTopicId":13103}}
