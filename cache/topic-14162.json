Okay, it&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nnot a &quot;completely&quot; new book, but it is largely new. Long out of print (with<br/>\n<br/>\nused copies often going for much more than the original purchase price!),<br/>\n<br/>\nthe classic &quot;Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path to Education&quot; has now been<br/>\n<br/>\nupdated and re-released.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe new version is entitled &quot;Teach Your Own - The John Holt Book of<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling.&quot; Appropriately enough, it has been updated and edited by<br/>\n<br/>\nPatrick Farenga, the president of Holt Associates. Pat has combined personal<br/>\n<br/>\nstories and the resources from his own book, &quot;The Beginners Guide to<br/>\n<br/>\nHomeschooling,&quot; with this classic work by the father of the modern<br/>\n<br/>\nhomeschooling movement. The original was published in 1981 and was the<br/>\n<br/>\nsource of inspiration for many parents considering homeschooling. Holt&#39;s<br/>\n<br/>\nwords are every bit as inspiring today and show a timeless common-sense that<br/>\n<br/>\nwill have nodding your head in agreement as you read along.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis book will help you avoid the trap of turning your home into a miniature<br/>\n<br/>\nschool. Instead, you will be encouraged to take advantage of the flexibility<br/>\n<br/>\nhomeschooling offers you to provide an educational experience that is nearly<br/>\n<br/>\nimpossible to duplicate in schools. If you are already homeschooling but<br/>\n<br/>\nhave ever had moments of self-doubt, or wondered how to face relatives who<br/>\n<br/>\nquestion your decision, then this book will restore your confidence and<br/>\n<br/>\nremind you of the many benefits of the path you have chosen. If you are just<br/>\n<br/>\ngetting started or only considering homeschooling, then this book will help<br/>\n<br/>\nopen your eyes about the many possibilities and will supply you with a<br/>\n<br/>\nwealth of information and resources to help you on your way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLegal advice and suggestions for countering common objections to<br/>\n<br/>\nhomeschooling are included. An extensive bibliography and several appendices<br/>\n<br/>\nwill provide you with information on other books, correspondence programs,<br/>\n<br/>\ncurriculum suppliers, helpful private schools, homeschooling organizations,<br/>\n<br/>\nlearning materials, and opportunities and activities. This is a &quot;must have&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nbook for every homeschooler!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nList price is $18.00, but for a limited time is available from FUN Books for<br/>\n<br/>\n$12.50.
