She used to say &quot;Stop that crying, or I&#39;ll give you something to cry about.&quot;  I heard some variation of that dozens of times.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to what Keith and I said and did and were to our children, planning on what to do when they cry doesn&#39;t make much sense, because we decided early on NOT to give them something to cry about.  Frustrations were few, and soothed by parents.  Crying was fine, but there wasn&#39;t much sorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cried myself to sleep many times, hungry, afraid.  If one of mine did, it was probably over a problem with a friend, or having broken something they really liked.  And I&#39;m only thinking of two likely possibilities out of the lifetimes of three children.  (Late teens, for Holly, when unrequited love and boyfriends came along, that&#39;s different.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":553037573,"authorName":"tandos mama","from":"tandos mama &lt;tori.arpad.cotta@...&gt;","profile":"tandosmama@bellsouth.net","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: Unschooling vs. Hand in Hand/Parenting by Connection/Gordon Neuf","postDate":"1411991013","msgId":74861,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PENBTExDdytNdGs1UDFYZUgremgxNE90Z1ppQVRWaTVOcj1kVkRYTGRKWlExT1dRVlh1QUBtYWlsLmdtYWlsLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":0,"nextInTopic":74863,"prevInTime":74860,"nextInTime":74862,"topicId":74861,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Please don t think, that because learning how your own crying is useful, that your children need to cry in the same way.
