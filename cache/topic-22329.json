They like the product of reading, not the<br/>\nprocess.  They like knowing what the characters are saying in Tales of<br/>\nSymphonia (the gamecube game we&#39;re playing at the moment)or what the<br/>\nlatest Ranger Rick can tell them about otters or what Asterix and<br/>\nObelix are saying in the balloons above their heads.  Occasionally<br/>\nSimon (8) likes to read the noises that Obelix makes when he bashes<br/>\nsome Roman or Linnaea (5) likes to get on to Neopets and type in<br/>\nseries of letters and see if anyone has named a Neopet by that name,<br/>\nbut most of the time the reading is left to those who are more adept.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI love the process of reading.  I love that without thinking about it,<br/>\nwithout being aware of anything going on I am reading words.  I can<br/>\nremember when I first got glasses reading street signs and any sign<br/>\nwith such joy because I could, I still do that. It was interesting<br/>\nliving in Japan and being completely illiterate.  It didn&#39;t hinder<br/>\nmemuch.  It meant that if the menu wasn&#39;t in English I had to look at<br/>\nthe plastic food in the window (and on occasion take the waitress out<br/>\nto point at what I wanted) in order to see if I wanted to eat there.<br/>\nAnd that David (dh) had to get the receptionist who worked at the<br/>\nUniversity where he worked to write out the characters we needed to<br/>\nlook for on the bus we needed to take to get downtown and back home. <br/>\nWe were only there for a year and didn&#39;t feel any need or desire to<br/>\nlearn to read Japanese. We had friends who took classes and got quite<br/>\nfar at recognizing katakana in a few months.  Reading Japanese, or at<br/>\nleast a bit of Japanese, would have opened up more doors to us, but I<br/>\ndidn&#39;t feel the need.  Probably if we were going to stay there for<br/>\nlonger I would have made the effort.  David&#39;s parents lived in Japan<br/>\nfor 3 years though and neither of them can read Japanese, so maybe I<br/>\nwouldn&#39;t have invested in it anyhow.  Nobody made it fun for me, but<br/>\nmore importantly I didn&#39;t want to study Japanese.  I picked up a<br/>\nfleeting facility to recognize the kanji specific to where we lived as<br/>\nit made it easier to get home.  I can&#39;t remember the kanji at all now.<br/>\n I loved living in Kyoto though, even without the pleasure of reading<br/>\nall of the street signs or store names or restaurant menus. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have no doubt that some day Simon and Linnaea will read.  Their<br/>\nworld is full of the written word and so much of what they both enjoy<br/>\nis easier to do if you can read, but until they don&#39;t want me to read<br/>\nfor them I&#39;ll continue to, happily. I couldn&#39;t tell them how to read<br/>\nanyhow, I haven&#39;t a clue how I do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchuyler<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;Chris Swift&quot; &lt;Chris@c...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; I agree with your sentiment but how do you get to the point where<br/>\nthey can<br/>\n&gt; enjoy it ?<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reading for instance is not a natural activity.<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Reading a lot to children can get them into reading for themselves quite<br/>\n&gt; naturally but not all children respond and not all parents are good (or<br/>\n&gt; willing) book readers !<br/>\n&gt; <br/>\n&gt; Chris </span></blockquote></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":221006182,"authorName":"Chris Swift","from":"&quot;Chris Swift&quot; &lt;Chris@...&gt;","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Books, Reading and Awards","postDate":"1118676473","msgId":22365,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwOTUwMWM1NzAyYyQ3ODBjYmRhMCQ3MWEyODdkOUBwYXJhZG94Pg==","referencesHeader":"PDhiLjI5M2QyZDNlLjJmZGVmOTA2QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":22364,"nextInTopic":22366,"prevInTime":22364,"nextInTime":22366,"topicId":22329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Even if they can&#39;t do  it?  Are <br/>\nyou reading them peer reviewed research articles or  something?  &lt;g&gt;  Do they <br/>\nenjoy reading the sign that tells them  they&#39;re just tall enough to ride the <br/>\nrollercoaster?  <br/>\n <br/>\nWe read for information and we read for pleasure.  I frequently get  pleasure <br/>\nfrom reading for information (this list, my son&#39;s newsletters from  Iraq).  <br/>\nReading is a tool.  I don&#39;t have to enjoy using the hammer in  order to get my <br/>\nhouse built.  I just have to do it.  Of course, if I  really enjoyed using the <br/>\nhammer, I might build a lot more things and become a  carpenter.  But it&#39;s <br/>\nnot necessary for me to enjoy it to get what I want  (my house built).  The same <br/>\nkind of pleasure I get from reading a novel I  can get from watching a movie <br/>\nor listening to it on tape.  <br/>\n <br/>\nMaking the enjoyment of reading a goal for unschooled kids is missing the  <br/>\npoint of unschooling.  You want them to enjoy their life.  Reading  should go in <br/>\nthe same category as everything else they might enjoy.

It just wasn&#39;t fun anymore,  for lots and lots <br/>\nof reasons, and then there was the last straw that happened  during that <br/>\ngame.  But anyway, the coach kept saying during the season that  if they won a <br/>\ntournament, then he would buy pizza for everyone afterwards.   They never won any <br/>\nof the tournaments, but they got second place once and won a  lot of games.  <br/>\nWill kept hoping that their success would at least lead  to an invitation to <br/>\npizza with the team after a tournament, even if the coach  didn&#39;t pay.  It <br/>\nnever came.  (This attitude is part of the reason he  quit, but that&#39;s another <br/>\nstory.)<br/>\n <br/>\nAfter he quit, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to win ANY  tournaments, <br/>\nanyway.  Good thing for Coach Charlie--he won&#39;t have to buy  pizza at all!&quot;  <br/>\n <br/>\nWill wasn&#39;t playing ball for the pizza.

Unschooled <br/>\nkids have a better chance of putting such things in  perspective.  They grow up <br/>\nwith the idea that the doing it is the  thing.  Rewards are just the icing on <br/>\nthe cake.  They have to operate  in this culture that values rewards so <br/>\nmuch--unschooled kids shouldn&#39;t be  sheltered from it, but helped to keep it in <br/>\nproper perspective.<br/>\n <br/>\nKaren<br/>\n <br/>\nwww.badchair.net<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":202326349,"authorName":"Jordan","from":"&quot;Jordan&quot; &lt;atj090@...&gt;","profile":"jamitory","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Books, Reading and Awards","postDate":"1118576156","msgId":22342,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PEVQRUVLSEJPQVBKSExJQ0VMQ0pDQUVBTkNHQUEuYXRqMDkwQGdhbGF4eS5vY24ubmUuanA+","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjEyMDMxMzQ3LjkwODYzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxOTA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22341,"nextInTopic":22343,"prevInTime":22341,"nextInTime":22343,"topicId":22329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... that I m pondering right now.

I have a big problem with the basic premise of<br/>\nSummer Reading Programs. The whole, read this many books, and well give<br/>\nyou stuff thing.  (Alfie Kohn has a bit to say about this in Punished by<br/>\nRewards if anyone is interested.)  Now, on the bases here, they have<br/>\nshifted from a number of books to an hours of reading formula for<br/>\nawarding prizes, but it still sends the message that reading is so wretched<br/>\nthat we NEED rewards for doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that I could just let it go, but it just makes me so darn mad.  I<br/>\nmean why not have summer car repair programs at the base auto hobby shops?<br/>\nSummer Craft marathons, summer take care of animals programs?  Its not<br/>\nlike reading is the only way to learn, right?  But with reading programs, we<br/>\ntell them that reading is more important than other things, but still is so<br/>\ndifficult and unpleasant that if you suck it up and do it, youll get<br/>\nstuff.  My kids will tell our beloved library lady that reading is its own<br/>\nreward when she asks them if they want to sign up for a program!<br/>\n<br/>\nTami, who likes to read no matter what the season, but has trouble knitting<br/>\nin hot weather.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\nNo virus found in this outgoing message.<br/>\nChecked by AVG Anti-Virus.<br/>\nVersion: 7.0.323 / Virus Database: 267.6.9 - Release Date: 6/11/2005<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":59925222,"authorName":"queenjane555","from":"&quot;queenjane555&quot; &lt;queenjane555@...&gt;","profile":"queenjane555","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: Books, Reading and Awards","postDate":"1118558830","msgId":22341,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGQ4Z2xwZStka3RnQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjEyMDMxMzQ3LjkwODYzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxOTA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22335,"nextInTopic":22342,"prevInTime":22340,"nextInTime":22342,"topicId":22329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

I thought <br/>\nseamus might like it, and give us something fun to do this summer. <br/>\nHe was like &quot;reading program? No way.&quot; He doesnt particularly like <br/>\nto read books on his own (and when he does, its mostly nonfiction, <br/>\nlike those Eyewitness Books on &quot;Minerals&quot; or &quot;Robots&quot;), although i <br/>\ndo read to him every night (plus side of that is we are reading <br/>\nbooks that are far more &quot;advanced&quot; than what he could read on his <br/>\nown right now)...anyhow, we needed to stop by the library to pick up <br/>\na book we ordered (one of The Lost Years of Merlin series), and he <br/>\nsaw the display for the library program. Kids can earn one &quot;ticket&quot; <br/>\nfor each picture book, or two tickets for each chapter or nonfiction <br/>\nbook read, and save up to win prizes. He liked a couple of the <br/>\nprizes, and said &quot;Hmmmm...i think i&#39;m rethinking my decision!&quot; <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it &quot;wrong&quot; for him to want to read books solely to win a prize? I <br/>\ndont think its much different than playing skiball at Chuck E. <br/>\nCheese to get a ticket to win a toy. He can choose at any time not <br/>\nto do it, and if i end up reading the books TO him (which will <br/>\nprobably happen), i still feel its within the &quot;rules&quot; of the <br/>\nprogram. I think for an unschooler who *knows* that they can read <br/>\nthe books or not, go to the program or not, buy those prizes at the <br/>\nstore if they decide to do that, and know that being a &quot;good reader&quot; <br/>\nis not about how many books you read, or proving to anyone that you <br/>\ndid so, that any &quot;damage&quot; might be minimal. <br/>\n<br/>\nMostly we&#39;ll be going for the weekly program, i dont think Seamus <br/>\nwill get too caught up in whether he&#39;s earning enough tickets to get <br/>\na prize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nKatherine</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] Books, Reading and Awards","postDate":"1118547144","msgId":22330,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVKRkRIQUEuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDIwMDUwNjEyMDMxMzQ3LjkwODYzLnFtYWlsQHdlYjUxOTA2Lm1haWwueWFob28uY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":22329,"nextInTopic":22335,"prevInTime":22329,"nextInTime":22331,"topicId":22329,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...
