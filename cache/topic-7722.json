It SO <br/>\nindicated that she didn&#39;t and will probably never know how different my life <br/>\nwas.  And that being tired late at night and swatting a BABY, a two year old, <br/>\nfor playing happily was the evil ghost of my mom on a bad day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was apprehensive about ever having sent that out in the first place, but if <br/>\npeople hide their sins, if I hide my failures, then it&#39;s probably won&#39;t be as <br/>\nhelpful as if I edit my life to seem better than it is. I&#39;m out of words for <br/>\nthis, and Holly and I need to leave to see Peter Pan in just a minute.  <br/>\nMusical Theatre of the Southwest is putting it on at Popejoy Hall (for those <br/>\nfamiliar with UNM  or Albuquerque).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat&#39;s really cool is Holly had quit fiddle lessons.  When she wanted to go <br/>\nback the teacher was all booked up (AND his bluegrass band has lots of work <br/>\nnow, plus he&#39;s already a fully employed homeschooling dad).   But he <br/>\nrecommended another teacher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other teacher, he said, would do fiddle or classical, whichever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI told her Holly had been doing bluegrass/old-timey because Jeff liked that, <br/>\nbut what Holly&#39;s real interest was was musical theatre.<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nShe asked it strangely, and I said, &quot;Well, she likes musicals, but the tunes <br/>\nare really too hard for her as a beginner, and..&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;I LOVE musicals.  I&#39;m concert master for Musical Theatre of the Southwest!&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOH.  COOL!!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo today was Holly&#39;s first lesson with Linda Vik, and now we&#39;re leaving to <br/>\nsee Peter Pan, and will peek over and see the first-chair violinist, Linda <br/>\nVik!  <br/>\n<br/>\nTotally cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the encouragement and compliment, Rue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":106031689,"authorName":"Jon and Rue Kream","from":"&quot;Jon and Rue Kream&quot; &lt;skreams@...&gt;","profile":"jonkream","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] another article deposited in public","postDate":"1024695800","msgId":7723,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDAwMDAwMWMyMTk2YyRhYWI1ZDFjMCQ5N2FlNWIxOEBtc2hvbWUubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDJiLjI4ZjY0M2Y3LjJhNDRhYzU3QGFvbC5jb20+"},"prevInTopic":7722,"nextInTopic":7724,"prevInTime":7722,"nextInTime":7724,"topicId":7722,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Sandra - Of all of your writing that I ve read, this is my favorite.
