Or thinks of &quot;freak&quot; in the slang context of  <br/>\na sex addict (re. Rick James&#39;s song, &quot;Super Freak&quot;)?<br/>\n<br/>\n From Wikipedia:<br/>\nThe term super freak (and the term freak from which it descended) are  <br/>\nAfrican American ghetto slang (see both Slang and Ebonics). Freak and  <br/>\nsuper freak are both references to : a woman who enjoys sex; perhaps  <br/>\nbut not necessarily a woman who is promiscuous, is willing to  <br/>\nexperiment sexually or is hyper-sexualized. In common use either term  <br/>\ncan simply refer to a woman. The slang term get freaky (to act  <br/>\nsexually) derives from the same root as well.<br/>\nGiven that the standard dictionary meaning of the word freak is a  <br/>\nreference to a &quot;freak of nature&quot;, one could easily make a case that  <br/>\nthe use (and origin) of these slang terms indicating a basic belief  <br/>\nthat &#39;any woman who has a healthy sex life must be a freak of  <br/>\nnature&#39; (or at least an oddity). This lies is in stark contrast to the  <br/>\nwell researched and contradictory realities of female sexuality and  <br/>\nthe fact that women possess a much larger capacity for sexual pleasure  <br/>\nthan men do. The slang term freak and its relatives say a great deal  <br/>\nabout the views of that segment of society in which they arose (in  <br/>\nregards to preconceived ideas regarding female sexuality and socially  <br/>\nappropriate female sex roles).<br/>\nThere is a very obvious link between this terminology (and it meaning)  <br/>\nand the Madonna Whore complex in which all women must be virginal  <br/>\n(sexually untouched) or are automatically unworthy of any respect (see  <br/>\nalso references to the veneration of virginity and the practice of  <br/>\n&#39;cherry picking&#39; in western society). For an example of this in film,  <br/>\nseeSaturday Night Fever in which a casual sexual conquest by the  <br/>\ncharacter of Tony (played by John Travolta) turns into male only  <br/>\ngratification when he discovers that the woman he desires is not a  <br/>\nvirgin. The Madonna Whore complex is well documented in both  <br/>\npsychology and Feminist literature. It lies at the very roots of the  <br/>\nsexual morays of middle America and the mythology of the American  <br/>\nGolden Age (common in conservative American politics). The pervasive  <br/>\nand repressive nature of the Madonna Whore complex and the way in  <br/>\nwhich it creates an unhealthy view of female sexuality were at the  <br/>\nheart of crossover between the sexual revolution in America and the  <br/>\n20th century womens rights movement in America.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":277978071,"authorName":"Kim","from":"&quot;Kim&quot; &lt;kimjimstudz@...&gt;","profile":"mamaogo","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: freaking out","postDate":"1222968747","msgId":39020,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdjMzBqYis5cWE5QGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PENCMDQ3NkNCLUI5MDktNDc4NC1CNEFGLTk5N0E0N0NDREM2N0BtYWMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":39019,"nextInTopic":39021,"prevInTime":39019,"nextInTime":39021,"topicId":39008,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

When I realized that she may have misinterpreted him to say <br/>\nthe F word - or even if she just thought he said &quot;freaking&quot; as a <br/>\nsubstitue for a version of the F word, I tried to explain what he <br/>\nmeant.  She told me she never heard of such use of that word, and <br/>\nthat I was wrong to think it was okay.  Her receptionist was right <br/>\nthere, and I looked to her a few times to chime in, but she didn&#39;t <br/>\nseem to think it was her place.  I&#39;m hoping that perhaps they <br/>\ndiscussed it after my departure.

I just need to clear my <br/>\nhead first.
