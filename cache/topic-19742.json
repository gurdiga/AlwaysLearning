The liaison of school district that I happen to be in is incredibly supportive of homeschooling.  The licensed psychologist that I used for my dd&#39;s evaluation was respectful and very supportive of unschooling.  All he did was read over my notes that I had kept for most of the year and wrote a few sentences stating that dd was progressing according to her age.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong the families in our unschooling group, a few know licensed teachers, who are willing to sign off for our future evaluations.  So we won&#39;t have to pay the costs of a licensed psychologist.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;Any <br/>\n&gt;no-test laws in the works of being passed in Colorado?!<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Not that I know of, but I don&#39;t keep abreast of those things.  You could google for that information.

If you do, where are you planning to move?  Also, my dd wants to know the ages of your kids and if they are boys or girls.
