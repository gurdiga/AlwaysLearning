The argument the lawmakers are<br/>\ngiving is that 20 states have a starting age of 6yrs,<br/>\nand WA is only one of two states which has a starting<br/>\nage of 8yrs.  They neglect to mention that the<br/>\ncompulsory graduation age in WA is 18, as opposed to<br/>\n16 in many other states.  So they would effectively be<br/>\nadding 2 more years to a child&#39;s compulsory scooling<br/>\nyears in WA, and that means 2 years more of testing<br/>\nand assesments for homeschoolers.
