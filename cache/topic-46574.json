I was brushing his teeth for him (that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother story complete with reflux problems, 8 crowns, etc.) and he was insisting that I brush his bottom teeth with a certain &quot;sweeping&quot; motion that I just could not do right.  I tried for 30 minutes and no matter how I did it, I just could not satisfy him.  He kept crying and getting really angry.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSuddenly, it dawned on me -- there must be a deeper reason for this insistance that I brush his teeth exactly the way he wanted me to.  I recalled that earlier in the day he had lost his little toy fish at the pool.  Actually, I think some child took it home.  We searched the pool, asked everyone (had several people searching with us), looked in the grass, etc. and just could not find it.  At the time, my son was upset but went back to swimming and it seemed like he had accepted it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I realized this, I said to him, &quot;You&#39;re upset about losing your toy fish, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  He just burst out crying and said, &quot;Mommy, why would someone steal my fish?&quot;  We talked about why a child might take something that didn&#39;t belong to him/her.  We talked about how maybe next time we can &quot;protect&quot; our special belongings.  I assured him that we would look for another little fish somewhere.  We thought about making &quot;lost&quot; posters for the fish.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe insistance on me brushing his teeth &quot;correctly&quot; just went away.  He let me finish his teeth and we snuggled until he fell asleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about this incident and wondered if maybe, since my son has a need to feel in control, if maybe the loss of the toy fish made him feel a loss of control and that maybe his insistance that I brush his teeth exactly the way he wanted me to was his way of gaining back some of his control.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really cool for me because this is the first time I actually &quot;got it&quot;.  I was always reacting to my son&#39;s need for control, and this time, I looked deeper and tried to see things from his point of view.  I hope this will get easier to do.  Now that I&#39;m aware of how it all works, maybe it will.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelissa</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":247566989,"authorName":"Sandra Dodd","from":"Sandra Dodd &lt;Sandra@...&gt;","profile":"sandralynndodd","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] is &quot;being authentic&quot; a reaction to this?","postDate":"1249542943","msgId":46597,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDU4RTM0MTYzLTNCMjUtNDU0NC1CMTk3LTQ4NDMzODMwRDQxN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4=","inReplyToHeader":"PEM5RDEyRTk5MzcyMjRCMzFBREY2QUEzMTJBOUM2QzVFQGRhdmlkZnJ4dGE5ZzBsPg==","referencesHeader":"PDY1Qzc5NTIzLTQ1ODEtNENENC04OTY1LTI3QTgzNTQyQjMwMUBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDY2ODRGQTNFLTY0OTQtNEQ2Ny1BMzI2LUE4QjI4MTY1NjUzMEBjb21jYXN0Lm5ldD4gPDRFOTFEQ0I0LTAwMUMtNDI2NS05RjRCLUIyNDIwQzBCNUFBN0BTYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4gPDBDNDRDQTkzQkRERDQ3NzM5OEMwNDgzRkI0QjMxMDBEQGRhdmlkZnJ4dGE5ZzBsPiA8QzlDQkI5RDktQkE2RS00RjVFLThCMjEtQ0MzMjM3MEQzMzk2QFNhbmRyYWRvZGQuY29tPiA8QzlEMTJFOTkzNzIyNEIzMUFERjZBQTMxMkE5QzZDNUVAZGF2aWRmcnh0YTlnMGw+"},"prevInTopic":46596,"nextInTopic":46598,"prevInTime":46596,"nextInTime":46598,"topicId":46574,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"-=-I m sure it could be learned elsewhere, although I m not sure how. - =- I learned to be really present with my children and to care what they felt and to","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-879305162\">-=-I&#39;m sure it could be learned elsewhere, although I&#39;m not sure how. - <br/>\n=-<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned to be really present with my children and to care what they  <br/>\nfelt and to meet their needs from La Leche League.

I put the giraffe puppet on my right hand  <br/>\nand the jackal puppet on my left. I told the giraffe puppet what was  <br/>\ngoing on for me, and she offered me empathy by guessing my feelings  <br/>\nand needs. The jackal, meanwhile, interjected to my son every once in  <br/>\na while. &quot;Arrrrr!&quot; he would start, in the angriest voice I could  <br/>\nmuster. &quot;Hitting will solve it!&quot; My son looked concerned and said to  <br/>\nthe jackal: &quot;No, don&#39;t hit! Talk about it!&quot; This was a role reversal!  <br/>\nMy son was educating the jackal on the merits of nonviolent conflict  <br/>\nresolution.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce people are old enough not to need hand-puppet role play, it seems  <br/>\nto me that pretending to be a giraffe isn&#39;t as good as direct  <br/>\ninformation about being a *person.*<br/>\n<br/>\n-=-I&#39;m sure it could be learned elsewhere, although I&#39;m not sure how. - <br/>\n=-<br/>\n<br/>\nOn this list, on Joyce&#39;s site on just about every page<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://joyfullyrejoycing.com\">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd these come to mind without searching the 800 or so unschooling  <br/>\npages on my site:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully\">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/mindfulparenting\">http://sandradodd.com/mindfulparenting</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/partners\">http://sandradodd.com/partners</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/choices\">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren\">http://sandradodd.com/youngchildren</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/peace\">http://sandradodd.com/peace</a><br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/respect\">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandradodd.com/rules\">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>\nwhere Deb Lewis is quoted with these good points:<br/>\n**************<br/>\nA principle internally motivates you to do the things that seem good  <br/>\nand right.

There are just things<br/>\nin life that get you down and cause unhappiness, no matter how hard you<br/>\ntry to think positively about things.  As long as you don&#39;t get stuck in<br/>\nsad, happiness comes around again.  The more your daily life is focused<br/>\non that, the easier it is to pick yourself up from sad and get back to<br/>\nhappy, thinking positively helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps its just me, but when I get to that place where everything seems<br/>\nto be going wrong, I can take each of those points of wrong and find<br/>\ngood ways to see things.  I really wish I could live in a bigger house,<br/>\nbut I have a pretty decent place to live and I can find all the positive<br/>\nthings in it, instead of focusing on how much I&#39;d like to get out of<br/>\nthis teeny little house and move into a bigger one, and simultaneously<br/>\nput it out there that I WILL live in a better house soon, when the<br/>\ntiming is right.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;&gt;&gt; And about NVC stuff - I suspect if normal communication seems<br/>\n </span></blockquote>violent or threatening to some people they&#39;re suffering from emotional<br/>\ninstability.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nKids that grow up with more traditional parenting, where they are not<br/>\ntreated with respect, where they are controlled and manipulated, will<br/>\ngrow up believing that this is &quot;normal&quot; communication.

That&#39;s part of some self improvement thought, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve seen it used when a mom required something of her kid.

A child crying over a lost toy is feeling his authentic feelings which is part of healthy self understanding.  <br/>\nHer authentic self is maybe too self focused to realize that helping him find the toy, or getting him another, will help him feel the authentic feelings of happiness and trust.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI wondered a few years ago if &quot;being authentic&quot; came from the people who were disappointed in or disillusioned by all the power of positive thinking stuff.
