I have an oppositional and agressive son<br/>\nlike this.  He is five, and has had the behaviors you<br/>\ndescribe at least since sometime after his brother was<br/>\nborn.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSome things we do to help him maintain more control of<br/>\nhimself and feel less angry:<br/>\nLet him sleep in our bed at night (which his brother<br/>\nhas no interest in doing) so he can cuddle with us.<br/>\nHold him when he is feeling grumpy.<br/>\nSince he and my husband both rise early, they spend<br/>\ntime cuddling in the mornings before breakfast.<br/>\nRespond to sibling arguments by offering to play or do<br/>\nsomething with them, or let them choose another<br/>\nactivityuwhich distracts them from whatever their<br/>\nproblem was.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes though, when he is just having a<br/>\nparticularly difficult day, it is overstimulation for<br/>\nhim.  He is hyperactive and gets that way sometimes,<br/>\nor occassionally it may be allergy related, as he has<br/>\na LOT of allergies.  When he just is not fit company<br/>\nfor other living beings, we ask him to please spend<br/>\nsome time alone until he feels like being decent to<br/>\npeople.  This defusing time is sometimes JUST what he<br/>\nneeds.  We used to enforce his taking time in his<br/>\nroom, but he has learned how effective this is and<br/>\ngives himself time alone when he is feeling really bad<br/>\nand let&#39;s no one come in his room.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also try very hard to model loving,<br/>\nnon-confrontational, non-agressive problem solving and<br/>\npatient and affectionate relations.  Some days I<br/>\nmarvel at how great he is doing, and other days I am<br/>\ncrying to myself, marveling at what a rotten mom I<br/>\nmust be.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt&#39;s really difficult to have these kinds of kids,<br/>\nbecause other people are so judgemental.  They ask you<br/>\nthings like &quot;Why do you Let him act that way?&quot;  like<br/>\nit&#39;s something we encourage in him.  Maybe they would<br/>\nrather I screamed and beat on him or something. <br/>\n(shrug)  I tend to think that kids like these are just<br/>\nREALLY passionate and sensative.  Think what creative<br/>\ndepths they have!  I am breathlessly waiting to see<br/>\nwhat he does with all this when he is older.  ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nNanci K.<br/>\n<br/>\n__________________________________________________<br/>\nDo You Yahoo!?<br/>\nSend FREE video emails in Yahoo!
