Because we don&#39;t stick to the school  <br/>\nschedule of learning we potentially draw government attention to all  <br/>\nhomeschoolers and potentially cause legislatures to create  <br/>\nregulations that will allow the government to check up on  <br/>\nhomeschooling families.<br/>\n<br/>\nHSLDA doesn&#39;t want government intrusion into homeschooling. (Nor do  <br/>\nother homeschoolers.) But they don&#39;t mind regulation that favors  <br/>\nschool at homers -- like periodic testing -- since most of their  <br/>\nmembers are. There&#39;s the interesting case of Michigan that went from  <br/>\nno regulation to more difficult:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nhen.org/leginfo/detail_code.asp?StateCode=Michigan\">http://www.nhen.org/leginfo/detail_code.asp?StateCode=Michigan</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe first part is state information and you can scroll down to &quot;The  <br/>\nhearing procedure required by the Michigan Supreme Court in Bennett  <br/>\neffectively freed home schooling families from any regulation&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pertinent section is:<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; This was the state of the law until the Legislature enacted the  <br/>\n&gt; Revised School Code in December, 1995. Under the influence of a  <br/>\n&gt; misguided state senator [he admitted this when faced with the  <br/>\n&gt; problems created by the Revised School Code] who was a new home  <br/>\n&gt; schooler, the Senate inserted a provision defining home-schooling  <br/>\n&gt; in terms of a separate exemption to the compulsory attendance law,  <br/>\n&gt; the infamous subsection (3)(f). This so-called exemption was made  <br/>\n&gt; even more onerous in the Michigan House under the guidance of a  <br/>\n&gt; home-schooling representative who was closely allied with HSLDA.  <br/>\n&gt; The exemption was expanded in the House to include standards that  <br/>\n&gt; would have permitted local school district officials to closely  <br/>\n&gt; regulate home schooling families. Most importantly, the legislative  <br/>\n&gt; change defining home schooling upset the status quo that had been  <br/>\n&gt; in place since the Supreme Court decisions two and a half years  <br/>\n&gt; earlier. There would inevitably be a new round of law suits and  <br/>\n&gt; prosecutions, with uncertain results, to interpret and clarify the  <br/>\n&gt; new law. Our peace had been shattered. The legal situation  <br/>\n&gt; surrounding home-schooling was neither certain nor clear.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; As soon as those in the home schooling community realized what had  <br/>\n&gt; been done to them, a coalition of home schooling families was  <br/>\n&gt; formed of those opposed to the change in the law. From this  <br/>\n&gt; coalition, two approaches were developed. First, an effort would be  <br/>\n&gt; made to obtain the repeal of the new law to return the legal  <br/>\n&gt; situation to the peace we had after the 1993 Michigan Supreme Court  <br/>\n&gt; decisions. Second, a network would be formed to keep home schooling  <br/>\n&gt; families aware of developments that could affect them. This was the  <br/>\n&gt; origin of the Home Education Communication Network of Michigan  <br/>\n&gt; [HECNM], which may become operational in the near future. The  <br/>\n&gt; repeal of subsection (3)(f) was opposed by the Information Network  <br/>\n&gt; for Christian Homes [INCH] and HSLDA. They claimed that the new law  <br/>\n&gt; was a major improvement!!<br/>\n </span></blockquote>Joyce</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":2523747,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;fetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Legal Problems in CT","postDate":"1172394451","msgId":28099,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDVEMjlBQjQwLTI5ODItNDcyNC05Q0RBLUFCNjZCM0I4Njc4RUBlYXJ0aGxpbmsubmV0Pg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDQ2MjgxMC4yNDU0Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MjMwNC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4=","referencesHeader":"PDQ2MjgxMC4yNDU0Ny5xbUB3ZWI1MjMwNC5tYWlsLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":28098,"nextInTopic":28101,"prevInTime":28098,"nextInTime":28100,"topicId":28084,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

They <br/>\nare wonderful! I think it&#39;s www.hsld.org.  If not, just do a search.  <br/>\nIt&#39;s $100/yr. per family to join.  After that, they will do <br/>\neverything possible to defend your right to homeschool at no <br/>\nadditional charge.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck to you,<br/>\n<br/>\nSandi Graff<br/>\nHawaii<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt; <br/>\n </span></blockquote>______________________________________________________________________<br/>\n______________<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> &gt; Need a quick answer?
