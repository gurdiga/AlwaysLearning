It&#39;s about 5 to 10 min north of Paramus.<br/>\nIt seems that nowadays, the Blue Law is only in Bergen County.  <br/>\nSo, on Sundays, if people want to go shopping for anything <br/>\nexcept food or gas, they need to go outside of the county. <br/>\nHubby and I spent many Sundays at the mall in Nanuet, NY <br/>\nand in Clifton, NJ for that very reason.  There&#39;s an awesome<br/>\nchildren&#39;s clothing store in Clifton called the Childrenswear <br/>\nCentre that sells brand name clothes at up to 80% off of <br/>\ndepartment store prices. I got lots of my girls clothing there!  <br/>\nHowever, I&#39;m looking at the website now and it seems the <br/>\nClifton store may have moved.  Here&#39;s the link if anyone is <br/>\ninterested,,,, <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.netkidswear.com/chilcennet.html\">http://www.netkidswear.com/chilcennet.html</a><br/>\n <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"ireply\"> &gt;   I remember in Somerville, NJ, on Sundays you couldn&#39;t but clothes.  I was <br/>\n&gt; very young then, so other items might have been restricted, but  I don&#39;t <br/>\n&gt; remember.  I do remember that you could go into the stores.

They do let you buy<br/>\nthings like toilet paper, paper towels, diapers and tampons though,<br/>\nthank goodness!!  But, nothing *unnecessary* like greeting cards,<br/>\nwrapping paper, books, crayons, batteries, etc,,,  If a store has <br/>\nfood AND those goods,,,,the goods affected by the Blue Law are<br/>\nroped off.  However, if a store has NO food at all,,,the entire store<br/>\nis closed (like ToysRUs, Hallmark,,,ALL shopping malls, etc,,,) <br/>\nMovie theaters remain open however.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I was there, there was this one article in the newspaper <br/>\nabout how ToysRUs wanted their internet sales and marketing <br/>\nteam who handled internet orders to be able to work on Sundays<br/>\n(because people BUY things over the internet on Sundays from<br/>\nall over the world and these people needed to be able to keep<br/>\ntrack of inventory and such).  Bergen County said NO way even <br/>\nthough they were in an office that wasn&#39;t even in the ToysRUs <br/>\ntoy store!!  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it seems all businesses not selling food or gas had to be <br/>\nclosed on Sundays too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was VERY inconvenient for most of my husband&#39;s family to<br/>\ndo any shopping at all since they all ran drycleaners that were<br/>\nopen 7 to 7, Monday through Saturday.  Thus, leaving only<br/>\nSunday for shopping,,,,,and of course, they couldn&#39;t go shopping<br/>\non Sundays either because that was the day for GOLF!!
