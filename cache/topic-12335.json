We attended the Boston Science <br/>\nFiction film Marathon (24 Hours). I took Julian for the second year, and my <br/>\nbest friend Melissa, from CT, took her son Nick. Julian and Nick are best <br/>\nfriends, born 4 days apart.  Melissa and I attended the Marathon together <br/>\nwhen we were in college, then last year we took the boys. It was fun, some <br/>\nvery cool movies. And Nick will be here with us for the week.<br/>\n<br/>\nNick started attending a Sudbury Valley near Hartford this year, and is very <br/>\nhappy with it. We like it because he has more flexibility about visiting us <br/>\nthan when he was in public school, and because Nick is SOOOO happy with his <br/>\nnew school. <br/>\n<br/>\nKathryn<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":12331,"nextTopicId":12328}}
