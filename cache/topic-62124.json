I would like to say Hello and I too have an only (4 yr old daughter). This past May our family attended the Unschoolers Waterpark Gathering and attended an Unschooling an Only Child discussion. There were about 8 of us and I also met another family at the Conference with an only. It was great to meet like minded parents who are facing the same worries. During the discussion it was suggested to begin a yahoo group Unschoolingonlies. Feel free to join! <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your daughter noticing large families in books, my daughter had noticed she was the only child that did not have a sibling of most of my husband and my friends. I have recently made a huge effort to set up meet ups with other only children so my daughter could see, although rare, she is not the only one without a sibling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you well in your quest to finding local homeschooling/unschooling only children families, we are still looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nZakiya<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><span title=\"qreply\"> --- In <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com\">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;angelovfaith&quot; &lt;AngelOvFaith@...&gt; wrote:<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; Havnt come across anyone unschooling or homeschooling with only children yet...we are new this year, having last day of school be in June, so a family member expressed concern about companionship other than myself.<br/>\n&gt; We&#39;ve been attending local unschooling meetups since winter, plus joined/read every blog, or online group we could find, yet still have not seem to *found* anyone else.
