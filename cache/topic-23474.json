The last 4 years, I have spent as an activist for peace and human rights (especially refugees and asylum seekers) on the Internet; I&#39;m also books author and ebooks publisher. I have launched many campaigns to improve our situation as refugees in Lebanon and hopefully bring more understanding to our problems worldwide. I helped make many changes and improvements at the UNHCR office in Beirut; I used the Internet as the field for my activities (you can read more about that in my free ebook &#39;MY CAMPAIGNS&#39;). All my ebooks are free and could be download from my sites.<br/>\n <br/>\nThis is my newest campaign, it&#39;s about the illegal and humiliating actions of the UNHCR, who using photos of refugees as banners and human-buttons to collect money. This is an abuse of the dignity and humanity of the refugees and must stop immediately and a clear public apology present by The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My friends, I am talking about the pictures you can see here: <br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ccc.1asphost.com/un77\">http://ccc.1asphost.com/un77</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhere you can read the rest of this message as web page.<br/>\n <br/>\nFor more info about UNHCR and life of refugees you can read my free ebooks. I invite you as fellow humans and members of the world community to support my campaign by reading my article on my site and see the human-buttons. The campaign is to support and improve the UNHCR <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unhcr.ch\">http://www.unhcr.ch</a> especially after the last scandals in the UN and UNHCR, just for example: <br/>\n <br/>\nThe refugees allege that UNHCR staff is selling most of the food items they are supposed to be supplied.<br/>\n&quot;They aren&#39;t supplying sufficient food to us because they sell most of the food items,&quot; they allege: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200503140214.html\">http://allafrica.com/stories/200503140214.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere is another example: Burmese Refugees Withdraw Protest Against UNHCR  <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mizzima.com/archives/news-in-2005/news-in-april/12-April05-22.htm\">http://www.mizzima.com/archives/news-in-2005/news-in-april/12-April05-22.htm</a><br/>\n<br/>\n&quot;We make demonstration and fast because the UNHCR office in Cairo did nothing for our problem...&quot; <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4440730.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4440730.stm</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTogether we will build better world.<br/>\n <br/>\nYou could reach me fast via this form: <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unhcr.us/email_me.htm\">http://www.unhcr.us/email_me.htm</a> and if you like to know more about me, you can google for my name &#39;osam altaee&#39;. <br/>\n <br/>\nThanks<br/>\nTHE TRUTH WARRIOR<br/>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.oddworldz.com/unhcr\">http://www.oddworldz.com/unhcr</a></div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":23472,"nextTopicId":23476}}
