I do like high-energy teachers -- but not those that have <br/>\n&quot;tricks&quot; that they pull out in order to be more entertaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t care if teachers are super well-organized. I just care that they know <br/>\nstuff and can communicate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo - I end up being a teacher who is like that. Not super well-organized (I <br/>\ncan take off on tangents and find my way full circle back to the starting <br/>\npoint though) and high energy and, oh yeah, I start off the semester and <br/>\nrepeat throughout the semester that the only difference between a student and <br/>\na teacher is that I have expertise in THIS subject that they don&#39;t have and <br/>\npresumably want to acquire. But that any other day THEY could be the teacher <br/>\nand I could be the student wanting to acquire expertise that they have. AND I <br/>\nadd that there are big gaps in my knowledge about economics (the subject I <br/>\nteach) and some of them might very likely know more about certain specific <br/>\nareas than I do and, if they do, they should speak up so we can all learn <br/>\nmore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think they think I&#39;m just saying that -- but later on they find out that my <br/>\narea of economics doesn&#39;t include the stock market, for example, and <br/>\noccasionally we get someone in a class who really is a stock market whiz and <br/>\nI help them (by leading questions and stuff) explain things to the rest of <br/>\nthe class, based on their own real-life and recent experience - much better <br/>\nthan my textbook-based explanations &lt;G&gt;.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing I do in my classes is have them make up their own semester <br/>\nproject. Every econ class student is required to do a semester project and in <br/>\nALL the other classes this is a 20-page &quot;research&quot; paper. Well - I point out <br/>\nthat they aren&#39;t doing actual &quot;research&quot; - that they&#39;re doing what is called <br/>\na &quot;survey of the literature&quot; and that is fine, if that&#39;s what they&#39;d like to <br/>\ndo. But they can do real research, if they want. They can do surveys, for <br/>\nexample. And I tell them they can take ANY of their passions, hobbies, other <br/>\nclasses, career goals, work, etc. and make up a project that relates that to <br/>\neconomics. I give the example of a student who was taking a class in <br/>\nPhotography: Contemporary Issues. She did a fantastic set of photos comparing <br/>\nhow the really rich live versus the really poor - in Los Angeles. She did a <br/>\nlittle reading to go along with it and wrote up some information income <br/>\ndistribution and stuff like that too. A couple of people have done poster <br/>\ncollages, with an economic theme - one was on &quot;The American Dream.&quot; I&#39;ve had <br/>\na couple of videos - one was a guy who went out and interviewed workers in <br/>\ndifferent kinds of occupations and asked them about their work and their <br/>\nfeelings about it and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI give a number of suggestions - for those who can&#39;t think up an assignment <br/>\nfor themselves. And most use my suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n--pam<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":3339,"nextTopicId":3506}}
