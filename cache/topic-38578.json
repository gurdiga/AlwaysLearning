I don&#39;t have any fear of that happening now<br/>\n&gt; even though I would have been somewhat worried when she was 4 or 5. However<br/>\n&gt; she had no desire to be separated from me at that time, so it was actually<br/>\n&gt; rather easy to make or find fun activities for us to be at together.<br/>\n<br/>\n </span></blockquote>That is something that I have been concerned about as well.  Some<br/>\nteachers treat children in a way that I do not like.  I think that<br/>\nwhen she is older it won&#39;t be as much of a problem, but it is<br/>\nsomething that I pay a lot of attention to now as it is hard to stand<br/>\nup to a teacher when you are 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example:  her first swim lesson was a private lesson.  My daughter<br/>\nloves swimming and was excited about the lesson, but the teacher had<br/>\nher in tears within 5 minutes.  No empathy and telling her to use her<br/>\nwords and ignoring the tears.  My daughter is VERY good at explaining<br/>\nhow she feels so she had to be really upset for this to happen. (I<br/>\nwent over as soon as I saw that she was crying, but her back was to me<br/>\nso it took a minute)  I went over and invited her to come out of the<br/>\npool.  After a very wet hug and some snuggles I had a talk with the<br/>\nteacher.  Rebecca did want to keep going so we finished the lesson and<br/>\nthe teacher was nice and didn&#39;t push her this time.  Some classes<br/>\ndon&#39;t let you be in the room to watch and you can&#39;t be there for your<br/>\nkid to help if something like that happens.  I don&#39;t like those<br/>\nclasses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for choosing classes, I have looked at her and what she does and<br/>\nthought about what she might like.  I tell her about it and if she is<br/>\ninterested, we can give it a try.  The local gymnastics classes offer<br/>\na free trial class.  Other places do as well.  You may be able to go<br/>\nwatch a class or ask if you can pay for one class and then decide<br/>\nafter that.  Parks and Rec classes and teams are less likely to do<br/>\nthat as there is a spot that fills up... but perhaps on Saturdays you<br/>\ncan drive by the fields and watch a game for a few minutes every few<br/>\nmonths - whatever is in season.  I&#39;ve been thinking about taking the<br/>\nkids to high school games, too.  I think it might be fun to watch.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe didn&#39;t do any classes at all until she was 4.5.  We tried story<br/>\ntime at the library and I just didn&#39;t think she would be all that<br/>\ninterested in a structured activity based on our experience there.<br/>\nI&#39;ve done some mommy and me classes with my son (he wanted to do<br/>\ngymnastics too) and they did really want him to sit and listen a lot<br/>\nmore than he wanted to, but since the moms are there they leave the<br/>\n&#39;discipline&#39; to the moms so it worked out fairly well.  He enjoyed<br/>\nthem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;ve also stayed away from classes like art b/c we can do it at home<br/>\nand I don&#39;t want an art teacher telling my daughter that only a<br/>\ncertain way is right.  I&#39;m worried about it boxing her in and<br/>\ncurtailing her creativity.  I&#39;ve also been wary of sports teams...<br/>\ncompetitiveness can bring out a very unpleasant, aggressive negative<br/>\nstreak in some coaches.  If she wanted to be on a team, I would<br/>\nprobably see if my husband or I could try coaching (you don&#39;t have to<br/>\nbe that skilled when they are 5 :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point classes aren&#39;t a huge part of what we do, but she has<br/>\ntried gymnastics, dance, swimming and soccer.  She wants another swim<br/>\nclass so we are starting that in a couple weeks.  She has been asking<br/>\nfor dance, but in her dance camp she was sobbing almost every day (but<br/>\nstill wanted to go - 5 day camp, 90 min classes) and the teacher<br/>\ndidn&#39;t want me in the class.... she wants to go back and I really<br/>\ndon&#39;t think it is a good idea given how hard things were last time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any rate - that is how classes have worked around our house so far :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMargaret</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":356893003,"authorName":"prism7513","from":"&quot;prism7513&quot; &lt;penley75@...&gt;","profile":"prism7513","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"6"},"subject":"Re: Organized activities - is there a good, or better time?","postDate":"1222487421","msgId":38765,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PGdia2FodCs1MmRhQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","inReplyToHeader":"PDIxODYzOTdCNjg4NDQ1MkJCNkFBQzdGMjIzMzhDQUM1QFJvYnluUEM+"},"prevInTopic":38764,"nextInTopic":38766,"prevInTime":38764,"nextInTime":38766,"topicId":38578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"... about being ...

I think many of these<br/>\nindividuals, while remarkable, aren&#39;t driving their own life to make<br/>\nthemselves this way.

If they end up doing something really remarkable,<br/>\nthen that&#39;s really cool, but it isn&#39;t what my goal is as a parent.  My<br/>\ngoal is to help my kids achieve what they want.  If they have absolutely<br/>\nno interest in anything remarkably huge and significant in worldly<br/>\nstandards, then I wouldn&#39;t push them.<br/>\n<br/>\nExposing kids to lots of intersting things is different than becoming<br/>\naccomplished in lots of interesting things.  I want my kids to reach<br/>\nadult hood happily doing something that they like to do.

I would say I played sonatas, but  <br/>\nI only played the fast and hard movements that involve speed and  <br/>\nbanging.  Soft, quiet, peaceful movements would have just frustrated  <br/>\nme.  I needed something physical and a little big furious.  And I  <br/>\nfound myself swinging my leg in time with the music--and my WHOLE  <br/>\nleg, knee down.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were a runner, I would&#39;ve run and run, but I&#39;m more a leg- <br/>\nbreaker and a fall-downer, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was five my parents found a piano teacher.  About a year  <br/>\nlater, 14 months, I&#39;m not sure, I quit, in tears, insisting I didn&#39;t  <br/>\nwant it anymore.  Y&#39;know what I wanted?  To watch Wagon Train.  But I  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t have the idea that maybe they could&#39;ve rescheduled my lesson.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was 12 or 13 I started lessons again, because I wanted to.  I  <br/>\nstill had practiced the things I had learned, and expanded on them.   <br/>\nI had started playing clarinet at the age of 11 (5th grade band) and  <br/>\nI was reading music at church, in choir.  So I wasn&#39;t needing the way- <br/>\ndifficult part of learning to read notation or of learning where  <br/>\nthings were on the piano.  I knew all that.  I went for several reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\ndirection<br/>\n<br/>\ncoaching<br/>\n<br/>\nto get good enough to play at church, because I had become very  <br/>\nreligious<br/>\n<br/>\nI was never really good enough to play at church.  I subbed a couple  <br/>\nof times for unimportant services, and I made mistakes and I hated that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anyway, I have had an interest in music my whole life, and in the  <br/>\nhistory and connections and theory and internationalness and  <br/>\nsnobbishness of &quot;formal musicianship,&quot; and traditions of folk music,  <br/>\nand there is a UNIVERSE of music that doesn&#39;t involve lessons.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to look at it (music, everything) as learning, instead of  <br/>\n&quot;activities.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":322244815,"authorName":"Joyce Fetteroll","from":"Joyce Fetteroll &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt;","profile":"jfetteroll","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"12"},"subject":"Re: [AlwaysLearning] Organized activities - is there a good, or better time?","postDate":"1222252196","msgId":38595,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDE1QjI0MzQ0LUI4QzQtNEY1OS1BNzQ5LTEwMkQ4MzU0QTJCOEB2ZXJpem9uLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PGdiY2RwMis4czRkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg==","referencesHeader":"PGdiY2RwMis4czRkQGVHcm91cHMuY29tPg=="},"prevInTopic":38593,"nextInTopic":38603,"prevInTime":38594,"nextInTime":38596,"topicId":38578,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"...

Not always in a grasping way, but thinking how much fun it  <br/>\nwill be for the child to excel at something they enjoy. So when the  <br/>\nchild is done, the parent can feel their own hopes for that happiness  <br/>\ncrushed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere isn&#39;t a reason for a child to burn out unless there&#39;s pressure.  <br/>\n(Usually it&#39;s external, though not always.)

The piano playing, as I<br/>\nfound out just recently from my mother, was because &quot;You used to<br/>\ntinker on it at home.&quot;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, of course we (my sister and I) did. It was all there was besides<br/>\nmy dad&#39;s trombone! And getting an embrasure out of a 6 year old would<br/>\nbe hard enough but LIFTING the trombone would have been near<br/>\nimpossible! And even 6 month old babies pound away on a keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we were subjected to lessons for 8 years, of which I gained a great<br/>\nunderstanding of music theory, but no more talent than I did when I began.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bible quizzing was something *I* picked and loved, as it gave me a<br/>\nplace to meet friends which I didn&#39;t have at my private school. And<br/>\neven after I switched to the public school (which I LOVED since people<br/>\ndidn&#39;t make fun of me!) I still loved the competition and memorization<br/>\nof quizzing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if my parents had suggested or offered or shown me other choices,<br/>\nI might have tried soccer, softball, volleyball, maybe ANOTHER<br/>\ninstrument, dance, who knows?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so when my daughter was about 3 (she&#39;ll be 6 in a month) and some<br/>\nof her peers started joining dance classes or swimming classes or<br/>\nwhatever, I wondered if I should be putting HER in a class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know that I want my kids to be aware of their options for ANY<br/>\nskill, but I&#39;m not sure how to show them all of them with the<br/>\nknowledge that they can actually TRY them if they want (in other<br/>\nwords, watching grown men on TV to my kids doesn&#39;t translate to &quot;Oh,<br/>\ncan we do that, too?&quot; - they see it as  &quot;big person&quot; activity for when<br/>\nthey grow up.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did watch America&#39;s Got Talent with them a few times to show them<br/>\nall the different things people can do, and told them, &quot;If you ever<br/>\nwant to do something you see other people do, let me know and maybe<br/>\nyou can  learn it&quot; (maybe being defendant only on if there are classes<br/>\nor videos or books or money to find a way to learn it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I argue two ways in my head: <br/>\n<br/>\nOne: The earlier they start something, then they won&#39;t be behind when<br/>\nthey are doing it for competition or something<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo: The earlier they start they will burn out sooner and hate the<br/>\nactivity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I&#39;m not sure either is true, or for that matter if classes of any<br/>\nnature at this age is good or bad or neither...<br/>\n<br/>\nI&#39;m new enough to this, and having had not background with activities<br/>\nthat were chosen by me from many choices, I&#39;m not sure what to do, if<br/>\nanything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don&#39;t believe that some day out of the blue they will say to me, &quot;I<br/>\nwant to learn how to tap dance&quot; if they&#39;ve never seen it.
