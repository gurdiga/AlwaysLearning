We had begun  <br/>\nunschooling, (or at least I thought we had) and a few months had  <br/>\npassed by and I began to get scared that our boys weren&#39;t &#39;doing&#39;  <br/>\nenough, or &#39;learning&#39; enough, and all they wanted to do was to sit  <br/>\naround and watch TV and play video games. I hit the panic button and  <br/>\nput limits on everything (TV & video games) they wanted to do. It was  <br/>\na disaster! They immediately began to &quot;do&quot; things, and as soon as I  <br/>\ngot home from work they would tell me or show me what they had  <br/>\n&quot;done&quot;, and I would ooo and ahhh over whatever it was, but soon  <br/>\nrealized that they didn&#39;t care about my oooing and ahhing, they had  <br/>\ndone &quot;it&quot; so they could get their reward--TV! In my attempt to guide  <br/>\nthem to &#39;bigger and better&#39; things, all I had done was to replace one  <br/>\nreward system (grades) with another (TV & video games). They didn&#39;t  <br/>\ncare about &#39;doing&#39; things, they only cared about doing what it took  <br/>\nto get their reward. Just like they did in school.<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil your children realize that the real reward Iaid out before them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may seem that the things you read about on these message boards,  <br/>\nand the children we all talk about here are...unique, in their true  <br/>\ndesire to learn, and you may not be able to fathom that your children  <br/>\ncould be this way too, but I&#39;ve found in our case that our children  <br/>\nare EXACTLY like the one&#39;s you read about here, all they needed was  <br/>\nthe time to get there. The way unschooled children &#39;act&#39; and learn is  <br/>\nthe way that children REALLY are, and it&#39;s school and it&#39;s mind- <br/>\nnumbing schedules and curriculums that change the way a child&#39;s mind  <br/>\nworks and dulls their view of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon&#39;t put TV up on a pedestal like I did. Let your children be free  <br/>\nto choose, and in time, their choices will amaze you. Watch TV with  <br/>\nthem, talk about what you&#39;re watching, ask them their opinions, but  <br/>\ndon&#39;t push. Don&#39;t turn it into a &#39;lesson&#39;.

To say, &quot;Well,  <br/>\nif you FEEL that way, then that&#39;s the way you feel and it must be  <br/>\nright for you.&quot; Stuff like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou posted about your feelings that tv is evil. Maybe what we should  <br/>\nhave started talking about is what to do when we have such irrational  <br/>\nstrong feelings - feelings that fly in the face of reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially given what you&#39;ve added, later, that your child IS  <br/>\nwatching a lot of tv programming, but just not on a tv in your own  <br/>\nhouse (on the computer or at other people&#39;s houses), it seems what  <br/>\nyou have is some sort of phobia about the physical equipment itself -  <br/>\nthe actual television set? A phobia - an extreme and irrational fear  <br/>\nor aversion toward something.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can avoid having a tv in your house as long as your child doesn&#39;t  <br/>\noutright ask for one - but how horrible for her to think that her  <br/>\nmommy considers something she wants to be horrible and evil. So - the  <br/>\nfirst thing I&#39;d suggest is to not pass on your own phobia to your child.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhobias can be overcome - and working at that can take a big chunk of  <br/>\nnegativity out of your own mind - one that you&#39;re so used to that you  <br/>\ndon&#39;t realize it was there until it is gone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may ALL be off base and anyone who thinks tv is really &quot;evil&quot; is  <br/>\nfree to ignore it. But it might be true for some.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd - I don&#39;t see anybody here being defensive.

Many times I&#39;ve  <br/>\nstarted to read a book and then thought, you know, this just isn&#39;t  <br/>\ndoing it for me. So I put the book down.

Will she feel it&#39;s a  <br/>\npossibility or will she just not even ask?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was teaching 12 year old kids, some of them had NO print  <br/>\nmaterial at home, at all.  Not a newspaper, not a book.  The parents  <br/>\ndidn&#39;t want it.  The parents figured there were books at school and  <br/>\nthe kids could read books there.  When I was little my parents didn&#39;t  <br/>\nown books really�my mom a few pamphlets and magazines and one  <br/>\ncookbook. They did get the newspaper, and bought us comic books and I  <br/>\nwas in a couple of kid bookclubs.  But I saw houses with nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnschooling needs access and input.<br/>\n<br/>\nSandra<br/>\n<br/>\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]</div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":109103970,"authorName":"lerato majikfaerie","from":"lerato majikfaerie &lt;elamajikfaerie@...&gt;","profile":"elamajikfaerie","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"Re: TV????","postDate":"1154937196","msgId":26612,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PDIwMDYwODA3MDc1MzE2Ljg0NDgxLnFtYWlsQHdlYjMyODA4Lm1haWwubXVkLnlhaG9vLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26594,"nextInTopic":26613,"prevInTime":26611,"nextInTime":26613,"topicId":26585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Hi, Forgive me if I m outta line, but I ve been reading all this discussion about TV, and while I agree totally with the bunking of ridiculous anti-TV","messageBody":"<div id=\"ygrps-yiv-953467481\">Hi, <br/>\nForgive me if I&#39;m outta line, but I&#39;ve been reading all this discussion<br/>\nabout TV, and while I agree totally with the bunking of ridiculous<br/>\nanti-TV &quot;evidence&quot; and I&#39;m completely on the path of not &quot;limiting&quot;<br/>\nanything, including TV, I just wanted to say how I *feel*<br/>\nI *feel* like TV is evil.  Well not &quot;evil&quot; in the christain devil and<br/>\nbrimstone sence, but for me, it&#39;s not a good thing.<br/>\nI can&#39;t really explain that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI grew up in a very secular home where we were allowed to watch as much<br/>\nTV as we liked, we came home from school and turned the TV on.  we<br/>\n&quot;zombied&quot; in front of it till dinner time, and then went straight back<br/>\nto it.  the only self-imposed respite from TV was computer games, of<br/>\nwhich we always had plenty.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel that a lot of things that are products of our modern technology<br/>\nculture are bad.  I dont know why that is.  I just feel that way.<br/>\nNow I&#39;m grown-up and I have a daughter and I guess I&#39;m what a lot of<br/>\namericans would call &quot;crunchy&quot; in the extreme.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe dont have a TV at home, simply because I dont want one.  When I stay<br/>\nsomewhere that has a TV, I still go and sit in front of it for hours<br/>\nwithout break.  That&#39;s why I dont have a TV, I dont like it&#39;s effect on<br/>\n*me*. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a computer that plays DVDs and we watch plenty of them, as<br/>\nwell as downloading loads of shows and movies.  My daughter is allowed<br/>\nto use the computer and to watch as much as she likes, I dont limit her<br/>\non that, and she&#39;s allowed to watch TV if she is somewhere that has<br/>\none.  I just choose not to have one in my house, because I *feel* that<br/>\nit&#39;s bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could follow the parents out there who feel that TV is bad, for<br/>\nwhatever reason and start quoting a bunch of &quot;evidence&quot; supporting my<br/>\nbelief, but I agree, the &quot;evidence&quot; is flawed and we can find<br/>\nstatistics that prove ANYTHING if we want.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI just wanted to share another perspective.  For some people, (me) TV<br/>\nIS bad, without needing any &quot;evidence&quot;, my feelings are valid.  Of<br/>\ncourse, that doesnt mean that I have the right to go spouting some<br/>\nillogical creed as a justification for limiting my own child in doing<br/>\nsomething that I feel is bad for me.  She does lots of things that I<br/>\nthink are revolting, like eating raspberry popsicles! ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nEla<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSend instant messages to your online friends <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://au.messenger.yahoo.com\">http://au.messenger.yahoo.com</a></div>","specialLinks":[]},{"userId":116488337,"authorName":"Gold Standard","from":"&quot;Gold Standard&quot; &lt;jacki@...&gt;","profile":"jackiknouse","replyTo":"LIST","spamInfo":{"isSpam":false,"reason":"0"},"subject":"RE: [AlwaysLearning] TV????","postDate":"1154878014","msgId":26594,"canDelete":false,"contentTrasformed":false,"systemMessage":false,"headers":{"messageIdInHeader":"PFBLRUhKR0NJR05QUEFCRlBCS0xHRUVGRkRMQUIuamFja2lAYm9hcmRwcmVwLm5ldD4=","inReplyToHeader":"PDZERjhEMEEzLTAxRjMtNDQ2QS1CRUU3LUVEQzE2REVFQUVDMEBzYW5kcmFkb2RkLmNvbT4="},"prevInTopic":26593,"nextInTopic":26612,"prevInTime":26593,"nextInTime":26595,"topicId":26585,"numMessagesInTopic":0,"msgSnippet":"Oh my goodness Sandra!
