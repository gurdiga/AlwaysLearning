The friend&#39;s mum only likes meeting up in groups as she feels people get left out otherwise, so there&#39;s no other opportunity for Finn to really meet up one to one. Finn does have a couple of other more casual friendships and social gatherings that he enjoys, but mostly at the moment he prefers to be at home. His brother, Jay (4) likes to go out/see friends at least a couple of times a week, so we find ways of doing both. One thing I suggested recently was hosting Lego Days and Minecraft LAN days at our house, which they were both really keen to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday was the first minecraft LAN day. One of Finn&#39;s friends started building, and Finn jumped straight in to help, which was not ok with his friend. I suggested making his own house or mine and letting his friend know he would like to help at some point if he wanted him to. He didn&#39;t want to do this, so I suggested maybe moving onto the other LAN world and seeing if there was something that looked fun on there, but he just insisted on interfering with his friend&#39;s building, so I brought him away from the computer. He was upset but when he calmed down I suggested we go back on and build something cool ourselves with me on the same LAN world, which he agreed to but within a couple of minutes was back annoying his friend again. I tried diverting him to other things on the server, and even another game, but he wouldn&#39;t. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe also has his own online server and sometimes a similar thing happens with one of his online friends. He&#39;s so keen to play right in there with them but doesn&#39;t yet have the skills to navigate it if they want some space, and even though I&#39;m right there with him it doesn&#39;t seem to be helping at all. I feel like he&#39;s after a closer connection with friends and I&#39;m not managing to help him get that. He gets sad when these situations happen, but then out of that situation he&#39;s perfectly happy again and it doesn&#39;t seem to be bothering him on a more general level (ie he&#39;s usually really happy doing his own thing, it&#39;s only once in the situation with these friends online that he&#39;s getting upset).<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth he and the friend from today want to do the LAN day again, and we talked about maybe next time having some stuff built in advance so that it wasn&#39;t one person&#39;s and so that there was maybe a bigger focus;   I want to partner him in what he wants to do but I&#39;m not sure if doing it again is setting him up to fail.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can&#39;t seem to get any clarity of thought myself on this, either what I could have done differently to help him or what I could do in the future or in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading,<br/>\n<br/>\nTam</div>","specialLinks":[]}],"prevTopicId":70397,"nextTopicId":70482}}
