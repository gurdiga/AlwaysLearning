The<br/>\nactors stand there (like the numbers in an equation) delivering carefully<br/>\ncrafted dialogue that has been reduced to only the necessary syllables,<br/>\nempty of emotion, that is the reality of the situation that isn&#39;t physically<br/>\nthere.

We associate flying with sky, and so for each of the black birds <br/>\nthesky in which it is flying is formed by the four white fish which <br/>\nencircleit. Similarly swimming makes us think of water, and therefore the <br/>\nfourblack birds that surround a fish become the water in which it swims. <br/>\nM.C.E.<br/>\n<br/>\nReprinted from the text M.C. Escher - The Graphic Work; with the kind <br/>\npermission of Benedikt-Taschen Publishers. <br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\nThis print has been used is physics, geology, chemistry, and in psychology <br/>\nfor the study of visual perception. In the picture a number of visual <br/>\nelements unite into a simple visual representation, but separately each forms <br/>\na point of departure for the elucidation of a theory in one of these <br/>\ndisciplines.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basis of this print is a regular division of the plane consisting of <br/>\nbirds and fish. We see a horizontal series of these elements - fitting into <br/>\neach other like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle - in the middle, transitional <br/>\nportion of the print. In this central layer the pictorial elements are equal: <br/>\nbirds and fish are alternately foreground or background, depending on whether <br/>\nthe eye concentrates on light or dark elements. The birds take on an <br/>\nincreasing three-dimensionality in the upward direction, and the fish, in the <br/>\ndownward direction. But as the fish progress downward they gradually lose <br/>\ntheir shapes to become a uniform background of sky and water, respectively. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe can think of a number of paired concepts applying to this picture: <br/>\nlight-dark, top-bottom, flat-rounded, figure-background, interlocking <br/>\npictorial elements-independent pictorial elements, geometric <br/>\nstructure-realistic form; and, with respect to the subject of the print, <br/>\nbirds-fish, sky-water, immobility-movement. Any scientist who uses a print to <br/>\nillustrate a theory selects one or more elements from the print that are <br/>\nanalogous to components of the theory, and in this way the print becomes a <br/>\nmodel for the theory.
